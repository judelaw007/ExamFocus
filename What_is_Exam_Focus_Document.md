# Exam Focus eBook: A Guide for Course Developers

## 1. What is an Exam Focus eBook?

An **Exam Focus eBook** is a textbook-style learning resource that is **informed by exam analysis but does not display it**. The reader experiences a well-structured, comprehensive textbook. Behind the scenes, the writer has meticulously analysed past exam questions to ensure the content covers what examiners actually test—and how they test it.

### 1.1. The Core Principle

The Exam Focus eBook answers a simple question: *If a student only read this material, would they naturally absorb what examiners want them to know?*

The answer should be yes—not because the book explicitly teaches exam technique, but because the content itself is shaped by exam reality.

### 1.2. How It Differs from a CheatBook

| Aspect | Exam Focus eBook | CheatBook |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Appearance** | Standard textbook | Explicit exam preparation guide |
| **Exam analysis** | Hidden (informs writing) | Visible (statistics, patterns, frameworks) |
| **Exam references** | Subtle: "(covered in June 2024)" | Prominent: frequency matrices, mark schemes |
| **Primary purpose** | Learn the subject through exam-aware content | Master exam technique and patterns |
| **When to use** | Primary study (3-6 months before exam) | Final revision (last 4 weeks) |
| **Reader experience** | "I'm reading a textbook" | "I'm learning how to pass an exam" |

The Exam Focus eBook builds knowledge; the CheatBook optimises exam performance. They complement each other—they are not duplicates.

## 2. Target Audience

Exam Focus eBooks are written for:

- **Certification candidates** preparing for professional exams (ADIT, CTA, etc.)
- **First-time exam takers** who need comprehensive subject coverage
- **Working professionals** studying part-time over 3-6 months
- **Learners who prefer textbook-style materials** over explicit exam prep guides

### 2.1. What Readers Expect

Readers of an Exam Focus eBook expect:

- Clear, comprehensive explanations of each topic
- Logical structure that builds understanding progressively
- Content that prepares them for exams without feeling like "cramming material"
- A resource they can study from start to finish as their primary text

### 2.2. What Readers Do NOT Expect

- Exam statistics and frequency matrices
- Explicit mark schemes and time allocations
- "How to answer this question type" frameworks
- Error catalogs and prevention checklists

These belong in the CheatBook—not here.

## 3. The Writer's Methodology

### 3.1. Phase 1: Exam Analysis (Behind the Scenes)

Before writing a single word, the writer must:

**3.1.1. Gather Past Exam Materials**
- Obtain 5-10 years of past exam papers
- Collect suggested answers or marking schemes
- Review examiner reports where available

**3.1.2. Analyse Question Patterns**

For each topic area, ask:
- In what context have questions been asked?
- What was expected of the student?
- What depth of knowledge did the examiner require?
- What practical applications were tested?
- What common mistakes did candidates make?

**3.1.3. Map Examined Areas**

Create a private working document (not for publication) that identifies:
- Topics that appear frequently
- Topics that appear occasionally
- Topics never examined (but on the syllabus)
- The angles from which topics are examined

This analysis informs the writing—it does not appear in the final eBook.

### 3.2. Phase 2: Research and Enrichment

After understanding what examiners test, the writer must:

**3.2.1. Research Each Topic Thoroughly**
- Use web searches to find authoritative sources
- Consult primary materials (legislation, treaties, official guidance)
- Review academic and professional commentary
- Understand current developments and debates

**3.2.2. Go Beyond Exam Requirements**

The eBook should provide genuine understanding, not just exam answers. A student who reads it should:
- Understand the principles behind the rules
- See how concepts connect to each other
- Appreciate practical implications
- Be able to apply knowledge to new situations

### 3.3. Phase 3: Writing with Exam Awareness

Now the writer produces content that:

**3.3.1. Covers Examined Areas Thoroughly**

Topics that examiners test frequently receive comprehensive treatment. The depth and detail naturally reflect exam importance—without ever saying "this is important for the exam."

**3.3.2. Addresses Examined Angles**

If examiners consistently ask about a topic from a particular perspective (e.g., practical application rather than theory), the writing emphasises that perspective.

**3.3.3. Handles Unexamined Topics Appropriately**

For topics on the syllabus but never examined:
- Cover them proportionately (they may appear in future exams)
- Write with awareness of how similar topics are typically examined
- Ensure students have sufficient understanding if a question appears

**3.3.4. Uses Subtle Exam References Only**

The maximum exam reference permitted is a parenthetical note:

> The concept of beneficial ownership has been subject to significant judicial interpretation. *(covered in June 2024)*

This allows students to cross-reference past papers if they wish—without turning the textbook into an exam guide.

## 4. Structure and Formatting

### 4.1. Hierarchical Numbering System

All Exam Focus eBooks must use consistent hierarchical numbering:

| Level | Format | Markdown | Example |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| Top-level | 1., 2., 3. | `## 1. Topic` | `## 1. Residence and Domicile` |
| Second-level | 1.1., 1.2., 2.1. | `### 1.1. Subtopic` | `### 1.1. Corporate Residence` |
| Third-level | 1.1.1., 1.2.1. | `#### 1.1.1. Sub-subtopic` | `#### 1.1.1. Central Management and Control` |

**Example Structure:**

```markdown
## 1. Tax Treaties

### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Tax Treaties

#### 1.1.1. Relieving Double Taxation

#### 1.1.2. Preventing Tax Evasion

### 1.2. The OECD Model Tax Convention

#### 1.2.1. Structure of the Model

#### 1.2.2. Key Articles
```

### 4.2. Writing Style

**4.2.1. Textbook Tone**

Write as you would for any professional textbook:
- Clear, authoritative prose
- Technical accuracy without unnecessary jargon
- Explanations that build understanding progressively
- Examples that illustrate concepts practically

**4.2.2. Exam Answer Explanatory Style**

While the tone is textbook-like, the explanations should be structured in a way that naturally teaches students how to think about problems—the same way they would need to in an exam.

This means:
- Explaining the "why" behind rules, not just the "what"
- Showing how principles apply to practical situations
- Connecting related concepts logically
- Addressing nuances and exceptions where relevant

**4.2.3. Direct and Concise**

Avoid:
- Unnecessary padding or repetition
- Academic hedging where certainty exists
- Overly complex sentence structures
- Jargon without explanation

### 4.3. What to Exclude

Exam Focus eBooks do NOT include:

| Exclude | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Conclusions | Does not add examinable knowledge |
| Key Takeaways | Belongs in CheatBook |
| Chapter Summaries | Redundant if content is clear |
| Bibliography | Not required for exam preparation |
| Learning Objectives | Unnecessary framing |
| Self-Test Questions | Belongs in separate practice materials |
| Exam Statistics | Belongs in CheatBook |
| Mark Schemes | Belongs in CheatBook |
| Time Allocation Guidance | Belongs in CheatBook |

The eBook is pure content—no meta-commentary about learning or exams.

## 6. Examples

### 6.1. Good Example: Subtle Exam Reference

> **1.3.2. The Tie-Breaker Rule**
>
> When an individual qualifies as resident in both contracting states under their domestic laws, Article 4(2) of the OECD Model provides a hierarchy of tests to determine residence for treaty purposes. The tests are applied in sequence: permanent home, centre of vital interests, habitual abode, and finally nationality. Only if all these tests fail does the matter fall to be resolved by mutual agreement between the competent authorities.
>
> The centre of vital interests test requires consideration of where the individual's personal and economic relations are closer. This involves weighing factors such as family location, employment, business interests, and social connections. *(covered in June 2023)*

**Why this works:**
- Comprehensive explanation of the concept
- Practical detail about application
- Subtle exam reference at the end
- Reads as a textbook, not exam prep

### 6.2. Bad Example: Too Exam-Focused

> **1.3.2. The Tie-Breaker Rule**
>
> ⚠️ **EXAM ALERT**: This topic appears in 80% of exams, worth 8-12 marks.
>
> When asked about treaty residence, always apply the tests in order:
> 1. Permanent home (2 marks)
> 2. Centre of vital interests (4 marks)
> 3. Habitual abode (2 marks)
> 4. Nationality (2 marks)
>
> **Common Errors**: Candidates often forget to apply tests sequentially.

**Why this fails:**
- Explicit exam statistics
- Mark allocations visible
- Error warnings included
- Reads as exam prep, not textbook
- This content belongs in a CheatBook

### 6.3. Good Example: Covering an Unexamined Topic

> **2.4.3. Arbitration Under Article 25(5)**
>
> The 2008 update to the OECD Model introduced an optional arbitration provision. Where competent authorities cannot resolve a case through mutual agreement within two years, the taxpayer may request that unresolved issues be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration decision is binding on both states, provided the taxpayer accepts it within 30 days.
>
> Adoption of this provision remains limited in practice, with many bilateral treaties omitting it entirely. However, the Multilateral Instrument has facilitated broader adoption by allowing states to opt in to arbitration provisions across multiple treaties simultaneously.

**Why this works:**
- Topic covered proportionately (not heavily examined)
- Provides genuine understanding
- No exam reference (none needed—topic not examined)
- Student is prepared if question appears

## 9. Final Note for Writers

The Exam Focus eBook occupies a specific niche: it is **more than a generic textbook** (because it is deliberately shaped by exam analysis) but **less than an exam guide** (because that explicit guidance belongs in the CheatBook).

Your job as a writer is to do the exam analysis work so thoroughly that students don't need to see it. The content itself—its depth, its angles, its emphases—naturally prepares them for what examiners will ask.

Write the textbook you wish you had when studying. Make it comprehensive, clear, and genuinely educational. Let the exam awareness be invisible—but unmistakably present in the quality and relevance of every paragraph.
