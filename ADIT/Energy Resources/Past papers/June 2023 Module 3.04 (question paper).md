3. In order to limit climate change and abate its consequences, fiscal instruments have been developed aimed

at reducing greenhouse emissions, including emission trading schemes and carbon taxation.

another within an international tax context.

Your answer should include analysis of the tax considerations that arise for both the transferor and the transferee (including potential tax liabilities), tax planning strategies, and the impact on the tax base of the countries involved.

PART C You are required to answer TWO questions from this Part.

5. The governance of oil and gas resources is a key factor in determining the type of fiscal regime to be used by

a given country. Two types of governance regime are linked to the types of fiscal system a country may use;

these are proprietorial and non-proprietorial regimes, where both the natural resources and associated assets are in government ownership.

You are required to discuss the similarities and differences between proprietorial and non-proprietorial governance regimes, and establish the connections between each of these governing regimes and the different types of petroleum fiscal system. Your discussion should focus on the tax laws, regulations and practices of the different systems. (15) 6. Windfall taxes have historically been used by governments to target the economic rent of oil and gas

companies. In May 2022, the government of the United Kingdom introduced the Energy Profit Levy. This levy targets the profits of oil and gas companies operating in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS).

You are required to discuss the impacts of this levy on the overall marginal tax rate paid by oil and gas companies in the UK, and its impact on investments by oil and gas companies in the UKCS. (15) 7. You are required to explain the concepts of ‘state equity’ and ‘carried interest’ in the oil and gas

industry, and analyse the tax and economic implications of these arrangements, including the role of state participation in the development of oil and gas resources and the allocation of risks and rewards between the state and the private sector.

You should include consideration of the impact of these arrangements on the investment climate and long-term sustainability of the oil and gas industry, provide examples of how state equity and carried interest have been implemented in practice, and evaluate the effectiveness of these arrangements.

(15) 8. You are required to explain the concept of ring-fencing as it applies to an oil and gas project, and

analyse its impacts upon both the oil and gas company and the government.

You should include examples of how ring-fencing rules have been implemented in practice and their effects on the taxation of oil and gas companies, and consider the potential impact of ring-fencing on the overall tax burden of oil and gas companies, as well as its potential effect on investment decisions and cross-border operations.
