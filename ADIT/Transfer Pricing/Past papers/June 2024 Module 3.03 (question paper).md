This exam paper has three parts: Part A, Part B and Part C.

You need to answer five questions in total. You will not receive marks for any additional answers.

You must answer:

- Both questions in Part A (25 marks each)
- One question from Part B (20 marks)
- Two questions from Part C (15 marks each)

Further instructions - All workings should be made in appropriate monetary currency, unless otherwise stated. Any monetary

calculations should be made to the nearest whole unit of currency. Any necessary time apportionments in your calculations should be made to the nearest whole month.

- You must provide appropriate line breaks between each question, and clearly indicate the start of each new
**question using the formatting tools available.**

- Marks may be allocated for clarity of presentation of your answers.
- The time you spend answering questions should correspond broadly to the number of marks available for that

half answering questions in Parts B and C.

we recommend that you set aside some time to thoroughly read each question and plan each of your answers.

- Although references and short quotes from the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines can be included in

your answer, you will not receive any marks for copying directly from the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
