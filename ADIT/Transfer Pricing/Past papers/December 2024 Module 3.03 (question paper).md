**question using the formatting tools available.**

- Marks may be allocated for clarity of presentation of your answers.

we recommend that you set aside some time to thoroughly read each question and plan each of your answers.

PART B You are required to answer ONE question from this Part.

3. The Starr group is incorporated and has its headquarters in the jurisdiction of Swickland.

The Starr group specialises in the manufacture and sale of large-scale computer servers for customers, predominantly large corporations and governments. The group has an annual turnover of approximately €1 billion, and recorded a net operating margin of 15% in the most recent fiscal year.

The Starr group operates a simplified model whereby it partners with unrelated companies in each market in which it sells computer servers to customers. Each unrelated company installs the servers and receives payment directly through the customer. The Starr group receives a commission of 2% of its invoice price for installation of Starr servers. The Starr group does not have any incorporated entities outside Swickland.

In July five Starr group employees, who are residents of Swickland, travelled to the jurisdiction of Neptunia to negotiate the sale of the most advanced computer servers for the Neptunian government. The employees met over three days with staff from the Neptunian government’s IT department, to present on the technical specifications of the equipment. Employees of Starr group were subsequently asked to return two months later to negotiate a contract for the purchase of the order, which took place over one week. This resulted in the Starr group supplying €100 million of computer servers. An unrelated company, Retro Ltd, installed the servers and invoiced the Neptunian government €15 million for the installation. The Starr group received a payment of €300,000 from Retro Ltd.

The Starr group will make a net operating margin of 19% on the sale to the Neptunian government.

The Starr group does not have a subsidiary incorporated in Neptunia and does not anticipate making any additional sales in Neptunia in the remainder of the financial year.

You are engaged as an international tax adviser for the Starr Group.

With regard to the facts provided, advise the Starr Group on how the profits from the sale to the Neptunian government should be treated, including the allocation of any profits between the jurisdictions of Swickland and Neptunia. You should provide appropriate references in support of your advice. (20)

4. The Fluffy group is one of the largest and most famous multinational groups in the world, having been operating

since 1912. Its brand is recognised in all jurisdictions in which it operates. The Fluffy group has its ultimate parent entity (UPE) located in the United States, and has incorporated subsidiaries in each country in which it sells its product. The UPE retains legal and economic ownership of the Fluffy brand name, which is applied to all products which it manufactures. The largest markets by sales value are the US, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Japan, Brazil and India.

The Fluffy group manufactures and distributes ovens, dishwashers, fridges and similar products, as well as providing after sales services in markets in which its products are sold.

Subsidiaries undertake the manufacture of products in the US, Germany and Japan, under a model whereby each subsidiary has full responsibility for employing and training staff to manufacture the products, sourcing materials, forecasting demand and arranging transportation to associated enterprise distributors.

The distributors, which are also group subsidiaries, sell the manufactured products to unrelated retailers. The Fluffy group has a transfer pricing policy, whereby it seeks to achieve a transactional net margin of 4% of sales.

The chief financial officer (CFO) of the Fluffy group has contacted you with a proposal, the key aspects of which are as follows:

- The US, German and Japanese subsidiaries will discontinue manufacturing operations immediately.
- The US subsidiary will loan the Brazilian subsidiary $200 million to acquire land, buildings and

equipment to manufacture all products for the Fluffy group. The US subsidiary will borrow the $200 million from a New York bank at an interest rate of 5% and will loan it to the Brazilian subsidiary at an interest rate of 4%.

- No changes will be made to distribution arrangements (i.e. the existing transfer pricing policy will apply

to distributors).

- The existing manufacturers will sell the plant, equipment, land and buildings currently used to undertake

manufacturing.

- Significant redundancy compensation packages will be offered to staff who currently undertake

manufacturing.

- Technical staff will train new staff in Brazil on the manufacturing processes, and will prepare detailed

documentation setting out the current manufacturing processes.

- As the current manufacturers have earned healthy profits over the years (margins averaging around

9%), they don’t need to be compensated and will absorb the costs resulting from their cessation of manufacturing.

- The Brazilian subsidiary will undertake contract manufacturing for the US subsidiary, under its direction.
- The Brazilian subsidiary will earn a margin of cost plus 5%.
- Around $50 million of synergies are expected to be realised each year based on preliminary calculations,

including material tax savings.

You are required to provide the following preliminary advice to the Fluffy group CFO:

1) Identify the key transfer pricing issues relating to the proposal. (15) 2) Advise on any potential transfer pricing risks and obligations to which Fluffy Group may be subject, including from the US, German, Japanese and Brazilian tax administrations, should the proposal proceed in its current form.
