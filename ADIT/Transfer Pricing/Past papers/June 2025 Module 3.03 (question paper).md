Sapupo Group is listed on the Newvania Stock Exchange, with its financial accounts published regularly. It operates as a multinational group, through wholly owned subsidiary companies located in several key jurisdictions. Sapupo Group’s main operations encompass the development, design, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of mobile phones and related products.

Sapupo Group is the owner of the intellectual property (IP) for all physical products which it sells. it does not sell or market any physical goods of independent parties.

Sapupo Group sources the online apps from independent parties, who are developers or owners of the apps. In the 2024 fiscal year, 20% of Sapupo Group’s total sales came from the sale of online apps.

Sapupo Group is a global market leader in the mobile phone market, being in the largest three by sales in each continent.

3. AI Connect Pty Ltd (AI Connect), tax resident in Fastria, is a company specialising in the implementation of

artificial intelligence software into computer networks for various corporations. The intellectual property (IP) attached to the software is legally registered in Fastria.

The chief executive officer (CEO), chief operating officer (COO) and senior software engineer (SSE) of AI Connect recently met with Accounting Solutions Ltd (AS), a large accounting firm, to propose the implementation of the software for AS. AS is an independent enterprise based in Greshia, not associated with AI Connect.

The managing partner of AS subsequently advised the CEO of AI Connect of AS’s decision to enter into a contract for the implementation of the software. The CEO, COO and SSE returned physically to Greshia to meet with AS’s managing partner and successfully negotiate and execute the contract.

The software implementation was conducted as a project over a 12-month period in Greshia. AI Connect sent the following staff to Greshia to assist with the project implementation:

- The SSE;
- One local liaison officer;
- One marketing and communications manager;
- Three operations managers;
- One delivery lead;
- One systems operations manager;
- Six software engineers;
- 20 customer service agents; and
- One project manager, who would report weekly to the CEO and COO.

Given the complex nature of the systems operated by AS, the software implementation was not as streamlined as initially planned and required manipulation of the software code by the software engineers, to successfully integrate into AS’s systems. This final code development for the project in Greshia was then registered separately as IP in Fastria.

AI Connect has not registered a company, branch or permanent establishment in Greshia.

You are a tax auditor for the Greshia tax administration, and have commenced an audit in relation to this project.

You are required to answer the following questions:

1) What transfer pricing risks would you identify in relation to this project? You should provide arguments in support of your responses. (15) 2) How would you treat the allocation of any income derived from the project? (5) Total (20)

4. Nutrition Corp. is the ultimate parent entity of a multinational group of enterprises, recognised for its range of

natural health, beauty and nutritional products. Nutrition Corp. is tax resident in Country X, where the headline corporate tax rate is 30%.

Nutrition Corp. performs research and development (R&D), manufacturing, distribution, procurement, logistics, sales and marketing, and support services (including accounting, legal and human resources). It has associated enterprises in more than 40 countries, each of which distributes the products to independent customers in its respective country and also performs a sales and marketing function. The associated enterprises are reimbursed by Nutrition Corp. with a target operating margin of 5%. Nutrition Corp. holds legal ownership of all intellectual property (IP). It averages an annual operating margin of 35%.

A restructuring proposal has been presented to the board of directors of Nutrition Corp., with the goal of achieving cost and tax savings. Key points contained within the proposal include:

a) Establishment of Nutrition Sub A, tax resident in Country A, where the corporate tax headline rate is 15%. It would perform the manufacturing of the products for the group, and the manufacturing facility owned and operated by Nutrition Corp. would cease. All R&D activities for the group would be performed by Nutrition Sub A rather than Nutrition Corp.

b) Establishment of Nutrition Sub B, tax resident in Country B, where the corporate tax headline rate is 20%. It would become a service provider hub and perform all of the services currently undertaken by Nutrition Corp.

c) Establishment of Nutrition Sub C, tax resident in Country C, where the corporate tax headline rate is 10%. All legal ownership of IP would be transferred from Nutrition Corp. to Nutrition Sub C. Nutrition Sub C would have no employees, but would have two registered directors in Country C.

d) A royalty of 5% of sales would be paid by all of the associated enterprises (distributors) within the group to Nutrition Sub C.

e) All employees of Nutrition Corp. would be transferred to either Nutrition Sub A or Nutrition Sub B.

f) Nutrition Corp. would provide a loan to Nutrition Sub B at an interest rate of 12%. Nutrition Corp.

maintains a distribution function.

A double tax agreement is in operation between Country X and Country B, that provides for a reduction in interest withholding tax from 15% to 5%.

As the group’s transfer pricing adviser, you are required to provide a report to the board of directors of Nutrition Corp., articulating all transfer pricing implications and risks that may arise as a result of the restructuring of the group. (20)
