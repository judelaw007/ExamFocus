government levels is essential for analyzing treaty coverage
and avoiding double taxation at multiple jurisdictional levels.

INDIRECT RELEVANCE:
• Article 2(1) OECD MTC: Covers taxes "imposed on behalf of a
  Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local
  authorities"

## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION

### 1. Federal vs. Unitary Systems

Countries organize their tax systems based on their constitutional structure:

| System | Characteristics | Examples |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Federal** | Multiple levels of government with independent taxing powers | USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, India, Brazil |
| **Unitary** | Single central government holds primary taxing authority | UK, France, Japan, Italy, New Zealand |
| **Quasi-Federal** | Constitutionally unitary but highly decentralized | Spain, Colombia |

### 2. Key Statistics (OECD 2023 Data)

**Federal Countries (8 OECD members)**:
| Government Level | Average Revenue Share |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Central government | 53.1% |
| Social security funds | 21.5% |
| State/regional level | 17.6% |
| Local level | 7.5% |

**Unitary Countries (28 OECD members)**:
| Government Level | Average Revenue Share |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Central government | 64.8% |
| Social security funds | 25.0% |
| Local level | 9.8% |

**Range of Variation**:
- Central government share: 29.9% (France) to 93.5% (New Zealand)
- Local government share: 0.6% (Estonia) to 35.7% (Sweden)

### 3. Fiscal Federalism: The Theory

**Definition**: Fiscal federalism is an economic framework for understanding the division of spending and taxing powers among different levels of government.

**Core Principles** (Richard Musgrave, 1959):

| Government Function | Best Level | Rationale |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Stabilization** | Federal/Central | Only national government large enough to affect overall economic activity |
| **Redistribution** | Federal/Central | Prevents "race to the bottom" in welfare provision |
| **Allocation** | State/Local | Better knowledge of local preferences and needs |

**Tax Assignment Principles**:

| Tax Type | Recommended Level | Reasoning |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Taxes on mobile bases (capital, corporate income) | Central | Prevent tax competition, base flight |
| Taxes on less mobile bases (property, sales) | State/Local | Geographic connection to services |
| Personal income tax | Shared | Can work at multiple levels |

---

### 4. Levels of Government and Their Taxes

#### Federal/Central Government

| Typical Taxes | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Personal income tax | Progressive rates, broad base |
| Corporate income tax | Uniform rate nationwide |
| VAT/GST | National consumption tax |
| Customs duties | Border levies |
| Social security taxes | Earmarked for specific programs |

#### State/Regional Government

| Typical Taxes | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| State income tax | May piggyback on federal base |
| State sales tax | Rates vary by state |
| State corporate tax | May differ from federal |
| Motor vehicle taxes | Registration, fuel |

#### Local/Municipal Government

| Typical Taxes | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Property tax | Primary local revenue source |
| Local income tax | Limited adoption |
| Business license taxes | Local business taxes |
| User fees | Service-specific charges |

---

### 5. Country Examples

#### United States

```
Federal Level (IRS):
• Personal income tax: 10-37% progressive
• Corporate income tax: 21% flat
• Payroll taxes: Social Security, Medicare
• No VAT/national sales tax

State Level (50 states):
• State income tax: 0% (9 states) to 13.3% (California)
• State sales tax: 0% (5 states) to 7.25% (California)
• State corporate tax: 0% (6 states) to 11.5% (New Jersey)

Local Level (thousands of jurisdictions):
• Property tax: Primary source (average ~1% of value)
• Local income tax: 16 states allow
• Local sales tax: Additional to state tax
```

**Note on DTAs**: U.S. tax treaties generally **exclude** state and local taxes from coverage (except for non-discrimination provisions).

#### Canada

```
Federal Level (CRA):
• Personal income tax: 15-33% progressive
• Corporate income tax: 15%
• GST: 5%

Provincial Level (10 provinces, 3 territories):
• Provincial income tax: 4% to 21%
• Provincial sales tax (PST): 0% to 10%
• Provincial corporate tax: 8% to 16%
• Harmonized Sales Tax (HST): Combined GST+PST in some provinces

Municipal Level:
• Property tax: Primary revenue source
• Business taxes: Limited
```

#### Germany

```
Federal Level (Bundesregierung):
• Personal income tax: Shared with states
• Corporate tax: Shared
• VAT: Shared with states
• Insurance tax

State Level (16 Länder):
• Share of income tax revenue
• Inheritance tax
• Real property transfer tax

Municipal Level:
• Trade tax (Gewerbesteuer): Major local tax
• Property tax
• Local excises
```

## B. TREATY COVERAGE OF SUBNATIONAL TAXES

### Article 2(1) OECD Model Tax Convention

> "This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and on capital imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of **its political subdivisions or local authorities**, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied."

**Key Points**:
- DTAs cover taxes at **all levels** of government (federal, state, local)
- Applies regardless of collection method
- Covers "political subdivisions" (states, provinces, regions)
- Covers "local authorities" (municipalities, counties)

### Treatment Varies by Country

| Country | Treaty Treatment of Subnational Taxes |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| **Most countries** | Subnational income taxes covered by DTA |
| **United States** | State/local taxes generally **excluded** (except non-discrimination) |
| **Switzerland** | Cantonal taxes covered |
| **Germany** | State share of taxes covered |

### U.S. Model Convention Approach

The U.S. Model Tax Convention takes a unique position:

> "Except with respect to Article 24 (Nondiscrimination), state and local taxes in the United States are not covered by the Convention."

**Implications**:
- State income taxes are NOT reduced by U.S. DTAs
- Non-residents may face both federal AND state tax
- Non-discrimination protection still applies at state level
- Creates complexity for international taxpayers

---

## C. INTERNATIONAL TAX IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Multiple Layers of Double Taxation

In federal systems, international taxpayers may face:

```
Example: Non-resident earning income in USA

Federal Level:
• U.S. federal income tax (potentially reduced by DTA)

State Level:
• State income tax (NOT covered by DTA)
• Rates: 0% to 13.3%

Result: Even with DTA relief, state tax may still apply
```

### 2. Residence Determination Complexity

Different government levels may have different residence rules:

| Level | Residence Test | Issue |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Federal | 183-day rule, green card | National standard |
| State | Varies widely | Domicile, statutory residence, source rules |
| Local | Physical presence | May trigger local tax |

### 3. Compliance Burden

Federal systems create additional compliance requirements:

| Compliance Area | Challenge |
|----------------|-----------|
| Filing requirements | Multiple returns at different levels |
| Tax rates | Must track rates for each jurisdiction |
| Tax base | May differ between federal and state |
| Credits/deductions | May not align across levels |
| Withholding | May be required at multiple levels |

### 4. Transfer Pricing

Subnational transfer pricing issues arise when:
- States have their own transfer pricing rules
- Arm's length requirement applies at state level
- State may not follow federal adjustments

---

## D. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### For Individual Taxpayers

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| **Residence changes** | May trigger state exit taxes |
| **Multi-state income** | Apportionment rules vary |
| **Credits for taxes paid** | State may credit other state taxes |
| **Treaty benefits** | May not apply to state/local taxes |

### For Corporate Taxpayers

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| **Nexus rules** | Each state has different thresholds |
| **Apportionment formulas** | Sales, payroll, property factors |
| **Unitary taxation** | Some states tax worldwide combined income |
| **Permanent establishment** | State rules may differ from federal |

### For Tax Authorities

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| **Information exchange** | May not cover subnational taxes |
| **Administrative assistance** | Limited to treaty-covered taxes |
| **Competent authority** | Usually federal-level only |

---

## E. QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

### Government Levels and Tax Authority

| Level | Typical Taxes | Treaty Coverage |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Central/Federal** | Income tax, corporate tax, VAT | Always covered |
| **State/Regional** | Income tax, sales tax | Usually covered (except U.S.) |
| **Local/Municipal** | Property tax, local income | Usually covered (except U.S.) |

### Key Federal Countries Tax Structure

| Country | Federal Income Tax | State/Provincial Income Tax | Local Income Tax |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **USA** | Yes (IRS) | 41 states | 16 states allow |
| **Canada** | Yes (CRA) | Yes (all provinces) | Limited |
| **Germany** | Yes (shared) | Yes (shared) | Trade tax |
| **Switzerland** | Yes (limited) | Yes (primary) | Yes (primary) |
| **Australia** | Yes (ATO) | No | No |
| **India** | Yes (central) | Limited | Limited |

### Treaty Article 2(3) - Typical Listed Taxes

## G. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FEDERAL SYSTEMS AND LOCAL-LEVEL TAXES - ESSENTIALS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. FEDERAL vs. UNITARY: Federal systems (USA, Canada, Germany)
   have multiple taxing authorities; unitary systems (UK, France)
   concentrate power at central level

2. OECD DATA: Federal countries: 53% central, 18% state, 8% local
   Unitary countries: 65% central, 10% local

3. ARTICLE 2(1) OECD MTC: Treaties cover taxes at ALL levels -
   "political subdivisions or local authorities"

4. U.S. EXCEPTION: U.S. DTAs generally EXCLUDE state/local taxes
   (except non-discrimination) - unique approach

5. COMPLIANCE BURDEN: Federal systems create multiple filing
   requirements, varying rates, and different tax bases

6. FISCAL FEDERALISM: Theory suggests mobile tax bases
   (capital) should be taxed federally; immobile bases
   (property) should be taxed locally

7. EXAM APPLICATION: Not directly tested, but understanding
   helps with Article 2 analysis and real-world application
