## 1. Jurisdiction to Tax

### 1.1. What is Tax Jurisdiction?

Tax jurisdiction is a state's legal authority to impose and collect taxes. This authority derives from fiscal sovereignty—the inherent power of every sovereign state to determine its own tax system. States have broad autonomy to design tax systems, but this power is not unlimited; both domestic law and public international law impose constraints.

The concept is rooted in principles of state sovereignty that emerged from the Peace of Westphalia (1648). Under this framework, each state exercises supreme authority within its territorial boundaries. Sovereignty extends to the power to tax, which is a core attribute of statehood. However, while states are sovereign and equal under international law, their tax claims often overlap, creating double taxation. No supranational authority exists to resolve these conflicts definitively, so states must cooperate through bilateral treaties and multilateral conventions.

### 1.2. Bases of Tax Jurisdiction

States assert tax jurisdiction based on two fundamental connecting factors:

| Basis | Connection | Typical Scope |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Residence** | Between the state and the person earning income | Worldwide income of residents |
| **Source** | Between the state and the activity generating income | Income arising within territory only |

Most states use both residence and source jurisdiction simultaneously. A UK resident earning US dividends faces UK tax on a residence basis plus US withholding tax on a source basis—resulting in double taxation.

#### 1.2.1. Connecting Factors for Individuals

States use various connecting factors to establish jurisdiction over individuals:
- **Residence**: Physical presence, days spent in country
- **Domicile**: Permanent home, settled intention
- **Citizenship/Nationality**: Legal status (the US and Eritrea tax citizens worldwide)

#### 1.2.2. Connecting Factors for Companies

Corporate tax jurisdiction typically depends on:
- **Place of incorporation**: Where the entity is legally formed
- **Place of effective management (POEM)**: Where key decisions are made
- **Registered office**: Formal headquarters location

Different states define these terms differently under domestic law, creating overlap and conflict.

### 1.3. Double Taxation

Double taxation arises when two or more states claim tax jurisdiction over the same income. This phenomenon represents the central problem of international taxation—legitimate tax claims by multiple states resulting in the same income being taxed more than once. Three types of conflict occur:

1. **Residence-Residence Conflict**: Two states both claim a person as resident (e.g., a company incorporated in Country A but managed from Country B)

2. **Residence-Source Conflict**: The residence state taxes worldwide income while the source state taxes income arising there (e.g., a UK resident earning German employment income)

3. **Source-Source Conflict**: Two states both claim income as "sourced" in their territory (e.g., services performed partly in both countries)

Tax treaties exist to allocate taxing rights and prevent or relieve double taxation. The consequences of unrelieved double taxation include increased costs of capital for international investments, competitive distortions between businesses from countries with extensive treaty networks and those without, and barriers to labour mobility for workers accepting international assignments.

### 1.4. Public International Law Limits

#### 1.4.1. The Nexus Requirement

Public international law requires a genuine connection (nexus) between the taxing state and the taxpayer or taxable event. A state cannot tax a person or transaction with which it has no connection whatsoever. This reflects the reality that taxation implies a reciprocal relationship: the state provides benefits and in return claims a share of income.

#### 1.4.2. Types of Jurisdiction

International law distinguishes three types of state jurisdiction:

| Type | Definition | Tax Relevance |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Prescriptive** | Power to make laws | Domestic tax legislation |
| **Enforcement** | Power to compel compliance | Tax collection, audits, penalties |
| **Adjudicative** | Power to apply laws through courts | Tax tribunals, judicial review |

A state's enforcement jurisdiction is strictly territorial. A state cannot conduct enforcement activities on foreign territory, compel foreign persons to comply outside its borders, or seize assets located in another state.

### 1.5. The Revenue Rule

The revenue rule provides that courts of one state will not enforce the tax claims of another state. The leading case is *Government of India v. Taylor* [1955] AC 491, where the House of Lords held that foreign tax claims are non-justiciable in England because tax liability is imposed by sovereign authority, not contract.

The rationale includes: sovereignty concerns (enforcing another state's tax law is an act of that state's sovereignty on foreign territory); public policy (states historically unwilling to assist rival governments); and complexity (foreign courts ill-equipped to apply another state's tax law).

### 1.6. Cross-Border Enforcement

#### 1.6.1. Article 27 OECD MTC

Article 27 of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides a treaty-based exception to the revenue rule. Contracting States must lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. Under the equivalence principle, the requested state treats foreign tax debts as if they were its own domestic claims. *(covered in June 2025)*

The article's scope is broad: it applies to all taxes (not just those covered by the treaty) and can assist with collection from third parties.

#### 1.6.2. Multilateral Instruments

Beyond bilateral treaties, the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MCMAATM), with over 150 signatories, creates a comprehensive framework for mutual assistance covering exchange of information, assistance in collection, and service of documents. Within the EU, Directive 2010/24/EU mandates mutual assistance for recovery of tax claims between member states.

The distinction between information exchange (Article 26) and enforcement assistance (Article 27) is important: states willing to share tax information may be unwilling to act as debt collectors for foreign governments. Understanding which mechanism applies is essential when advising on cross-border tax disputes.
