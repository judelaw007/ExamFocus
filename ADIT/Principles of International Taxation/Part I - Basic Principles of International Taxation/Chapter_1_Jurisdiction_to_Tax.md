## 1. Concept Foundation

### 1.1. What is Tax Jurisdiction?

**Tax jurisdiction** is a state's legal authority to impose and collect taxes. This authority derives from **fiscal sovereignty** - the inherent power of every sovereign state to determine its own tax system.

**Key Principle**: States have broad autonomy to design tax systems, but this power is not unlimited. Both domestic law and international law impose constraints.

#### Theoretical Foundations of Tax Jurisdiction

The concept of tax jurisdiction is rooted in fundamental principles of state sovereignty that emerged from the Peace of Westphalia (1648). Under Westphalian sovereignty, each state exercises supreme authority within its territorial boundaries, free from external interference. This sovereignty extends to the power to tax - a core attribute of statehood.

**Three Perspectives on Tax Jurisdiction**:

| Perspective | Key Argument | Implications |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Territorialist** | States should only tax activities within their borders | Favours pure source-based taxation |
| **Universalist** | States may tax based on any genuine connection | Supports residence and citizenship taxation |
| **Functionalist** | Tax jurisdiction should align with economic substance | Underpins BEPS reforms and Pillar One |

The tension between these perspectives explains many international tax disputes. A territorialist view would limit taxation to physical presence, while universalist views permit worldwide taxation of residents. Modern international tax law has evolved towards a compromise - residence states tax worldwide income but provide relief for source-state taxation.

**The Foundational Paradox**: While states are sovereign and equal under international law, their tax claims often overlap, creating double taxation. No supranational authority exists to resolve these conflicts definitively. Instead, states must cooperate through bilateral treaties and multilateral conventions - a voluntary limitation of sovereignty in pursuit of mutual benefit.

### 1.2. The Two Primary Bases of Tax Jurisdiction

States assert tax jurisdiction based on two fundamental connecting factors:

| Basis | What It Means | Typical Scope | Examples |
|-------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Residence** | Connection between the state and the **person** earning income | Worldwide income of residents | UK taxes residents on global income |
| **Source** | Connection between the state and the **activity** generating income | Income arising within territory only | Country X taxes dividends paid by its companies |

**Exam Tip**: Most states use BOTH residence and source jurisdiction simultaneously. A UK resident earning US dividends faces: UK tax (residence basis) + US withholding tax (source basis) = double taxation.

### 1.3. Connecting Factors in Detail

States use various **connecting factors** (nexus tests) to establish jurisdiction:

#### For Individuals:
- **Residence** - Physical presence, days spent in country
- **Domicile** - Permanent home, settled intention
- **Citizenship/Nationality** - Legal status (US and Eritrea tax citizens worldwide)

#### For Companies:
- **Place of incorporation** - Where legally formed
- **Place of effective management (POEM)** - Where key decisions made
- **Registered office** - Formal headquarters location

#### For Income:
- **Situs** - Physical location of asset (real property)
- **Source** - Where economic activity occurs

**Important**: Different states define these terms differently under domestic law. This creates overlap and conflict - the foundation of double taxation.

### 1.4. Why Double Taxation Occurs

Double taxation arises when **two or more states claim tax jurisdiction over the same income**.

**Three Types of Conflict**:

1. **Residence-Residence Conflict**: Two states both claim a person as resident
   - *Example*: Individual incorporated in Country A, managed from Country B

2. **Residence-Source Conflict**: Residence state taxes worldwide; source state taxes income arising there
   - *Example*: UK resident earns German employment income

3. **Source-Source Conflict**: Two states both claim income "sourced" in their territory
   - *Example*: Service performed partly in both countries

**This is why tax treaties exist** - to allocate taxing rights and prevent/relieve double taxation.

#### The Economic Burden of Double Taxation

The consequences of unrelieved double taxation extend beyond mere inconvenience:

**Impact on Cross-Border Investment**: Studies consistently show that double taxation increases the effective cost of capital for international investments. The OECD estimates that double taxation can add 5-15 percentage points to effective tax rates, discouraging foreign direct investment and distorting capital allocation.

**Competitive Distortions**: Businesses from countries with extensive treaty networks gain competitive advantages over those from countries with limited treaty coverage. This creates pressure for treaty proliferation but also for treaty shopping and aggressive tax planning.

**Impact on Labour Mobility**: Individual workers face double taxation on employment income when working across borders. Without treaty relief, skilled professionals may avoid international assignments, hindering knowledge transfer and economic development.

**The Policy Response**: Recognising these harms, the international community has developed a sophisticated network of over 3,000 bilateral tax treaties, supplemented by multilateral instruments like the Multilateral Instrument (MLI). This network, while imperfect, has substantially reduced (though not eliminated) international double taxation.

## 2. Public International Law Limits on Tax Jurisdiction

### 2.1. The Nexus Requirement

Public international law requires a **genuine connection (nexus)** between the taxing state and the taxpayer or taxable event.

**Key Principle**: A state cannot tax a person or transaction with which it has no connection whatsoever. There must be some link justifying the assertion of tax authority.

The nexus requirement has been recognized by courts worldwide:
- A state's fiscal sovereignty is limited by public international law rules of jurisdiction
- Unlimited jurisdiction would destabilize the international legal order based on state sovereignty

**Exam Application**: If an exam scenario involves a taxpayer with NO connection to a state, question whether that state has valid jurisdiction to tax at all.

### 2.2. Types of Jurisdiction in International Law

International law distinguishes three types of state jurisdiction:

| Type | Definition | Tax Relevance |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Prescriptive** (Legislative) | Power to make laws | Domestic tax legislation |
| **Enforcement** | Power to compel compliance | Tax collection, audits, penalties |
| **Adjudicative** | Power to apply laws through courts | Tax tribunals, judicial review |

**Critical Limitation**: A state's **enforcement jurisdiction** is strictly territorial. A state CANNOT:
- Conduct enforcement activities on foreign territory
- Compel foreign persons to comply with its tax laws outside its borders
- Seize assets located in another state

This limitation creates the problem addressed by Article 27 (assistance in collection).

### 2.3. The Sovereignty Principle

Each sovereign state has:
- **Full authority** within its territory
- **No authority** to act within another state's territory
- **Independence** from other states' attempts to enforce laws

**Practical Implication**: If a taxpayer has assets abroad, the tax authority cannot simply seize them. It must either:
1. Obtain the taxpayer's voluntary compliance
2. Request assistance from the foreign state through international cooperation mechanisms

---

## 3. The Revenue Rule and Cross-Border Enforcement

### 3.1. The Revenue Rule Explained

**The Revenue Rule** (also called "Rule 3" from Dicey & Morris): Courts of one state will NOT enforce the tax claims of another state.

**Leading Case**: ***Government of India v. Taylor*** [1955] AC 491 (House of Lords)

**Facts**:
- Delhi Electric Supply Co. was a UK-incorporated company operating in India
- Company sold its Indian business in 1947, remitted proceeds to UK
- Indian government claimed capital gains tax on the sale
- Company went into voluntary liquidation in UK
- India tried to claim as creditor in the UK liquidation

**Held**:
- Foreign tax claims are **non-justiciable** in England
- Tax liability is imposed by sovereign authority, not contract
- One state's sovereign authority cannot be enforced in another state's courts
- India's claim was rejected

**The Rule Today**: *Government of India v. Taylor* remains good law and forms the basis of the revenue rule worldwide.

#### Comparative Analysis: The Revenue Rule Across Jurisdictions

The revenue rule, while originating in English common law, has been adopted with variations across legal systems:

**Common Law Jurisdictions**:
- **United States**: Consistently applied since *Moore v. Mitchell* (1929). U.S. courts refuse to enforce foreign tax judgments as a matter of judicial policy.
- **Canada**: Follows the revenue rule but has modified it through treaty-based cooperation (extensive Article 27 network).
- **Ireland**: Applied in *Peter Buchanan Ltd v. McVey* [1954] IR 89 - foreign revenue claims are unenforceable absent treaty obligation.

**Civil Law Jurisdictions**:
- **Germany**: Historically applied a similar principle, but EU harmonisation has created exceptions for intra-EU claims.
- **France**: Courts distinguish between enforcement of tax judgments (refused) and recognition of tax debts as facts (permitted in some contexts).

**Emerging Challenges to the Rule**:

The traditional revenue rule is increasingly viewed as anachronistic in a globalised economy. Several factors are eroding its strict application:

1. **Treaty networks**: Bilateral treaties with Article 27 provisions create binding obligations to assist in collection.
2. **Multilateral instruments**: The MCMAATM (151 signatories) creates a comprehensive framework for mutual assistance.
3. **EU harmonisation**: The EU Recovery Directive (2010/24/EU) mandates mutual assistance between member states.
4. **Automatic exchange regimes**: CRS and FATCA create information flows that facilitate voluntary compliance.

Despite these developments, the core principle remains: absent a specific legal obligation (treaty or directive), courts will not enforce foreign tax claims. This creates ongoing tension between the principle of fiscal sovereignty and the practical need for cross-border tax cooperation.

### 3.2. Why the Revenue Rule Exists

**Rationale**:
1. **Sovereignty**: Enforcing another state's tax law is an act of that state's sovereignty on foreign territory
2. **Public policy**: States historically unwilling to assist rival governments collect revenue
3. **Complexity**: Foreign courts ill-equipped to interpret and apply another state's tax law
4. **Precedent**: Long-standing common law principle across jurisdictions

### 3.3. Consequences of the Revenue Rule

Without cooperation mechanisms, tax authorities face serious limitations:
- Cannot pursue taxpayers who move assets abroad
- Cannot collect debts from non-resident taxpayers
- Tax evasion facilitated by cross-border asset movement
- Competitive disadvantage for honest taxpayers

**This is why Article 27 and other assistance mechanisms were developed.**

---

## 4. Overcoming the Revenue Rule: Assistance in Collection

### 4.1. Article 27 OECD Model Tax Convention

**Article 27** ("Assistance in the Collection of Taxes") provides a treaty-based exception to the revenue rule.

**Key Provisions**:

> "The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims."

**Scope** (Article 27(1)):
- Not restricted by Articles 1 (persons covered) or 2 (taxes covered)
- Applies to ALL taxes, not just those covered by the treaty
- Can assist with collection from third parties (not just treaty residents)

**What Qualifies as a "Revenue Claim"** (Article 27(2)):
- An amount owed in respect of taxes
- Interest, administrative penalties, and costs of collection
- Must be a claim that is **enforceable** under the laws of the requesting state

### 4.2. The Equivalence Principle

**Key Mechanism** (Article 27(3)):

When a requested state receives a valid assistance request, it must treat the foreign revenue claim **as if it were its own tax claim**.

- Use same enforcement powers as for domestic taxes
- Same priority in bankruptcy/insolvency proceedings
- Same limitation periods for collection

**Important Limitation**: The requested state is NOT required to:
- Use enforcement measures it wouldn't use for its own claims
- Grant the foreign claim higher priority than its own tax claims
- Take measures contrary to its public policy

### 4.3. Temporal Scope of Article 27

**Exam Focus - June 2025 Q1 tested this directly**:

Does Article 27 have unlimited temporal reach?

**Analysis**:
- Article 27 contains **no express limitation period** for assistance requests
- The Commentary states assistance may be provided for claims arising before treaty entered into force
- HOWEVER, the requesting state must show the claim was enforceable when request made
- The requested state applies ITS OWN limitation periods (equivalence principle)

**Practical Result**: Not truly "unlimited" - subject to:
1. The claim being enforceable in the requesting state
2. Limitation periods of the requested state
3. Public policy exceptions

### 4.4. Other Assistance Mechanisms

**The Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MCMAATM)**:
- Developed by OECD and Council of Europe (1988, amended 2010)
- 151 signatories as of 2025
- Covers:
  - Exchange of information
  - Assistance in collection
  - Service of documents
- Broader than bilateral treaties - creates multilateral network

**EU Directive 2010/24/EU**:
- Mutual assistance for recovery of tax claims within EU
- Covers all taxes (not just income tax)
- Uniform instrument for enforcement across member states

### 4.5. Distinction: Information vs. Enforcement

**Important**: Gathering information is NOT the same as enforcing revenue claims.

- *Jimenez v. HMRC*: Requesting information from abroad does not violate the revenue rule
- Article 26 (exchange of information) is separate from Article 27 (assistance in collection)
- A state can share tax information without helping collect another state's taxes

## 5. The Saving Clause: Preserving Domestic Taxing Rights

### 5.1. What is the Saving Clause?

**Article 1(3) OECD MTC** (added 2017):

> "This Convention shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents..."

The saving clause **preserves** each state's right to tax its own residents/citizens under domestic law, **notwithstanding** treaty provisions that might otherwise limit this.

### 5.2. Purpose of the Saving Clause

**Why Needed**:
- Treaties typically restrict source state taxation
- Without a saving clause, residents might claim treaty benefits to avoid domestic tax
- The saving clause ensures treaties don't undermine residence-based taxation

**Example (US Treaties)**:
- US citizen living in France earns French employment income
- France-US treaty allocates taxing rights to France (source)
- WITHOUT saving clause: US might be prevented from taxing its citizen
- WITH saving clause: US retains right to tax its citizen's worldwide income

### 5.3. Exceptions to the Saving Clause

Article 1(3) lists exceptions where the saving clause does NOT apply:
- Benefits granted by the residence state under Articles 6-22 (substantive rules)
- Treaty provisions specifically designed to benefit residents (e.g., pension articles)
- Non-discrimination provisions
- MAP and arbitration procedures

**Exam Application**: When analyzing treaty benefits for residents, check whether the saving clause overrides the benefit.

### 5.4. The Saving Clause in Different Treaty Models

Different model conventions and bilateral treaties take varying approaches to the saving clause:

| Model/Treaty | Saving Clause Approach | Notable Features |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **OECD MTC** | Article 1(3) - added 2017 | Standard formulation with listed exceptions |
| **UN Model** | Similar to OECD | More limited exceptions |
| **US Model** | More extensive | Explicitly covers citizens AND residents |
| **UK Treaties** | Varies | Some older treaties lack saving clause |

**The US Approach - A Case Study**:

The United States applies citizenship-based taxation - one of only two countries (alongside Eritrea) to tax citizens on worldwide income regardless of residence. This makes the saving clause particularly important in US treaties.

*Example*: Under the US-UK DTC:
- A US citizen residing in the UK earns UK employment income
- Article 14 allocates primary taxing right to UK (source/residence)
- The saving clause preserves US right to tax its citizen
- Result: US citizen still liable to US tax, but receives foreign tax credit

This approach means US citizens abroad face permanent double filing obligations, though the foreign tax credit and foreign earned income exclusion provide relief in most cases.

**Policy Debate**: The saving clause represents a fundamental choice between:
1. **Treaty primacy**: Treaties should fully resolve double taxation by limiting both states' claims
2. **Fiscal sovereignty**: States should retain the right to tax their own residents/citizens

The prevailing approach (saving clause included) favours fiscal sovereignty, ensuring treaties allocate taxing rights between states without compromising either state's ability to tax persons with the closest connection to it.

```

---

**Model Answer**:

**Introduction**

The statement raises the important question of Article 27's temporal scope in overcoming the traditional "revenue rule." To evaluate this claim, we must first understand why assistance in collection is needed and then examine whether Article 27's reach is truly "unlimited."

**The Revenue Rule and Need for Article 27**

Traditionally, under the "revenue rule" established in *Government of India v. Taylor* [1955], courts of one state will not enforce the tax claims of another state. This principle reflects state sovereignty - tax obligations are imposed by sovereign authority and cannot be enforced extraterritorially.

Article 27, introduced to the OECD MTC in 2003 and to the UN Model in 2011, provides a treaty-based exception. It requires Contracting States to "lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims," treating foreign tax debts as if they were domestic claims (the "equivalence principle").

**Arguments Supporting "Unlimited Temporal Reach"**

Several aspects of Article 27 support broad temporal application:

First, Article 27 contains **no express limitation period** specifying when claims must have arisen. Unlike some treaty provisions with temporal limitations, Article 27 is silent on timing.

Second, paragraph 11 of the Commentary states that "assistance may be provided in respect of revenue claims that have arisen before the Convention has entered into force." This confirms backward-looking application.

Third, Article 27(1) states the article is "not restricted by Articles 1 and 2," broadening its scope beyond the treaty's normal personal and material scope.

Fourth, the equivalence principle in Article 27(3) means the requested state must treat claims "as if it were an amount of tax owed to that State" - suggesting full enforcement powers without temporal qualification.

**Arguments Against Truly "Unlimited" Reach**

However, several factors constrain Article 27's temporal scope:

**Enforceability requirement**: Article 27(2) requires the revenue claim to be "enforceable under the laws of the applicant State." If the requesting state's own limitation period has expired, no assistance can be sought.

**Requested state's limitations**: Under the equivalence principle, the requested state applies its own procedural rules, including domestic limitation periods. Commentary paragraph 15 confirms claims may become time-barred under requested state law.

**Not retroactive in all cases**: While assistance may be provided for pre-treaty claims, the treaty must be in force when the request is made. Historical claims cannot be pursued if no treaty exists.

**Conservancy measures limitation**: Article 27(4) restricts precautionary measures (asset freezing) to claims that have been "finally determined" - creating procedural constraints.

**Public policy exception**: Article 27(8) allows refusal where assistance would be "contrary to public policy." A requested state might invoke this for very old claims raising fairness concerns.

**Conclusion**

The statement that Article 27 provides "unlimited temporal reach" is an **overstatement**. While Article 27 deliberately avoids express temporal limitations and can apply to claims arising before treaty entry into force, it is constrained by:
- The requesting state's own enforceability rules
- The requested state's limitation periods (equivalence principle)
- Practical enforceability requirements
- Public policy exceptions

The more accurate characterization is that Article 27 provides **broad** but not truly unlimited temporal scope. It removes traditional common law barriers to cross-border tax collection while remaining subject to each state's domestic procedural rules and fundamental fairness principles.

**Model Answer**:

**Introduction**

Residence is one of two fundamental bases for tax jurisdiction, alongside source. Under residence-based taxation, a state taxes the worldwide income of persons deemed resident under its domestic law. Article 4 of the OECD MTC addresses dual residence through tie-breaker rules, reflecting residence's centrality to the treaty framework. This answer considers whether residence remains a meaningful connecting factor amid modern challenges.

**Traditional Rationale for Residence-Based Taxation**

Residence has historically been favoured for several reasons:

**Benefits principle**: Residents benefit from state services (infrastructure, legal system, security) and should contribute to their cost through taxation regardless of where income is earned.

**Ability to pay**: Residence enables taxation based on overall capacity to pay, assessing worldwide income rather than fragmentary source-based assessment.

**Administrative efficiency**: The residence state has access to the taxpayer, can enforce compliance, and has information about global affairs through domestic reporting requirements.

**Treaty coherence**: The OECD MTC assumes residence-based taxation, with residence state generally bearing double taxation relief obligations. Abandoning residence would require wholesale treaty restructure.

**Challenges from Globalisation and Mobility**

The statement's concerns reflect genuine modern difficulties:

**Artificial residence manipulation**: High-net-worth individuals can choose tax residence through careful travel patterns, exploiting differences in domestic residence rules. The proliferation of "golden visa" programmes facilitates residence shopping.

**Digital nomads**: Remote workers may have genuine connections to multiple states without clear primary residence. Traditional tests (permanent home, centre of vital interests) may produce arbitrary results.

**Corporate residence uncertainty**: Place of effective management (POEM) is difficult to determine for companies with dispersed decision-making or virtual board meetings. The 2017 OECD MTC acknowledged this by moving to mutual agreement procedure for dual-resident entities.

**Erosion of residence-source allocation**: Digital business models allow revenue generation without physical presence, undermining the residence/source allocation framework treaties depend upon.

**Arguments for Retaining Residence**

Despite these challenges, strong arguments support residence's continued relevance:

**Alternatives are worse**: Source-based taxation faces even greater challenges - defining "source" for services, intangibles, and digital transactions is highly contentious. Pillar One demonstrates how difficult market/destination-based allocation is to implement.

**Workable in most cases**: For the vast majority of taxpayers (employed individuals, domestic businesses), residence is clear and uncontroversial. Hard cases at the margins should not invalidate a generally effective concept.

**Adaptable framework**: Article 4 tie-breaker rules, while imperfect, provide structured resolution for dual residence. The 2017 changes for entities show the framework can evolve.

**Global consensus**: Abandoning residence would require unprecedented international coordination. No viable alternative commands sufficient support to replace it.

**Possible Alternatives and Their Limitations**

**Citizenship-based taxation** (US model): Creates different problems - taxation without current connection, compliance burdens for expatriates, double taxation for immigrants.

**Pure source taxation**: Would require complex source rules for every income type, disadvantage capital-exporting states, and incentivise income characterisation manipulation.

**Formulary apportionment**: Requires agreement on formula factors - Pillar One negotiations show how difficult this is even for a limited scope.

**Consumption-based taxation**: Would require fundamental restructure of direct taxation, raises progressivity concerns, and faces its own cross-border challenges.

**Conclusion**

Residence for tax purposes remains an effective connecting factor despite globalisation challenges. While not perfect, it offers a workable basis for allocating taxing rights that no proposed alternative clearly improves upon. The appropriate response is adaptation - tightening anti-avoidance rules, improving tie-breaker mechanisms, and supplementing residence-based taxation with targeted source-based measures (as Pillar One attempts) - rather than abandonment.

The statement's call to "abandon" residence overstates the case. Residence should be retained as the primary jurisdiction basis while acknowledging it requires ongoing refinement for a changing global economy.

## 8. Pattern Variations

### How Examiners Vary Jurisdiction Questions

**Variation 1: Comparative Framework**
- "Compare residence and source as bases for taxation"
- Requires balanced treatment of both, with clear criteria for comparison

**Variation 2: Specific Mechanism Focus**
- "Explain how Article 4 tie-breaker rules resolve dual residence"
- More technical, requires step-by-step sequential analysis

**Variation 3: Policy Evaluation**
- "Should developing countries prioritise source taxation?"
- Requires understanding of developed/developing country perspectives

**Variation 4: Historical Development**
- "Trace the evolution of assistance in tax collection"
- Requires knowledge of revenue rule, bilateral treaties, MCMAATM

**Variation 5: Scenario Application**
- "Advise Country X on whether it can collect tax from Mr Y who has moved to Country Z"
- Apply principles to facts: jurisdiction basis → revenue rule → treaty provisions

### Adaptation Strategies

| Variation | Key Adaptation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Comparative | Use structured comparison table, balanced treatment |
| Mechanism | Step-by-step explanation, cite specific treaty articles |
| Policy | Consider different state perspectives, pros and cons |
| Historical | Chronological structure, key dates and developments |
| Scenario | State principle → Apply to facts → Conclude |

## 9. Error Prevention

### Top 10 Candidate Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Prevention | Marks at Risk |
|---|---------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Confusing residence and source jurisdictions | Define both clearly at outset | 3-4 |
| 2 | Forgetting the revenue rule exists | Always mention *Government of India v. Taylor* for enforcement questions | 4-5 |
| 3 | Mixing up Article 26 (information) and Article 27 (collection) | Note: 26 = information, 27 = collection | 3-4 |

## 10. Bilateral vs. Multilateral Approaches to Jurisdiction

### The Evolution from Bilateral to Multilateral Solutions

Historically, international tax cooperation has relied on bilateral treaties. This approach has both strengths and limitations:

**Advantages of Bilateral Approach**:
- Tailored to specific country relationships and circumstances
- Easier to negotiate between two parties
- Allows for differentiated treatment based on economic ties
- Flexibility to address unique situations

**Limitations of Bilateral Approach**:
- Creates inconsistent network with over 3,000 different treaties
- Difficult to update - each treaty requires separate renegotiation
- Gaps in coverage where no treaty exists
- Susceptible to treaty shopping through third countries

**The Rise of Multilateral Instruments**:

The limitations of bilateralism have driven the development of multilateral solutions:

| Instrument | Purpose | Coverage |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **MCMAATM (1988/2010)** | Administrative assistance including collection | 151 jurisdictions |
| **MLI (2017)** | BEPS implementation across treaty network | 100+ jurisdictions |
| **CRS (2014)** | Automatic exchange of financial account information | 100+ jurisdictions |
| **STTR (2024)** | Subject to Tax Rule under Pillar Two | Developing countries |

**Implications for Jurisdiction Analysis**:

The shift towards multilateralism affects how jurisdiction questions should be analyzed:

1. **Check multilateral coverage**: Before concluding no cooperation mechanism exists, verify whether states are party to MCMAATM or other multilateral instruments.

2. **Treaty modification via MLI**: Many bilateral treaties have been modified by the MLI - check whether specific provisions have been affected.

3. **Automatic exchange impact**: Even without formal assistance provisions, automatic exchange may provide tax authorities with information enabling domestic enforcement.

**Exam Relevance**: Questions testing jurisdiction and enforcement should consider both bilateral treaty provisions AND multilateral instruments. A comprehensive answer demonstrates awareness of the evolving multilateral framework alongside traditional bilateral analysis.
