## A. INTRODUCTION: BEYOND CREDIT AND EXEMPTION

While the credit method and exemption method represent the primary mechanisms for eliminating double taxation under tax treaties, other approaches exist. These alternative methods play important roles in practice—sometimes as the only available relief, sometimes as fallback positions when credit or exemption conditions are not met, and sometimes as historical artifacts that continue to affect taxpayer behavior.

The two most significant alternative methods are:

1. **Relief by deduction of foreign tax**: Treating foreign tax as a deductible expense rather than a credit against tax liability
2. **Relief by deferral**: Postponing residence-state taxation until foreign income is repatriated

Understanding these methods is essential for complete mastery of the international tax relief framework. They appear regularly in exam scenarios, often as comparison points or as the applicable method when standard credit or exemption is unavailable.

## B. RELIEF BY DEDUCTION OF FOREIGN TAX

### 1. How the Deduction Method Works

Under the **deduction method**, foreign taxes paid are treated as a **deductible expense** that reduces taxable income, rather than as a **credit** that directly reduces tax liability. This seemingly technical distinction has profound practical consequences.

```
DEDUCTION VS CREDIT COMPARISON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Foreign income: €100,000
Foreign tax (25%): €25,000
Residence state rate: 35%

CREDIT METHOD:
──────────────
Residence state tax on €100,000: €35,000
Credit for foreign tax: (€25,000)
Net residence state tax: €10,000
Total tax: €25,000 + €10,000 = €35,000
Effective rate: 35%

DEDUCTION METHOD:
─────────────────
Taxable income: €100,000 - €25,000 = €75,000
Residence state tax: €75,000 × 35% = €26,250
Total tax: €25,000 + €26,250 = €51,250
Effective rate: 51.25%

DIFFERENCE:
Credit method: €35,000 total tax
Deduction method: €51,250 total tax
Additional tax under deduction: €16,250 (46% more)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The mathematical explanation is straightforward. A credit reduces tax liability on a one-for-one basis: €25,000 of foreign tax means €25,000 less residence-state tax. A deduction only reduces the taxable base: €25,000 of deduction reduces residence-state tax by €25,000 × 35% = €8,750. The credit provides relief equal to the full foreign tax (subject to limitations), while the deduction provides relief equal to only a fraction of the foreign tax—specifically, the fraction equal to the residence-state tax rate.

### 2. Why Deduction Provides Inferior Relief

The deduction method **never provides complete relief** from double taxation:

| Scenario | Credit Relief | Deduction Relief |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Foreign rate < residence rate | Full (no excess) | Partial |
| Foreign rate = residence rate | Full (exact offset) | Partial |
| Foreign rate > residence rate | Full (with excess) | Partial |

Even when foreign and residence rates are identical, the deduction method leaves the taxpayer worse off than the credit method. The only scenario where deduction would equal credit is if the residence-state rate were 100%—an impossible case.

### 3. The Policy Rationale for Deduction

Given its inferiority, why does the deduction method exist at all? Several factors explain its continued relevance:

**Historical Origins**: Before the credit method was developed and refined, treating foreign taxes as deductible expenses was the natural approach. Expenses reduce income; taxes are a cost of earning foreign income; therefore, foreign taxes should be deductible. This logic is intuitively appealing even if economically suboptimal.

**Simplicity**: The deduction method requires no special credit calculations, no foreign tax verification beyond what is needed for any expense deduction, and no limitation analysis. For taxpayers with small amounts of foreign income, the administrative simplicity may outweigh the additional tax cost.

**Fallback Position**: Many tax systems provide deduction as a fallback when credit is unavailable. If a foreign levy does not qualify as a creditable tax (perhaps because it is considered a fee or does not meet the "income tax" definition), deduction may still be available.

**Tax Planning Tool**: In some circumstances, deduction may actually be preferable to credit. If a taxpayer has excess foreign tax credits that cannot be utilized, converting some foreign taxes to deductions (where permitted) may provide more benefit than worthless excess credits.

### 4. When Deduction Applies

Common situations where deduction rather than credit is used:

| Situation | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Non-qualifying taxes** | Foreign levies that don't meet credit requirements |
| **No treaty** | Some domestic laws provide only deduction for non-treaty countries |
| **Taxpayer election** | Some systems allow choice; may benefit certain positions |
| **Limitation on credit** | Credit limited to residence-state tax; excess may be deductible |
| **Specific income types** | Some income types may qualify for deduction only |

### 5. Deduction Method Formula

For examination purposes, the deduction calculation follows this pattern:

```
DEDUCTION METHOD CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: Determine gross foreign income
        Example: €100,000

Step 2: Determine foreign tax paid
        Example: €25,000

Step 3: Calculate net taxable income
        €100,000 - €25,000 = €75,000

Step 4: Apply residence state tax rate
        €75,000 × 35% = €26,250

Step 5: Calculate total tax burden
        Foreign tax: €25,000
        Residence tax: €26,250
        Total: €51,250

Step 6: Calculate effective rate
        €51,250 / €100,000 = 51.25%

NOTE: Effective rate ALWAYS exceeds the higher of the two rates
      under the deduction method

## C. RELIEF BY DEFERRAL

### 1. Understanding Deferral

**Deferral** is not a method of eliminating double taxation in the same sense as credit or exemption. Rather, it describes a **timing feature** that affects when residence-state taxation arises on foreign income earned through certain structures.

The core principle is this: income earned by a **foreign subsidiary** is generally not taxed in the parent's residence state until it is **distributed as a dividend**. The parent company's tax is "deferred" until repatriation occurs—which may be years later or never, if profits remain permanently reinvested abroad.

```
DEFERRAL CONCEPT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YEAR 1: SubCo (Country S) earns €1,000,000
        S corporate tax: €200,000
        ParentCo (Country R) tax: €0 (no distribution)
        Profits retained in SubCo

YEAR 2: SubCo earns €1,500,000
        S corporate tax: €300,000
        ParentCo tax: €0 (still no distribution)
        Retained earnings growing

YEAR 5: SubCo distributes €3,000,000 dividend
        ParentCo recognizes income
        R tax applies (with credit or exemption)

DEFERRAL BENEFIT:
• Time value of money advantage (4 years in this example)
• Indefinite deferral possible if profits reinvested permanently
• Cash flow advantage for group
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Deferral vs Branch Taxation

The availability of deferral depends on the legal structure used for foreign operations:

| Structure | Taxation Timing | Deferral Available? |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Foreign branch** | Income taxed currently as earned | No |
| **Foreign subsidiary** | Income taxed when distributed | Yes (historically) |
| **Transparent entity** | Income flows through currently | No |
| **Hybrid entity** | Depends on residence/source classification | Variable |

This structural difference historically created strong incentives to use subsidiary rather than branch structures for foreign operations. A branch's profits are included in the parent's taxable income immediately; a subsidiary's profits can be deferred indefinitely. The tax planning implications were enormous—US multinationals famously accumulated over $2 trillion of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries to avoid US tax.

### 3. The Economic Value of Deferral

Deferral's value derives from the **time value of money**. Consider:

```
VALUE OF DEFERRAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Foreign profits: €1,000,000
Residence state tax rate: 30%
Discount rate: 5%

IMMEDIATE TAXATION (Branch):
Tax payable now: €300,000
Present value of tax: €300,000

DEFERRAL FOR 10 YEARS (Subsidiary):
Tax payable in Year 10: €300,000
Present value of tax: €300,000 / (1.05)^10 = €184,174

VALUE OF DEFERRAL:
€300,000 - €184,174 = €115,826 (39% reduction in tax cost)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If deferral is indefinite (profits never repatriated), the tax may never be paid at all—effectively converting deferral into exemption.

### 4. Limitations on Deferral: CFC Rules

The value of deferral created significant policy concerns. Countries worried that their multinationals were indefinitely deferring tax on income that should rightfully be subject to residence-state taxation. The response was **Controlled Foreign Company (CFC)** legislation:

```
CFC RULES AND DEFERRAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITHOUT CFC RULES:
SubCo income → Not taxed until distributed → Indefinite deferral

WITH CFC RULES:
SubCo income → Is it "CFC income"?
    │
    ├─No→ Deferral continues
    │
    └─Yes→ Deemed distribution to ParentCo
           → CURRENT taxation regardless of actual distribution
           → Deferral ELIMINATED for CFC income

CFC INCOME TYPICALLY INCLUDES:
• Passive income (dividends, interest, royalties)
• Income from low-tax jurisdictions
• Income from related-party transactions
• Certain service income
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

CFC rules vary significantly by country, but the common objective is to end deferral for certain "tainted" income categories while preserving it for genuine active business income.

### 5. Modern Developments: GILTI and Pillar Two

Two recent developments have further limited the value of deferral:

**US GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income)**:
The 2017 US tax reform introduced GILTI, which taxes US shareholders currently on their share of certain foreign subsidiary income, regardless of distribution. GILTI largely ended deferral for US multinationals by subjecting most foreign active income to immediate (albeit reduced-rate) taxation.

**OECD Pillar Two**:
The global minimum tax under Pillar Two operates on a similar principle. If foreign income is not taxed at the 15% minimum rate, a "top-up tax" applies in the parent's jurisdiction. This limits deferral's value because low-taxed deferred income will eventually trigger top-up taxes.

```
EVOLUTION OF DEFERRAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HISTORICAL (Pre-1960s):
• Unlimited deferral for subsidiary income
• Major incentive for foreign structures

CFC ERA (1960s-2017):
• Deferral limited for passive/tainted income
• Active business income still deferred
• Significant planning opportunities remained

POST-GILTI/PILLAR TWO (2017+):
• Deferral largely eliminated for US companies
• Pillar Two limits deferral benefits globally
• Planning focus shifts to other mechanisms

## D. COMPARISON OF ALL RELIEF METHODS

### 1. Summary Table

| Method | Mechanism | Effective Rate | Relief Quality | When Used |
|--------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Exemption** | Exclude from tax base | Source rate | Full | Primary treaty method |
| **Credit** | Deduct from tax liability | Higher of two rates | Full (within limits) | Primary treaty method |
| **Deduction** | Reduce taxable income | Very high | Partial only | Fallback/non-qualifying |
| **Deferral** | Postpone recognition | Deferred residence rate | Timing benefit | Subsidiary structures |

### 2. Numerical Comparison

```
ALL METHODS COMPARED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Foreign income: €100,000
Foreign tax rate: 25%
Residence tax rate: 35%

                        Foreign   Residence   Total    Effective

                                  (PV: €6,139)         (PV: 31.1%)

*Present value calculation assumes 5% discount rate
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Ranking of Methods (Taxpayer Perspective)

From the taxpayer's perspective, assuming the source rate is lower than the residence rate:

1. **Best**: Exemption (lowest total tax)
2. **Good**: Deferral (time value benefit)
3. **Acceptable**: Credit (eliminates double taxation)
4. **Worst**: Deduction (only partial relief)

If the source rate exceeds the residence rate, credit and deferral produce the same ultimate tax burden (the source rate), while exemption still provides the lowest tax.

## E. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLE

### Comparison of Relief Methods (12 marks)

**Scenario**:

A UK company operates in Country Z through a permanent establishment. In Year 1, the PE earns £500,000, on which Country Z levies £150,000 tax (30%). UK corporate tax rate is 25%.

**Required**:
(a) Calculate the UK company's total tax burden under credit method, deduction method, and exemption method (9 marks)
(b) Explain why the deduction method is considered inferior to the credit method (3 marks)

**Model Answer**:

**(a) Calculations (9 marks)**

**Credit Method:**
```
UK tax on PE income: £500,000 × 25% = £125,000
Foreign tax credit: (£125,000) ← limited to UK tax
Excess credit: £25,000 (carried forward)
UK tax payable: £0

Total tax: £150,000 (Country Z only)
Effective rate: 30%
```

**Deduction Method:**
```
Taxable income: £500,000 - £150,000 = £350,000
UK tax: £350,000 × 25% = £87,500

Total tax: £150,000 + £87,500 = £237,500
Effective rate: 47.5%
```

**Exemption Method:**
```
PE income exempt under treaty
UK tax: £0

Total tax: £150,000 (Country Z only)
Effective rate: 30%
```

**Summary:**

| Method | UK Tax | Z Tax | Total | Effective Rate |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Credit | £0 | £150,000 | £150,000 | 30% |
| Deduction | £87,500 | £150,000 | £237,500 | 47.5% |
| Exemption | £0 | £150,000 | £150,000 | 30% |

**(b) Why Deduction is Inferior (3 marks)**

The deduction method is inferior to the credit method because:

1. **Mechanism difference**: A credit reduces tax liability pound-for-pound; a deduction only reduces the tax base. A £150,000 credit eliminates £150,000 of UK tax (subject to limitation), while a £150,000 deduction only reduces UK tax by £150,000 × 25% = £37,500.

2. **Always results in higher total tax**: Under any combination of rates, deduction produces a higher effective rate than credit. In this example, deduction results in 47.5% effective rate versus 30% under credit—a 58% higher total tax burden.

3. **Cannot eliminate double taxation**: The credit method can fully eliminate double taxation (bringing total tax to the higher of the two rates). The deduction method always leaves some element of double taxation because the residence state still taxes a portion of income that has already borne foreign tax.

```
ESSENTIAL POINTS TO REMEMBER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. DEDUCTION METHOD:
   • Foreign tax treated as deductible expense
   • Reduces taxable income, NOT tax liability
   • Provides PARTIAL relief only
   • Effective rate always > higher of two rates
   • Used as fallback when credit unavailable

2. DEFERRAL:
   • Timing benefit, not true relief method
   • Subsidiary income not taxed until distributed
   • Time value of money advantage
   • LIMITED by CFC rules
   • FURTHER LIMITED by GILTI and Pillar Two

3. COMPARISON:
   • Exemption: Best for taxpayer (lowest tax)
   • Credit: Full relief (higher of two rates)
   • Deferral: Timing benefit (present value saving)
   • Deduction: Partial relief only (worst outcome)

4. WHEN DEDUCTION APPLIES:
   • Non-qualifying foreign taxes
   • No treaty in place
   • Excess credits that cannot be utilized
   • Taxpayer election (rare)

5. CFC RULES AND DEFERRAL:
   • CFC rules attribute passive/tainted income currently
   • Eliminates deferral for specified income
   • Active business income may still be deferred
   • GILTI (US) and Pillar Two limit remaining benefits
