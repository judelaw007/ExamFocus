## Chapter 5.5: Other Methods of Relief from International Double Taxation

### 1. Beyond Credit and Exemption

While the credit method under Article 23B and the exemption method under Article 23A represent the primary treaty-based mechanisms for eliminating international double taxation, two additional approaches warrant examination: relief by deduction of foreign tax and relief by deferral. Neither achieves complete elimination of double taxation in the manner of credit or exemption, but both play roles in the international tax landscape and appear in comprehensive discussions of relief mechanisms. *(covered in December 2022)*

Understanding these alternative methods serves two purposes. First, deduction remains relevant as a fallback when credit conditions cannot be satisfied—where foreign levies fail creditability tests or where no treaty exists to provide credit relief. Second, deferral, though increasingly constrained by anti-avoidance legislation, explains historical structural choices by multinational enterprises and remains conceptually important for understanding modern controlled foreign company rules and the policy motivations underlying them.

### 2. Relief by Deduction of Foreign Tax

#### 2.1. How the Deduction Method Works

Under the deduction method, foreign taxes paid are treated as a deductible business expense reducing taxable income rather than as a credit reducing tax liability directly. This seemingly technical distinction produces fundamentally different outcomes.

A credit operates pound-for-pound against tax liability. If a taxpayer pays €25,000 in foreign tax and claims credit, residence-state tax reduces by €25,000. The credit directly offsets the residence-state obligation.

A deduction operates against taxable income. If a taxpayer deducts €25,000 in foreign tax, taxable income reduces by €25,000. The tax saving equals €25,000 multiplied by the residence-state rate. At a 30% residence rate, the deduction saves €7,500—substantially less than the €25,000 credit would provide.

This difference means deduction provides only partial relief from double taxation. The taxpayer bears both the full foreign tax burden and a residence-state burden reduced only proportionally to its marginal rate.

#### 2.2. Why Deduction Provides Only Partial Relief

The mathematical relationship between deduction and effective tax rates demonstrates why deduction can never provide complete relief. Under deduction, the effective combined rate on foreign income follows a formula: source rate plus the product of one minus the source rate and the residence rate.

Consider a taxpayer earning €100,000 in a source country with a 25% rate while resident in a country with a 35% rate. Under the credit method, the taxpayer pays €25,000 to the source country and €10,000 to the residence country (€35,000 gross tax less €25,000 credit), producing a total of €35,000 and an effective rate of 35%—the higher of the two rates.

Under the deduction method, the taxpayer pays €25,000 to the source country. The residence country taxes €75,000 (€100,000 less the €25,000 deduction) at 35%, producing €26,250. Total tax reaches €51,250, an effective rate of 51.25%—substantially exceeding both individual country rates.

The formula confirms this result: 25% plus 75% multiplied by 35% equals 51.25%. This effective rate will always exceed the higher of the two individual rates unless the residence rate reaches 100%, an impossibility in practice. Even when the source rate exceeds the residence rate, deduction produces a combined rate exceeding both individual rates.

This mathematical reality explains why deduction is universally considered inferior to credit. Double taxation is not eliminated but merely reduced. The taxpayer remains overtaxed relative to what either jurisdiction alone would impose.

#### 2.3. When Deduction Applies

Despite its inferiority, deduction persists as a fallback mechanism for situations where credit is unavailable.

Non-qualifying foreign taxes represent the most common scenario. When a foreign levy does not meet the creditability requirements—perhaps because it applies to gross receipts rather than net income, or operates as a turnover tax rather than an income tax—credit cannot apply. Digital services taxes introduced by various countries frequently fail creditability tests, leaving deduction as the only available relief. Some relief, even partial, is preferable to no relief at all.

Absence of treaty relationships creates another context for deduction. Some domestic systems provide credit only where a treaty exists or where specific legislation extends credit unilaterally. Without such provisions, taxpayers may still deduct foreign taxes as business expenses incurred in earning foreign income.

Excess foreign tax credits that cannot be utilised may in some jurisdictions be converted to deductions. When credit limitations prevent full use of foreign tax paid and carryforward provisions are exhausted or unavailable, deduction of the excess portion provides partial recovery.

Taxpayer elections exist in some systems. The United States, for example, allows taxpayers to choose between credit and deduction for foreign taxes. While credit is almost always preferable, specific circumstances involving losses or other planning considerations may favour deduction.

Administrative simplicity also plays a role. For small amounts of foreign tax, the compliance burden of calculating credit limitations, tracking carryforwards, and maintaining documentation may exceed the benefit. Simple deduction of the amount as an expense may prove more practical.

### 3. Relief by Deferral

#### 3.1. Understanding Deferral

Deferral describes a timing feature rather than a relief method in the same sense as credit or exemption. It refers to the principle that income earned by a foreign subsidiary is not taxed in the parent's residence state until distributed as a dividend. This contrasts with foreign branch income, which the residence state typically taxes currently as earned.

The distinction arises from entity recognition. A branch is not a separate legal person from its head office; branch income is the parent's income, recognised when earned. A subsidiary is a separate legal entity; its income belongs to it, not its shareholders. The parent recognises income only when the subsidiary declares and pays dividends.

This difference historically provided significant planning opportunities. By conducting foreign operations through subsidiaries rather than branches, multinational enterprises could defer residence-state taxation indefinitely—potentially forever if profits were never repatriated.

#### 3.2. Branch Versus Subsidiary Structures

The availability of deferral historically influenced structural decisions in international operations. Subsidiary structures offered deferral of residence-state tax until dividend distribution, while branch structures resulted in current taxation as income was earned.

Other considerations affect the choice between structures. Branches allow immediate utilisation of foreign losses against domestic income, potentially valuable during startup phases. Subsidiaries generally do not provide group loss relief across borders. Exit from branch operations may be simpler than liquidating or selling subsidiaries. Regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions mandate particular structures.

However, the deferral benefit often outweighed these factors, explaining the prevalence of subsidiary structures among multinational enterprises. The ability to accumulate profits abroad without residence-state taxation created substantial time-value-of-money advantages.

#### 3.3. The Economic Value of Deferral

The economic benefit of deferral lies in the time value of money. Tax deferred is worth less than tax payable currently because the taxpayer retains funds for investment during the deferral period.

Consider residence-state tax of €300,000 on foreign profits. If payable immediately, the present value equals €300,000. If deferred for ten years at a 5% discount rate, the present value falls to approximately €184,000. The difference—over €115,000—represents the deferral benefit.

Extended indefinitely, deferral approaches permanent exemption in economic effect. If profits are never repatriated, residence-state tax may never be paid. This potential for indefinite deferral made subsidiary structures particularly attractive for low-tax jurisdiction operations where the deferral benefit magnified the rate advantage.

### 4. Modern Limitations on Deferral

#### 4.1. Controlled Foreign Company Rules

Recognition that deferral facilitated profit shifting led to controlled foreign company legislation in most developed economies. These rules attribute certain categories of subsidiary income to parent companies currently, eliminating deferral for that income.

CFC rules typically require first that the foreign company be controlled by residence-state shareholders, commonly defined as more than 50% ownership. Second, the subsidiary must earn income of a type that the CFC regime targets—typically passive investment income such as dividends, interest, and royalties; income from related-party transactions; income subject to low effective taxation; or certain mobile service income.

When both conditions are met, the targeted income is attributed to the parent as a deemed distribution. The parent pays residence-state tax currently as if dividends had been received, regardless of whether actual distribution occurs. Deferral is eliminated for this income category.

CFC rules generally preserve deferral for active business income earned at arm's length and subject to appropriate taxation in the source country. The distinction reflects policy judgments about what constitutes genuine foreign business activity versus artificial arrangements designed primarily to exploit deferral.

BEPS Action 3 provided recommendations for designing effective CFC rules, establishing six building blocks: definition of controlled status, exemptions and thresholds, income categories subject to attribution, computation methods, attribution mechanisms, and provisions preventing double taxation. Nearly all OECD and G20 members have implemented CFC rules following these or similar principles. *(covered in June 2024)*

#### 4.2. GILTI and Pillar Two

The United States fundamentally restructured its approach to foreign subsidiary income in 2017 with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime taxes US shareholders currently on CFC income exceeding a deemed 10% return on tangible business assets. Unlike traditional CFC rules targeting only specific income categories, GILTI reaches most foreign income.

The effective GILTI rate through 2025 stands at 10.5%, calculated by applying the 21% corporate rate to income after a 50% deduction. This rate is scheduled to change in 2026, with recent legislation establishing a 40% deduction producing an effective rate of 12.6%. These rates, while below the standard domestic rate, substantially limit the deferral benefit previously available to US multinationals.

Pillar Two of the OECD/G20 international tax reform introduces a 15% global minimum effective tax rate on multinational enterprise profits. Where a subsidiary faces effective taxation below 15%, the Income Inclusion Rule requires the parent jurisdiction to collect top-up tax. Even where technical deferral remains available, the benefit is capped at the difference between the actual foreign rate and 15%.

The combined effect of traditional CFC rules, GILTI, and Pillar Two has largely eliminated deferral as a meaningful planning tool. Passive and related-party income faces current attribution under CFC rules. Active income faces current US taxation under GILTI or, for non-US parents, potential top-up under Pillar Two if undertaxed. The historical advantage that made subsidiary structures attractive has substantially eroded.

### 5. Comparative Assessment

Relief methods can be ranked by their effectiveness in eliminating double taxation and their attractiveness to taxpayers.

Exemption provides the most favourable treatment, taxing foreign income only at the source rate with no residence-state layer. Credit eliminates double taxation by ensuring total tax equals the higher of source and residence rates, preventing overtaxation while preserving residence-state revenue claims on the differential.

Deferral, when available, provides the same ultimate rate as credit but with time-value benefits from postponed payment. However, modern anti-avoidance frameworks have so extensively limited deferral that its practical significance has diminished substantially.

Deduction provides only partial relief, producing effective rates exceeding both source and residence rates. It serves as a fallback when other methods are unavailable rather than a preferred approach.

This hierarchy—exemption preferred, then deferral, then credit, then deduction—reflects taxpayer perspectives. From a revenue authority perspective, the ordering may differ. Credit and deduction preserve residence-state revenue claims; exemption surrenders them. Anti-deferral rules reflect residence-state determination to tax foreign income currently rather than accept indefinite postponement.

The trend in international taxation has moved toward limiting both the benefits of deferral and the circumstances in which it applies, while simultaneously expanding adoption of territorial exemption systems. This seemingly contradictory development reflects different policy responses to different concerns: exemption for genuinely-taxed active business income, combined with anti-deferral rules preventing exploitation of low-tax arrangements. The result is a more nuanced international tax landscape where structure and substance both determine ultimate tax outcomes.
