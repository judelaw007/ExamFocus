## A. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. From OEEC to OECD

Building on the League of Nations' work (Chapter 7.1), international tax coordination shifted to the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) after World War II:

| Organisation | Period | Key Features |
|--------------|--------|--------------|
| **OEEC** | 1948-1961 | European focus; Marshall Plan administration; began tax treaty work |
| **OECD** | 1961-present | Broader membership; global standard-setter; Committee on Fiscal Affairs |

The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) was established in 1961, succeeding the OEEC with expanded membership including the United States and Canada.

### 2. The Committee on Fiscal Affairs (CFA)

The **Committee on Fiscal Affairs** is the OECD body responsible for international tax matters:

**Functions:**
- Develops and updates the OECD Model Tax Convention
- Produces the Transfer Pricing Guidelines
- Leads BEPS implementation
- Coordinates the Inclusive Framework
- Issues reports on emerging tax issues

**Working methods:**
- Working Parties on specific topics (each assigned to pairs of countries)
- Public consultations on draft guidance
- Regular updates to model and guidelines
- Peer review mechanisms

### 3. The G20 Role

The **Group of Twenty (G20)** comprises major economies representing ~85% of global GDP. Its role in international tax:

- **Political mandate**: Provides high-level political support for OECD technical work
- **Legitimacy**: Includes major non-OECD economies (China, India, Brazil, etc.)
- **BEPS launch**: G20 leaders endorsed the BEPS Action Plan in 2013
- **Two-Pillar support**: G20 endorsed the Pillar One/Two framework in 2021

## B. THE OECD MODEL TAX CONVENTION

### 1. Development History

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **1963** | Draft Double Taxation Convention | First OECD Model; foundation for modern treaties |
| **1977** | First full Model Convention | Consolidated version with Commentary |
| **1992** | Looseleaf format adopted | Allows regular updates |
| **2017** | Major BEPS-driven update | Incorporated BEPS Actions 2, 6, 7, 14, 15 |
| **Ongoing** | Regular updates | 2024 update includes Amount B changes |

### 2. Structure and Components

The OECD Model Tax Convention comprises:

**The Model itself:**
- 32 Articles covering scope, definitions, distributive rules, relief methods, special provisions
- Serves as template for bilateral negotiations
- Not legally binding—a "soft law" instrument

**The Commentary:**
- Detailed interpretation guidance for each Article
- Reflects CFA's agreed understanding
- Updated regularly (sometimes more frequently than Model)
- Highly influential in treaty interpretation (see Chapter 6.3)

**Reservations and Observations:**
- **Reservations**: Member countries' positions differing from Model text
- **Observations**: Member countries' positions on Commentary interpretation

### 3. Influence and Reach

The OECD Model forms the basis for the vast majority of the 3,000+ bilateral tax treaties worldwide. However, its **developed country bias** has been criticised:

| Feature | OECD Model Tendency | Implication |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Source taxation** | Limited | Favours capital-exporting (residence) countries |
| **PE threshold** | Higher | Harder for source states to tax business profits |
| **Withholding rates** | Lower | Reduces source state revenue on passive income |

This led to the UN Model (Chapter 7.3) as an alternative with stronger source-state rights.

---

## C. THE BEPS PROJECT

### 1. Origins and Mandate (2013)

The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project emerged from:
- **Global financial crisis** (2008-2009): Increased public concern about corporate tax avoidance
- **Tax scandals**: LuxLeaks, Panama Papers, public scrutiny of MNE tax practices
- **Revenue pressures**: Governments seeking to protect tax bases
- **G20 mandate**: Political support for comprehensive action

**February 2013**: OECD published "Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting"
**July 2013**: G20 endorsed 15-point BEPS Action Plan

### 2. The 15 BEPS Actions

```
BEPS ACTION PLAN OVERVIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COHERENCE (domestic rules):
Action 2:  Neutralising hybrid mismatch arrangements
Action 3:  Strengthening CFC rules
Action 4:  Limiting interest deductions
Action 5:  Countering harmful tax practices ★ MINIMUM STANDARD

SUBSTANCE (international standards):
Action 6:  Preventing treaty abuse ★ MINIMUM STANDARD
Action 7:  Preventing artificial avoidance of PE status
Actions 8-10: Aligning transfer pricing with value creation

TRANSPARENCY:
Action 11: Measuring and monitoring BEPS
Action 12: Mandatory disclosure rules
Action 13: Transfer pricing documentation/CbCR ★ MINIMUM STANDARD
Action 14: Making dispute resolution more effective ★ MINIMUM STANDARD

IMPLEMENTATION:
Action 1:  Tax challenges of the digital economy
Action 15: Developing a multilateral instrument (MLI)

★ = Four Minimum Standards (all IF members must implement)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. The Four Minimum Standards

All Inclusive Framework members commit to implementing four minimum standards:

| Action | Focus | Key Requirements |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Action 5** | Harmful tax practices | Substantial activity; spontaneous exchange of rulings |
| **Action 6** | Treaty abuse | PPT or LOB provisions to prevent treaty shopping |
| **Action 13** | TP documentation | Three-tiered documentation; Country-by-Country Reporting |
| **Action 14** | Dispute resolution | Effective MAP; resolve cases within 24 months average |

**Peer review**: Each minimum standard is subject to peer review by the Inclusive Framework.

### 4. The Inclusive Framework

Established in 2016 to extend BEPS implementation beyond OECD/G20 members:

**Membership**: 140+ countries and jurisdictions (as of 2024)
**Structure**: All members participate on "equal footing"
**Functions**:
- Monitor and review BEPS implementation
- Conduct peer reviews of minimum standards
- Develop further guidance
- Work on Two-Pillar Solution

**Criticism**: Despite "equal footing" language, developing countries argue OECD members retain disproportionate influence over agenda and outcomes.

## D. THE MULTILATERAL INSTRUMENT (MLI)

### 1. Purpose and Mechanics

BEPS Action 15 resulted in the **Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS** (MLI), signed June 2017:

**Problem**: 3,000+ bilateral treaties would need individual renegotiation to implement BEPS changes

**Solution**: Single multilateral instrument that modifies covered bilateral treaties

**Mechanics**:
1. Countries sign MLI and list "Covered Tax Agreements" (CTAs)
2. Countries make choices on optional provisions
3. Where both treaty partners list same treaty as CTA and make compatible choices, MLI modifies that treaty
4. Provisions operate alongside (not replace) original treaty text

### 2. Key MLI Provisions

| Article | Topic | Type |
|---------|-------|------|
| Articles 3-5 | Transparent entities | Optional |
| Article 6 | Preamble language (purpose) | Minimum standard |
| Article 7 | Principal Purpose Test (PPT) | Minimum standard |
| Articles 8-11 | Dividend transfer transactions | Optional |
| Articles 12-15 | PE artificial avoidance | Optional |
| Article 16 | MAP | Minimum standard |
| Articles 18-26 | Arbitration | Optional |

### 3. Exam Application: MLI

```
EXAM FOCUS: December 2022 Q1 - MLI
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

KEY POINTS FROM EXAM SOLUTIONS:

1. LEGAL BASIS:
   • Vienna Convention Article 30(3): later treaty prevails
   • MLI coexists with, does not replace, original treaties
   • Creates "synthesised" text of covered agreements

2. MATCHING MECHANISM:
   • Both parties must list treaty as CTA
   • Both must make compatible provision choices
   • Otherwise, provision does not apply to that treaty

3. BENEFITS:
   • Speed: Modified 1,680+ treaties efficiently
   • Consistency: Uniform BEPS implementation
   • Flexibility: Countries choose which provisions to adopt

4. LIMITATIONS:
   • Complexity: Additional layer of analysis required
   • US not signatory: Major gap in coverage
   • Distributive rules not covered: Core allocation unchanged
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## E. THE TWO-PILLAR SOLUTION

### 1. From BEPS Action 1 to Pillars

BEPS Action 1 addressed the "tax challenges of the digital economy" but deferred fundamental changes. Continued work led to the **Two-Pillar Solution** agreed in October 2021:

**Context**:
- Digital business models challenge traditional nexus rules
- Highly profitable MNEs pay low effective tax rates
- Unilateral measures (DSTs) created fragmentation risk
- G20/OECD sought coordinated multilateral solution

### 2. Pillar One: Profit Reallocation

**Purpose**: Reallocate taxing rights to market jurisdictions where MNEs have customers but no physical presence

**Amount A** (for largest MNEs):
- Scope: MNEs with global revenue >€20bn and profitability >10%
- Mechanism: 25% of residual profit (above 10% margin) allocated to market jurisdictions
- Nexus: Revenue threshold in market jurisdiction
- Status: Multilateral Convention under negotiation; delayed implementation

**Amount B** (simplified TP for distributors):
- Simplified approach to baseline marketing/distribution activities
- Published February 2024; incorporated into TP Guidelines
- Particularly relevant for low-capacity countries

### 3. Pillar Two: Global Minimum Tax

**Purpose**: Ensure large MNEs pay minimum 15% effective tax rate globally

**Components**:
- **Income Inclusion Rule (IIR)**: Parent jurisdiction tops up tax on low-taxed subsidiaries
- **Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR)**: Backstop where IIR not applied
- **Subject to Tax Rule (STTR)**: Treaty-based rule for developing countries
- **Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT)**: Allows source state to collect top-up first

**Scope**: MNEs with consolidated revenue >€750m

**Implementation**: GloBE Rules published December 2021; many countries implementing from 2024

## F. TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES

### 1. Development and Status

The **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations** provide guidance on applying the arm's length principle (Article 9 OECD MTC):

| Version | Key Developments |
|---------|------------------|
| **1995** | First comprehensive Guidelines |
| **2010** | Revised Chapter I-III (comparability, methods) |
| **2017** | BEPS Actions 8-10 integrated; new Chapters VI-X |
| **2022** | Financial transactions guidance added |
| **2024** | Amount B incorporated as Annex to Chapter IV |

### 2. Legal Status

The Guidelines are **soft law**—not legally binding but highly influential:
- Incorporated by reference in many countries' domestic law
- OECD Recommendation calls on member countries to follow
- Courts frequently cite Guidelines in TP disputes
- Form basis for UN TP Manual (with developing country adaptations)

### 3. Exam Relevance

Transfer pricing questions frequently require reference to the Guidelines:
- Methods selection (CUP, resale price, cost plus, TNMM, profit split)
- Comparability analysis
- Intangibles (Chapter VI)
- Intra-group services (Chapter VII)
- Cost contribution arrangements (Chapter VIII)
- Business restructurings (Chapter IX)
- Financial transactions (Chapter X)

## Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Confusing BEPS Actions | Examiners expect precision | Memorise action numbers and content |
| Treating OECD outputs as binding law | They are soft law | Note "recommendation" status; explain influence |
| Ignoring Inclusive Framework | Key development since 2016 | Acknowledge broadened participation |
| Conflating Pillar One and Two | Different purposes and mechanisms | Pillar One = allocation; Pillar Two = minimum rate |
| Missing MLI matching requirement | Critical to understanding MLI operation | Explain both parties must list treaty and make compatible choices |
| Outdated information | Field evolves rapidly | Note dates; acknowledge ongoing developments |
