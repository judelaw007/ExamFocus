## Chapter 7.2: Work of the G20 and OECD

### 1. Institutional Framework

The modern international tax system is shaped primarily by the work of two interconnected institutions: the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty major economies. Understanding their distinct roles and how they collaborate provides essential context for the substantive rules and standards that have emerged over recent decades.

#### 1.1. From OEEC to OECD

International tax coordination shifted to the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation after World War II. Established in 1948 to administer the Marshall Plan, the OEEC began work on tax treaties as European economies integrated and cross-border investment increased. In 1961, the OEEC transformed into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with expanded membership including the United States and Canada, broadening its geographic reach beyond Europe while retaining its focus on economic policy coordination among developed economies.

The OECD's work on international taxation is conducted primarily through the Committee on Fiscal Affairs, which develops and maintains the Model Tax Convention, produces the Transfer Pricing Guidelines, leads implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, and coordinates the Inclusive Framework. The Committee operates through working parties assigned to specific topics, with pairs of member countries taking lead responsibility for different areas. Regular public consultations on draft guidance and peer review mechanisms ensure both transparency and accountability in the standard-setting process.

#### 1.2. The G20 Role

The Group of Twenty comprises major economies representing approximately 85% of global GDP, including significant non-OECD members such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia. The G20's role in international tax matters is primarily political rather than technical. G20 leaders provide high-level endorsement of initiatives developed by OECD technical experts, lending legitimacy and political momentum to proposals that might otherwise lack sufficient support for implementation.

The relationship between the OECD and G20 became particularly significant from 2013, when G20 leaders endorsed the BEPS Action Plan at their Saint Petersburg summit. This political mandate transformed what might have remained a technical exercise into a priority initiative with backing from the world's major economies. The pattern repeated in 2021 when G20 leaders endorsed the Two-Pillar framework, providing essential political support for fundamental reforms that extend well beyond the BEPS agenda.

### 2. The OECD Model Tax Convention

#### 2.1. Development History

The OECD Model Tax Convention traces its origins to 1963, when the OECD published its Draft Double Taxation Convention on Income and on Capital. This instrument drew on earlier League of Nations work but adapted it for post-war economic conditions and the needs of developed economies with significant cross-border investment flows. The 1977 revision produced the first full Model Convention with comprehensive Commentary, and the adoption of a looseleaf format in 1992 enabled regular updates without requiring complete republication.

The 2017 update represented the most significant revision in decades, incorporating changes mandated by BEPS Actions 2, 6, 7, and 14 as well as providing the framework for the Multilateral Instrument under Action 15. Subsequent updates have continued to refine provisions, with the 2024 update incorporating Amount B guidance for simplified transfer pricing of baseline distribution activities.

#### 2.2. Structure and Legal Status

The Model Tax Convention comprises 32 articles covering scope, definitions, distributive rules allocating taxing rights, methods for eliminating double taxation, and special provisions addressing non-discrimination, mutual agreement procedures, and exchange of information. The accompanying Commentary provides detailed interpretation guidance for each article, reflecting the Committee on Fiscal Affairs' agreed understanding of how provisions should be applied.

The Model is not legally binding—it represents soft law that serves as a template for bilateral negotiations. Countries may and do depart from its provisions when negotiating actual treaties, and reservations recorded by member countries indicate where they will seek different terms. Despite this non-binding status, the Model exercises enormous influence: the vast majority of the more than three thousand bilateral tax treaties in force worldwide are based substantially on its provisions, and courts regularly cite the Commentary when interpreting treaty language.

### 3. The BEPS Project

#### 3.1. Origins and Mandate

The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project emerged from a confluence of factors in the early 2010s. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 created intense pressure on government revenues while simultaneously heightening public scrutiny of corporate tax practices. High-profile media coverage of multinational enterprises with substantial economic activity but minimal tax payments generated political pressure for reform. Academic and civil society research documented the scale of profit shifting and its effects on government revenues.

In February 2013, the OECD published its report "Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting," documenting the problem and setting out a framework for response. Five months later, G20 finance ministers endorsed a fifteen-point Action Plan committing to comprehensive measures addressing the gaps and mismatches in international tax rules that enabled profit shifting. The political deadline of completing all fifteen Actions by the end of 2015 ensured rapid progress, with final reports published in October of that year.

#### 3.2. The 15 BEPS Actions

The Action Plan addressed three broad themes: coherence in domestic tax rules, substance in international standards, and transparency in tax administration.

The coherence actions addressed hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploited differences between countries' tax treatment of entities and instruments (Action 2), strengthening of controlled foreign company rules to address stateless income (Action 3), limiting base erosion through interest deductions and other financial payments (Action 4), and countering harmful tax practices including preferential regimes lacking substantial activity requirements (Action 5).

The substance actions focused on preventing treaty abuse through minimum standards and anti-abuse provisions (Action 6), preventing artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status (Action 7), and ensuring that transfer pricing outcomes align with value creation through revised guidance on intangibles, risk and capital, and high-risk transactions (Actions 8-10).

The transparency actions addressed measuring and monitoring BEPS to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures (Action 11), mandatory disclosure rules requiring taxpayers and advisors to report aggressive tax planning arrangements (Action 12), transfer pricing documentation including standardised country-by-country reporting of income, taxes, and economic activity (Action 13), and making dispute resolution mechanisms more effective to address double taxation resulting from BEPS countermeasures (Action 14).

Action 1 addressed the tax challenges of the digital economy, ultimately concluding that ring-fencing digital business was neither appropriate nor feasible, while Action 15 developed the Multilateral Instrument to implement treaty-related BEPS measures efficiently.

#### 3.3. The Four Minimum Standards

Four BEPS Actions constitute minimum standards that all Inclusive Framework members commit to implement. Action 5 requires countries to ensure that preferential regimes include substantial activity requirements and to exchange information spontaneously on taxpayer-specific rulings. Action 6 requires treaty provisions—either the principal purpose test, limitation on benefits provisions, or a combination—to address treaty shopping and other forms of treaty abuse. Action 13 requires standardised transfer pricing documentation including master file, local file, and country-by-country reports for multinational enterprises above specified revenue thresholds. Action 14 requires countries to commit to effective mutual agreement procedures with a target of resolving cases within 24 months on average.

Each minimum standard is subject to peer review, with the Inclusive Framework assessing member compliance and publishing reports identifying areas requiring improvement. This review process has driven substantial implementation progress, though compliance remains uneven across the membership.

#### 3.4. The Inclusive Framework

The Inclusive Framework on BEPS was established in 2016 to extend implementation beyond OECD and G20 members. With membership now exceeding 140 countries and jurisdictions, it represents the primary forum for international tax cooperation. All members participate on an "equal footing" in developing standards, monitoring implementation, and conducting peer reviews.

The Inclusive Framework has proven essential for legitimising BEPS outcomes and extending their reach to developing countries and smaller jurisdictions. However, criticism persists that despite the equal footing language, OECD member countries retain disproportionate influence over the agenda and outcomes through their greater technical resources, more extensive participation in working groups, and historical control over the standard-setting process. Developing countries have sought greater voice through alternative forums including the United Nations, as discussed in Chapter 7.3.

### 4. The Multilateral Instrument

BEPS Action 15 produced the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, commonly known as the Multilateral Instrument or MLI, which opened for signature in June 2017. The MLI addresses a practical problem: implementing BEPS recommendations through traditional bilateral treaty renegotiation would require thousands of separate negotiations taking decades to complete.

The MLI operates alongside existing bilateral treaties rather than replacing them. Countries signing the MLI list their Covered Tax Agreements—the bilateral treaties they wish the MLI to modify—and make choices about which optional provisions to adopt. Where both parties to a bilateral treaty have listed it as a Covered Tax Agreement and made compatible choices on a particular provision, the MLI modifies that treaty accordingly. Where choices are incompatible or one party has not listed the treaty, provisions do not apply.

This matching mechanism preserves flexibility while enabling efficient implementation. Over one hundred jurisdictions have signed the MLI, and it has modified more than 1,600 bilateral treaties. However, significant gaps remain: notably, the United States has not signed, limiting the instrument's coverage of treaties involving the world's largest economy. The MLI also addresses only treaty-related BEPS measures—it does not modify distributive rules allocating taxing rights between treaty partners, leaving the fundamental structure of bilateral treaties unchanged (covered in December 2022).

### 5. The Two-Pillar Solution

#### 5.1. Pillar One: Profit Reallocation

BEPS Action 1 identified tax challenges arising from digitalisation but deferred fundamental changes to nexus and profit allocation rules. Continued work led to the Two-Pillar Solution agreed by the Inclusive Framework in October 2021 and endorsed by G20 leaders.

Pillar One addresses the allocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions where multinational enterprises have customers but lack traditional physical presence. Amount A would reallocate a portion of residual profits from the largest and most profitable multinationals to market jurisdictions based on revenue rather than physical presence. Enterprises with global revenues exceeding twenty billion euros and profit margins above ten percent would allocate twenty-five percent of their residual profit—profit exceeding the ten percent margin—to jurisdictions where they generate revenue above specified thresholds. A multilateral convention to implement Amount A remains under negotiation, with implementation delayed beyond initial timelines.

Amount B provides a simplified approach to baseline marketing and distribution activities, offering standardised returns for routine distribution functions. Published in February 2024 and incorporated into the Transfer Pricing Guidelines, Amount B is particularly relevant for developing countries with limited capacity to conduct detailed transfer pricing analysis.

#### 5.2. Pillar Two: Global Minimum Tax

Pillar Two establishes a global minimum effective tax rate of fifteen percent for multinational enterprises with consolidated revenue exceeding 750 million euros. The Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules published in December 2021 operate through interlocking mechanisms.

The Income Inclusion Rule requires parent jurisdictions to impose top-up tax when constituent entities of a multinational group are taxed below the fifteen percent minimum in their home jurisdictions. The Undertaxed Profits Rule serves as a backstop, denying deductions or requiring equivalent adjustments where low-taxed income is not subject to IIR top-up. The Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax allows source jurisdictions to collect top-up tax themselves, ensuring that revenue flows to the jurisdiction where low-taxed activity occurs rather than to parent jurisdictions applying the IIR. The Subject to Tax Rule provides a treaty-based mechanism allowing developing countries to impose additional withholding on payments to related parties in low-tax jurisdictions.

Implementation of Pillar Two has proceeded rapidly, with major economies including the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea enacting legislation from 2024. The global minimum tax represents a fundamental departure from traditional international tax principles, introducing an element of coordination that constrains tax competition below the fifteen percent floor while preserving sovereignty above it (covered in June 2023 and June 2025).

### 6. Transfer Pricing Guidelines

The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations provide detailed guidance on applying the arm's length principle reflected in Article 9 of the Model Tax Convention. First published comprehensively in 1995, the Guidelines have been revised substantially in 2010, 2017, and 2022 to address evolving business models and implement BEPS Actions 8-10.

The Guidelines address selection of transfer pricing methods, comparability analysis, treatment of intangibles, intra-group services, cost contribution arrangements, business restructurings, and financial transactions. While not legally binding, they are incorporated by reference into many countries' domestic legislation and are regularly cited by courts and tax authorities in transfer pricing disputes. The UN Transfer Pricing Manual provides complementary guidance with particular attention to developing country perspectives, as discussed in Chapter 7.3.
