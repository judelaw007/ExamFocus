## Chapter 5.3: Practical Difficulties in Applying Relief Methods

### 1. The Gap Between Theory and Practice

The theoretical operation of relief methods appears straightforward in treaty provisions. Article 23B of the OECD Model provides that credit shall be allowed equal to the tax paid; Article 23A states that the residence state shall exempt foreign income from tax. These simple formulations mask extraordinary practical complexity when applied across more than two hundred sovereign tax jurisdictions, each maintaining different rules on timing, currency, income classification, and administrative procedure.

Understanding practical difficulties matters because these challenges determine whether relief actually achieves its purpose of eliminating double taxation. A taxpayer may be entitled to relief in principle yet find that entitlement impossible to realise due to timing mismatches, documentation requirements, or limitation structures. The gap between theoretical entitlement and practical relief represents one of the most significant sources of residual double taxation in the modern international tax system. *(covered in December 2022)*

Practical difficulties affect both the credit and exemption methods, though they manifest differently. Credit method difficulties centre on determining what qualifies for credit, applying limitation rules, and addressing timing and currency issues. Exemption method difficulties relate to calculating progression, treating foreign losses, and applying subject-to-tax conditions. Both methods share challenges around documentation, verification, and dealing with classification mismatches between jurisdictions.

### 2. Credit Method: The Creditability Question

#### 2.1. Determining Whether a Foreign Levy Qualifies

Not every payment to a foreign government qualifies for foreign tax credit. The residence state must determine whether the foreign levy constitutes an income tax entitled to relief under its domestic law and applicable treaty. This creditability determination represents one of the most contested areas in international taxation, with significant consequences for taxpayers and revenue authorities alike.

Most countries apply a multi-factor test for creditability. The first consideration is whether the levy is compulsory. Voluntary payments or contributions, even if made to a government, do not qualify for credit. The payment must be required by law rather than made by choice.

The second and most significant factor is whether the levy constitutes an income tax or its equivalent. This requires analysis of whether the tax applies to realised net gain or profit, whether the taxpayer can deduct costs and expenses in computing the tax base, and whether the calculation bears a reasonable relationship to net income rather than gross receipts. Taxes on turnover, property, or transactions generally fail this test and do not qualify for credit.

The third consideration is whether the levy is final. If the taxpayer can obtain a refund of the foreign payment, credit should only be available for the non-refundable portion. Some systems allow credit for the full amount initially, with adjustments required if refunds are subsequently claimed.

The fourth factor addresses whether the foreign tax relates to the same income being taxed by the residence state. Where the tax base differs significantly between jurisdictions, apportionment may be required to match the credit to the relevant income.

#### 2.2. Problematic Categories

Digital services taxes present significant creditability challenges. Many countries introduced these levies on gross revenues of digital businesses, typically applying to digital advertising, online marketplaces, or data monetisation activities. These taxes commonly apply to gross turnover without deduction for costs, target specific business sectors rather than income generally, and operate outside the regular corporate income tax system. Most digital services taxes fail the income tax character test and do not qualify for credit, creating potential double taxation for taxpayers operating in jurisdictions that have introduced them. *(covered in June 2025)*

Gross-basis withholding taxes create related difficulties. When withholding applies to gross payments without allowance for deductible expenses, the effective rate on net income may substantially exceed the nominal rate. A twenty-five percent withholding tax on gross royalty payments where deductible expenses represent sixty percent of gross receipts produces an effective rate on net profit exceeding sixty percent. Some countries apply reasonableness tests in such circumstances, limiting credit to what would apply if the tax were calculated on net income.

The United States Treasury's 2022 foreign tax credit regulations tightened creditability requirements significantly, introducing tests based on net gain with cost recovery, attribution requirements linking the foreign tax to the residence state's income calculation, and source requirements. These changes meant that many foreign taxes previously credited may no longer qualify, creating compliance complexity and potential unrelieved double taxation. Transitional relief through administrative notices has allowed continued reliance on prior standards in specific areas, but the regulatory framework remains more restrictive than before.

### 3. Credit Method: Limitation Structures

#### 3.1. Why Limitations Exist

Credit limitations prevent foreign taxes from reducing residence-state tax on domestic income. Without limitations, excess foreign tax could absorb not just the residence state tax attributable to foreign income but also tax on purely domestic income. This would allow foreign governments to effectively determine domestic tax burdens by setting high foreign rates.

The basic limitation formula restricts credit to the residence state's tax on the foreign income. If the foreign tax exceeds this amount, the excess cannot offset domestic-source tax liability. The taxpayer bears the excess as unrelieved double taxation—foreign tax that cannot be recovered through the credit mechanism.

#### 3.2. Types of Limitation Systems

Countries employ different limitation structures reflecting varying policy choices about how strictly to contain the credit.

Overall limitation calculates a single credit limit based on all foreign income combined. This approach permits cross-crediting, allowing excess credits from high-tax countries to offset the limitation shortfall from low-tax countries. The simplicity and flexibility of overall limitation makes it attractive, but critics argue it undermines residence-state tax on low-tax foreign income.

Per-country limitation calculates separate limits for each source country. This prevents excess credits from one country offsetting the domestic tax otherwise due on income from another country. Per-country systems are more restrictive but maintain the residence state's claim to tax low-tax foreign income at the differential rate.

Basket or category systems apply separate limits by income type, creating categories for passive income, active business income, and other classifications. This prevents mixing of income characters—ensuring, for example, that excess credits on highly-taxed active business income cannot absorb the domestic tax on lightly-taxed passive income. The United States employs a basket system with categories including general limitation income, passive income, foreign branch income, and income subject to the global intangible low-taxed income regime.

#### 3.3. Excess Credit Treatment

When foreign tax exceeds the applicable limitation, countries handle the excess differently. Many jurisdictions permit carryforward of excess credits to future years, allowing credits to be absorbed when foreign income faces lower taxation or domestic income increases the limitation ceiling. The United Kingdom permits unlimited carryforward; the United States allows ten-year carryforward. Some countries also permit carryback, allowing excess credits to recover prior-year domestic tax.

Other jurisdictions forfeit excess credits, creating permanent unrelieved double taxation. This approach maximises domestic revenue protection but disadvantages taxpayers operating in high-tax foreign jurisdictions.

Where excess credit positions persist, taxpayers may consider restructuring to use exemption-method jurisdictions for high-tax foreign operations, accelerating low-tax foreign income to absorb accumulated credits, or deferring high-tax foreign income to spread the credit burden across periods.

### 4. Credit Method: Timing and Currency Issues

#### 4.1. Different Tax Year-Ends

Source and residence states frequently use different fiscal years, creating mismatches between when income arises and when relief is available. A branch operating on an April-to-March fiscal year in the source country will have its profits split across two residence-state tax years if the parent operates on a calendar year basis.

These timing differences generate allocation questions: how to apportion branch profits between residence-state years, when to claim credit for source-country tax that straddles residence-state periods, and how to handle source-country assessments issued after residence-state filing deadlines.

Common solutions include accrual-basis treatment where credit is claimed when the liability arises rather than when paid, provisional claims based on estimates with subsequent adjustment, amended returns filed when final figures become available, and carryback or carryforward provisions that match credits to income across periods. Each approach involves administrative burden and potential for dispute between taxpayers and tax authorities.

#### 4.2. Currency Conversion

Foreign income and tax typically arise in foreign currency while residence-state returns require domestic currency figures. The exchange rate selected for conversion affects both the income subject to residence-state tax and the credit available to offset that tax.

Using different rates for income conversion and tax credit conversion can produce distorted results. If income is converted at an earlier rate when the foreign currency was stronger and the tax credit is converted at a later rate when it was weaker, the effective foreign tax rate as calculated for credit purposes may significantly understate the actual burden. Conversely, opposite rate movements can overstate the foreign rate.

Most residence-state systems require consistent treatment to prevent manipulation, but specific rules vary considerably. Some countries require conversion at the rate when income was earned, others at the rate when tax was paid, and still others at average rates for the relevant period. Taxpayers must navigate these varying requirements, maintaining appropriate documentation of rates applied and ensuring consistent methodology across periods.

### 5. Exemption Method: Progression and Loss Issues

#### 5.1. Calculating Exemption with Progression

Exemption with progression, the standard form of exemption under Article 23A(3), requires the residence state to exclude foreign income from the tax base while including it when calculating the applicable tax rate. This mechanism preserves progressive rate structures while exempting foreign income from residence-state taxation.

Implementation requires the residence state to value foreign income for rate calculation purposes even though that income will not be taxed. Different valuation methods—using residence-state concepts versus accepting source-state figures—can produce varying results. The residence state must also determine how to treat foreign income that would be classified differently under its own rules, such as income treated as capital gains at source but as ordinary income under residence-state law.

#### 5.2. Treatment of Foreign Losses

The treatment of foreign losses under exemption with progression presents a policy choice. If foreign operations generate losses rather than profits, should those losses reduce the average rate applied to domestic income?

Allowing negative progression would mean that foreign losses reduce the tax rate on domestic income, providing residence-state tax relief for foreign losses even though the residence state would not share in foreign profits when operations become profitable. Most countries deny negative progression on this basis, requiring the rate calculation to ignore foreign losses. The taxpayer cannot use foreign losses to obtain a more favourable rate on domestic income while simultaneously benefiting from exemption when foreign operations generate profits.

#### 5.3. Subject-to-Tax Complications

Subject-to-tax clauses condition residence-state exemption on actual taxation at source. If the source state does not exercise its taxing right—whether due to domestic incentives, classification differences, or structural features—the residence state is not obliged to provide exemption.

These clauses create verification burdens. The residence state must determine whether and at what rate the source state taxed the income. This requires documentation proving foreign taxation occurred, analysis of whether partial exemptions or incentives reduced the source rate below the threshold, application of minimum rate thresholds that trigger denial or switch-over, and resolution of classification differences where states characterise the same payment differently.

Classification mismatches produce particular difficulties. The residence state may classify a payment as business profits and provide exemption on the assumption that the source state will tax under its permanent establishment rules. The source state may classify the same payment as royalties subject to zero withholding under the treaty. Neither state taxes the income, producing double non-taxation that the subject-to-tax clause should theoretically prevent—but only if the residence state has the information and legal framework to identify and respond to the mismatch.

### 6. Hybrid Mismatches and Linking Rules

#### 6.1. The Double Non-Taxation Problem

Hybrid mismatches arise when the same arrangement receives different tax treatment in two jurisdictions, creating outcomes that neither jurisdiction would permit if acting alone. The most common pattern is deduction without inclusion: the payment is deductible in the source state while exempt or not recognised in the residence state. *(covered in December 2024)*

Hybrid financial instruments exemplify this problem. An instrument treated as debt in the source state generates deductible interest payments for the payer. The same instrument, treated as equity in the residence state, generates exempt dividend income for the recipient under participation exemption. The payment reduces taxable income at source without creating corresponding income at residence.

Hybrid entity arrangements produce similar results. An entity treated as transparent in one jurisdiction and opaque in the other can generate deductions that are not matched with inclusions, or allow income to escape both jurisdictions' tax nets through conflicting residence and source claims.

The exemption method contributes to these outcomes when residence states exempt payments that source states have treated as deductible expenses. The credit method avoids this particular difficulty since credit is only available for foreign tax actually paid—but classification mismatches can still create double non-taxation where the source state does not impose tax.

#### 6.2. BEPS Action 2 Responses

The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action 2 introduced linking rules to neutralise hybrid mismatch outcomes. These rules operate hierarchically to ensure that at least one jurisdiction taxes the income without creating double taxation through both jurisdictions acting simultaneously.

The primary rule applies in the source state and denies deduction for payments that produce a deduction-without-inclusion outcome. If the recipient does not include the payment in taxable income, the payer cannot deduct it. This approach addresses the mismatch at its origin by removing the source-state benefit.

The secondary rule applies in the residence state as a defensive measure when the source state has not applied the primary rule. The residence state requires inclusion of the payment in taxable income, overriding participation exemption or other provisions that would otherwise exclude it. This ensures taxation even where the source state has not acted.

The rule hierarchy prevents both jurisdictions acting simultaneously, which would create double taxation. Only if the primary rule has not neutralised the mismatch does the secondary rule apply. This ordering requires coordination and information exchange between jurisdictions—the residence state must know whether the source state has denied deduction before determining whether to require inclusion.

Linking rules preserve domestic sovereignty in that each country maintains its own classification rules. Unlike tax harmonisation, which would require uniform treatment across jurisdictions, linking rules accept classification differences but neutralise their adverse consequences. This pragmatic approach recognises that political agreement on harmonised treatment is unlikely while still addressing the revenue concerns that hybrid mismatches create.

### 7. Documentation and Verification Burdens

Both credit and exemption methods impose documentation requirements on taxpayers seeking relief. For credit claims, the taxpayer must demonstrate the source of income, the foreign tax paid, treaty eligibility through residence certificates, and timing of when liabilities accrued and payments were made. For exemption claims, particularly where subject-to-tax conditions apply, the taxpayer must prove that source-state taxation occurred at the required rate.

Language and format differences create practical obstacles. A foreign tax assessment in Korean, Arabic, or Portuguese provides limited utility to a tax authority unfamiliar with those languages and administrative formats. Translation and certification requirements add cost and delay.

Time constraints compound these difficulties. Obtaining certified documentation from foreign authorities may take months, while domestic filing deadlines proceed regardless. Taxpayers may need to file provisional claims and amend subsequently, creating administrative burden for both taxpayer and authority.

Audit risk extends beyond initial filing. If the residence state audits relief claims years later, the taxpayer must produce documentation that may be difficult to retrieve from foreign jurisdictions operating different retention requirements and responding to requests on their own timelines.

The OECD Common Reporting Standard and bilateral exchange agreements increasingly allow tax authorities to verify foreign tax information directly through automatic exchange of financial account information, spontaneous exchange of tax rulings, and request-based exchange for specific taxpayers. These developments reduce documentation burden on taxpayers but simultaneously increase transparency and audit exposure, as authorities gain access to information that taxpayers might previously have failed to volunteer.

The practical difficulties examined in this chapter explain why relief from international double taxation often falls short of its theoretical promise. Understanding these obstacles helps practitioners anticipate problems, structure arrangements to minimise difficulties, and advise on whether credit or exemption methods may prove more workable in particular circumstances.
