## 1. The Gap Between Theory and Practice

### 1. Why This Topic Matters

The theoretical operation of relief methods appears elegant in treaty articles:
- **Credit (Article 23B)**: "Credit shall be allowed equal to the tax paid"
- **Exemption (Article 23A)**: "Shall exempt such income from tax"

In practice, these simple statements mask extraordinary complexity. This chapter examines what happens when theory meets reality across 200+ sovereign tax jurisdictions, each with different rules on timing, currency, income classification, and administration.

**Exam Relevance**: Practical difficulties often transform straightforward Part A questions into challenging policy discussions. In Part B scenarios, identifying practical difficulties demonstrates sophisticated understanding that earns top marks.

## 2. Credit Method: What Is a Creditable "Tax"?

### 1. The Fundamental Question

Not every payment to a foreign government qualifies for credit. The residence state must determine whether the foreign levy is actually an **income tax** entitled to relief.

**Concept-Focused Example: June 2025 Q5 Scenario**

The June 2025 exam asked whether a residence state must grant FTC for a foreign "Market Presence Adjustment" (MPA) that:
- Applies to non-residents based on user activity
- Is calculated on gross receipts (no deductions)
- Operates outside the source state's corporate income tax system
- Is called a "market-based contribution" in domestic law

This exemplifies the core exam question: **Is this payment a creditable tax?**

### 2. The Creditability Test

Most countries apply a multi-factor test for creditability:

```
IS THE FOREIGN LEVY CREDITABLE?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Is it COMPULSORY?
        │
        No → Not creditable (voluntary contributions excluded)
        │
        Yes ↓

STEP 2: Is it an INCOME tax (or equivalent)?
        │
        │   Key factors:
        │   • Based on realised net gain/profit?
        │   • Allows deduction of expenses?
        │   • Applies to gross income without deductions? (caution)
        │
        No → Not creditable (property tax, VAT, stamp duty excluded)
        │
        Yes ↓

STEP 3: Is the levy FINAL (non-refundable)?
        │
        No → Credit only for non-refundable portion
        │
        Yes ↓

STEP 4: Does it relate to the SAME INCOME being taxed?
        │
        No → Apportionment required
        │
        Yes ↓

POTENTIALLY CREDITABLE (subject to limitation)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Problematic Categories

**Digital Services Taxes (DSTs)**: Many countries introduced DSTs on gross revenues of digital businesses. These typically:
- Apply to gross turnover, not net income
- Target specific sectors (digital advertising, online marketplaces)
- May not allow deductions

**Result**: Most DSTs fail the "income tax" test and are not creditable. This was a hot topic in OECD Pillar One discussions—countries using credit systems faced potential double taxation on DST-covered income.

**Gross-Basis Withholding Taxes**: When withholding applies to gross payments without deductions, the effective rate on net income may exceed 100%:

*Example*: A 25% withholding tax on gross royalty payments where deductible expenses are 60% of gross:
- Gross royalty: €100
- Withholding (25%): €25
- Net profit after expenses: €40
- Effective rate on net: €25/€40 = **62.5%**

Some countries apply "reasonableness" tests, limiting credit to what would apply if the tax were on net income.

**Taxes with Refund Rights**: If shareholders can claim refunds of dividend withholding tax, is the full amount creditable initially?

*General rule*: Credit available only for the **non-refundable** portion. If refund is merely optional, full credit may be available until refund is claimed.

### 4. Current Development: US FTC Regulations

The US Treasury's 2022 final FTC regulations (with transitional relief through 2023-2024) tightened creditability requirements:

- Foreign tax must be based on "net gain" with allowance for cost recovery
- Must meet "attribution" requirements (linked to residence state's income)
- Must satisfy "source" requirements

**Practical Impact**: Many foreign taxes previously credited may no longer qualify, creating compliance complexity and potential double taxation.

---

## 3. Credit Method: Limitation Structures

### 1. Why Limitations Exist

Credit limitations prevent foreign taxes from reducing residence-state tax on **domestic** income:

```
WHY CREDIT MUST BE LIMITED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITHOUT LIMITATION:
  • Domestic income: €1,000,000 at 25% = €250,000 domestic tax
  • Foreign income: €100,000 at 60% = €60,000 foreign tax
  • Total pre-credit tax: €250,000 + €25,000 = €275,000
  • Credit claimed: €60,000
  • Tax payable: €215,000

  PROBLEM: €35,000 excess credit reduced tax on domestic income!

WITH LIMITATION:
  • Credit limited to residence-state tax on foreign income
  • Maximum credit: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000
  • Excess credit: €35,000 (cannot offset domestic-source tax)

  RESULT: Foreign tax doesn't erode domestic tax base
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Types of Limitation Systems

| System | Description | Policy Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Overall limitation** | Single limit based on all foreign income combined | Simple; allows cross-crediting between high/low-tax countries |
| **Per-country limitation** | Separate limit for each source country | Prevents high-tax country credits offsetting low-tax country income |
| **Basket/category system** | Separate limits by income type (passive, active, etc.) | Prevents "mixing" of different income characters |

**Concept-Focused Example: Basket Limitation Effect**

US taxpayer has:
- **Passive basket**: €100,000 foreign dividends taxed at 5% (€5,000 foreign tax)
- **General basket**: €100,000 foreign active business income taxed at 40% (€40,000 foreign tax)

US tax rate: 21%

| Without Baskets | With Baskets |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Combined foreign income: €200,000 | Passive: €100,000 × 21% = €21,000 limit |
| Combined foreign tax: €45,000 | General: €100,000 × 21% = €21,000 limit |
| US tax on €200,000: €42,000 | Passive credit: €5,000 (no excess) |
| Credit allowed: €42,000 | General credit: €21,000 (€19,000 excess) |
| Excess: €3,000 | Total excess: €19,000 |

**Policy Insight**: Without baskets, excess credits from high-tax active income would absorb the domestic tax on low-tax passive income. Baskets prevent this "cross-crediting."

### 3. Excess Credit Treatment

When foreign tax exceeds the limitation, countries handle the excess differently:

| Treatment | Countries | Practical Impact |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Carry forward** | UK (unlimited), US (10 years) | Credits eventually used if future foreign income taxed lower |
| **Carry back** | US (1 year) | Can recover prior-year domestic tax |
| **Forfeit** | Some developing countries | Permanent double taxation |
| **Per-country pools** | Germany | Excess in one country can't offset another |

**Planning Insight**: In excess credit positions, taxpayers may:
- Accelerate low-tax foreign income to absorb excess credits
- Defer high-tax foreign income to spread credits over time
- Restructure to use exemption-method jurisdictions instead

---

## 4. Credit Method: Timing and Currency Issues

### 1. Different Tax Year-Ends

**The Problem**: Source and residence states often use different fiscal years.

```
TIMING MISMATCH ILLUSTRATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

UK Parent (December year-end)
Indian Branch (April-March fiscal year)

INDIAN FISCAL YEAR: April 2024 → March 2025
                         │
         ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
         │                               │
    Apr-Dec 2024                    Jan-Mar 2025
    (UK Tax Year 2024)              (UK Tax Year 2025)
         │                               │
      9 months                        3 months

QUESTIONS ARISING:
  1. How to allocate Indian profits between UK years?
  2. When can UK claim credit for Indian tax?
  3. What if Indian assessment issued after UK filing deadline?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Solutions Used**:
- **Accrual basis**: Credit when liability arises (not when paid)
- **Provisional claims**: Estimate credit, adjust when final
- **Amended returns**: File based on estimates, amend later
- **Carryback/forward**: Match credits to income across periods

### 2. Currency Conversion

**The Problem**: Which exchange rate to use when foreign income and tax are in different currencies?

**Concept-Focused Example: Currency Impact**

UK company earns XCU 1,000,000 in Country X, pays XCU 250,000 tax (25% rate).

Exchange rates during the year:
- When income earned: £1 = XCU 1.50
- When tax assessed: £1 = XCU 1.60
- When tax paid: £1 = XCU 1.80

| Conversion Method | Income (£) | Tax Credit (£) | Effective Foreign Rate |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| All at earning rate (1.50) | 666,667 | 166,667 | 25.0% |
| All at payment rate (1.80) | 555,556 | 138,889 | 25.0% |
| Income at earning, tax at payment | 666,667 | 138,889 | **20.8%** |
| Income at average, tax at payment | 606,061 | 138,889 | **22.9%** |

**Key Insight**: Using **different rates** for income and tax can artificially inflate or deflate the effective foreign tax rate, creating phantom excess credits or undertaxation.

**Policy Consideration**: Most countries require **consistent** treatment, but specific rules vary significantly.

---

## 5. Exemption Method: Progression and Loss Issues

### 1. Exemption with Progression Complexity

While theoretically simpler than credit, exemption with progression creates its own difficulties:

**Issue 1: Calculating the Average Rate**

To apply the average worldwide rate to domestic income, the residence state must **value** foreign income even though it won't tax it. Different valuation methods produce different results.

**Issue 2: Treatment of Foreign Losses**

What if the foreign operation generates a **loss**?

```
FOREIGN LOSS UNDER EXEMPTION WITH PROGRESSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO:
  • Domestic income: €300,000
  • Foreign loss: (€100,000)
  • Progressive rates: 20% up to €200,000; 40% above

OPTION A: Ignore foreign loss for progression
  • Tax calculated on €300,000 only
  • €200,000 × 20% + €100,000 × 40% = €80,000

OPTION B: Include foreign loss in progression ("negative progression")
  • Worldwide "income": €300,000 - €100,000 = €200,000
  • Average rate on €200,000: 20%
  • Tax on €300,000 at 20% = €60,000

DIFFERENCE: €20,000 less tax under Option B

POLICY QUESTION: Should taxpayer benefit from foreign losses
                 while residence state can't tax foreign profits?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Country Approaches**: Most countries **deny** negative progression benefits (Option A), preventing taxpayers from using foreign losses to reduce domestic tax rates while exempting foreign profits.

### 2. Subject-to-Tax Complications

Subject-to-tax clauses make exemption conditional on actual source-state taxation. This creates verification burdens:

**Practical Difficulties**:
- How to prove foreign tax was paid?
- What if source state provides partial exemption (holiday, incentive)?
- What rate threshold triggers switch-over?
- What if classification differs between states?

**Concept-Focused Example: Classification Mismatch**

Country R (residence) classifies a payment as "business profits" → exempt under Article 7
Country S (source) classifies the same payment as "royalties" → 0% withholding under treaty

**Result**:
- Country R exempts because "source state may tax business profits"
- Country S doesn't tax because "royalties" have 0% withholding
- **Double non-taxation** results

This is precisely the situation BEPS Action 2 linking rules address.

---

## 6. Hybrid Mismatches and Linking Rules

### 1. When Credit and Exemption Create Double Non-Taxation

**December 2024 Q5** directly tested this topic—comparing linking rules to tax harmonisation as solutions to hybrid mismatch double non-taxation.

```
HYBRID MISMATCH: D/NI OUTCOME
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

D/NI = Deduction/No Inclusion

STRUCTURE:
  Parent Co (Country P) ←─── Dividend ───── Sub Co (Country S)
                            (Hybrid
                             Instrument)

Country S treatment: Payment is deductible INTEREST
  → Sub Co deducts payment, reducing taxable income

Country P treatment: Payment is exempt DIVIDEND
  → Parent Co applies participation exemption

RESULT:
  • Deduction at source (S): Reduces tax
  • No inclusion at residence (P): No tax
  • NET: Income escapes taxation in BOTH countries
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. BEPS Action 2 Linking Rules

BEPS Action 2 introduced **linking rules** to neutralise hybrid mismatches:

| Rule Type | Application | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Primary rule** | Source state (payer jurisdiction) | Deny deduction for payment causing D/NI |
| **Secondary rule** | Residence state (payee jurisdiction) | Include payment in income if primary rule not applied |

**How They Work**:

```
LINKING RULES IN OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Does hybrid mismatch exist?
        (Deduction at source + No inclusion at residence)
        │
        No → Normal rules apply
        │
        Yes ↓

STEP 2: Has source state applied PRIMARY RULE?
        (Denied deduction)
        │
        Yes → Mismatch neutralised; no further action
        │
        No ↓

STEP 3: Residence state applies SECONDARY RULE
        → Include payment in taxable income
        → Deny participation exemption for this payment

OUTCOME: One layer of taxation assured
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Linking Rules vs Tax Harmonisation (December 2024 Q5 Theme)

**Linking Rules**:
- Preserve domestic sovereignty—each country keeps its own rules
- React to mismatches when they occur
- Require coordination but not uniform rules
- Can be complex to administer

**Tax Harmonisation**:
- Uniform classification across all countries
- Eliminates mismatches at source
- Requires surrender of sovereignty
- Politically difficult to achieve

**Exam Insight**: A strong answer recognises that linking rules are the **practical** solution because tax harmonisation is politically unrealistic. However, linking rules create their own complexity (which rule applies? who goes first?).

---

## 7. Documentation and Verification Burdens

### 1. Proving Entitlement to Relief

Both credit and exemption methods require taxpayers to **prove** their entitlement:

| Requirement | Credit Method | Exemption Method |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Income source** | Must show income is foreign-source | Must show treaty applies |
| **Tax paid** | Documentary proof of foreign tax | Proof of source-state taxation (for subject-to-tax) |
| **Treaty status** | Residence certificate from both states | Same |
| **Timing** | When tax accrued/paid | When income earned |

### 2. Practical Challenges

**Language and Format**: Foreign tax documents may be in unfamiliar languages. A Korean tax assessment looks nothing like a UK assessment.

**Time Delays**: Obtaining certified documents from foreign authorities can take months. Filing deadlines often pass before documentation arrives.

**Audit Risk**: If the residence state audits the relief claim years later, the taxpayer must produce documentation that may be difficult to retrieve from foreign jurisdictions.

### 3. Current Development: Tax Information Exchange

The **OECD Common Reporting Standard** and **bilateral exchange agreements** increasingly allow tax authorities to verify foreign tax directly:

- Automatic exchange of financial account information
- Spontaneous exchange of tax rulings
- Request-based exchange for specific taxpayers

**Impact**: Reduces documentation burden on taxpayers but increases transparency and audit risk.

---

## 8. Pillar Two and Relief Method Interactions

### 1. How GloBE Rules Affect FTC Treatment

The OECD's June 2024 Administrative Guidance clarified how Pillar Two's GloBE rules interact with foreign tax credit limitations:

**Key Clarification**: When a parent entity suffers additional tax due to FTC limitation (i.e., excess credits that can't be used), that additional tax should be included in the parent's **covered tax** figure—not allocated to the subsidiary that generated the underlying income.

**Practical Impact**: This affects ETR calculations for GloBE purposes, potentially reducing top-up tax liability.

### 2. Exemption Method Under Pillar Two

Pillar Two creates an interesting tension with exemption systems:

| Traditional Exemption | Pillar Two Effect |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Foreign profits exempt at residence | IIR may require top-up tax if foreign ETR < 15% |
| Participation exemption for dividends | Excluded dividends rule (10% threshold) differs from domestic rules |
| No residence-state interest in foreign taxation | Residence state now monitors foreign ETR |

**Policy Shift**: Pillar Two effectively moves exemption countries **toward** credit-like outcomes for low-taxed income, while maintaining exemption for adequately-taxed income.

---

## 9. Worked Exam Example: June 2025 Q5 Style

### Question (25 marks)

*Country X is reviewing its foreign tax credit policy following Country Y's introduction of a "Market Presence Adjustment" (MPA) on non-resident enterprises. The MPA:*
- *Applies to non-residents with gross revenue from Country Y users exceeding a threshold*
- *Is calculated using a formula based on user numbers, engagement, and transaction volumes*
- *Is levied on gross receipts (no deductions)*
- *Is collected by Country Y's tax authority and paid into general revenue*
- *Operates outside Country Y's corporate income tax system*

*Countries X and Y have a DTC identical to the OECD MTC 2017, with Article 23B (credit method) applying.*

*Required:*
*(1) Whether Country X must grant FTC for MPA amounts paid to Country Y (18 marks)*
*(2) Wider treaty policy considerations (7 marks)*

### Model Answer Framework

**Part 1: FTC Creditability Analysis (18 marks)**

**Issue Identification (3 marks)**
The central question is whether Country Y's MPA qualifies as a "tax" for which Country X must grant credit under Article 23B. This requires analysis of:
- Whether MPA is covered by Article 2 (Taxes Covered)
- Whether it satisfies domestic creditability requirements
- Treaty interaction with domestic characterisation

**Article 2 Analysis (5 marks)**

Article 2(1) covers "taxes on income." The MPA presents difficulties:
- **Gross receipts basis**: Unlike income taxes, MPA allows no deductions for costs. This resembles a turnover tax more than an income tax.
- **Separate from income tax system**: Country Y explicitly operates MPA outside its corporate income tax, suggesting it's not an "income tax."
- **Label vs substance**: Country Y calls it a "market-based contribution"—nomenclature suggests non-tax character.

Article 2(4) extends coverage to "identical or substantially similar" taxes introduced after the DTC. The MPA's novel character (user-based, gross receipts) makes "substantially similar" argument weak.

**Domestic Creditability Test (5 marks)**

Most countries require foreign levies to have the "predominant character" of an income tax:
- **Net income requirement**: MPA on gross receipts fails this—no deduction for costs means effective rate on net income could exceed 100%
- **Compulsory character**: MPA is compulsory—satisfies this element
- **Income relation**: MPA relates to revenue derived from users, not necessarily the same income Country X taxes—attribution concerns

**Conclusion on Creditability (2 marks)**

On balance, Country X would likely **not** be required to grant FTC for MPA:
- MPA is not listed in Article 2(3)
- Not "substantially similar" to listed taxes
- Fails domestic "income tax" character tests
- However, this creates **double taxation** for Country X residents

**Alternative Approaches (3 marks)**

Country X could consider:
- **Deduction** instead of credit (reduces income, provides partial relief)
- **Treaty amendment** to specifically address MPA
- **MAP procedure** to resolve characterisation bilaterally
- **Domestic unilateral relief** outside the treaty

**Part 2: Treaty Policy Considerations (7 marks)**

**Preventing Treaty Abuse (2 marks)**
If Country X must credit any foreign levy called a "tax," countries could game the system by labelling turnover taxes as income taxes. Limiting credit to genuine income taxes prevents abuse.

**Reciprocity Concerns (2 marks)**
If Country Y's MPA doesn't qualify for credit, Country Y residents paying Country X taxes should expect reciprocal treatment. This creates incentive for both countries to maintain creditability standards.

**OECD Pillar One Context (2 marks)**
The MPA resembles Pillar One Amount A concepts (market-based allocation). Countries negotiating Pillar One addressed relief for Amount A—similar mechanisms may evolve for DSTs and MPAs.

**Policy Recommendation (1 mark)**
Country X should engage Country Y through MAP to clarify MPA's treatment and potentially negotiate treaty protocol addressing novel taxes.

## 10. Common Exam Errors to Avoid

```
EXAMINER INSIGHTS: WHAT LOSES MARKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ERROR 1: Assuming all foreign taxes are creditable
  ✗ "Country X must credit the foreign tax paid"
  ✓ Always analyse whether the levy qualifies as a creditable
    income tax using the multi-factor test

ERROR 2: Ignoring limitation rules
  ✗ "The credit equals the foreign tax"
  ✓ Credit is limited to residence-state tax on foreign income;
    excess creates practical difficulties

ERROR 3: Treating exemption as simple
  ✗ "Foreign income is exempt, so there's no difficulty"
  ✓ Exemption with progression requires valuing exempt income;
    subject-to-tax clauses require verification; foreign losses
    create complications

ERROR 4: Missing hybrid mismatch issues
  ✗ Discussing credit/exemption without noting D/NI risks
  ✓ Always consider whether classification mismatches create
    double non-taxation—this is a key examiner focus post-BEPS

ERROR 5: Calculation focus over concept focus
  ✗ Spending time on detailed numerical workings
  ✓ For policy questions, use illustrative numbers only;
    focus on explaining WHY difficulties arise and HOW
    countries address them

ERROR 6: Ignoring current developments
  ✗ Discussing relief methods without Pillar Two context
  ✓ Modern exam answers should reference GloBE interactions,
    DST creditability debates, and linking rules
