## Chapter 4.2: Causes of International Double Taxation - Conflicting Definitions of Connecting Factors

### 1. The Definitional Problem

International double taxation frequently arises not from different types of taxing rights—residence versus source—but from different definitions of the same connecting factor. Each state determines its own criteria for residence, source, and other connecting factors under domestic law, and these definitions frequently overlap in ways that subject the same income to taxation in multiple jurisdictions.

The absence of a supranational tax authority means there is no universal standard for defining concepts such as "residence" or "source of income." Each state exercises sovereign power to define these terms according to its own policy objectives, administrative capabilities, and legal traditions. A state favouring physical presence tests may adopt different day-counting rules than its neighbours; another may emphasise subjective factors such as permanent home or centre of vital interests. The result is a patchwork of overlapping and sometimes contradictory definitions that create fertile ground for double taxation even when both states purport to use residence as their primary connecting factor.

This problem extends beyond residence to encompass corporate residence, source rules, and permanent establishment thresholds. When two states each conclude under their domestic law that they possess the right to tax the same income—because their definitions of the relevant connecting factor differ—juridical double taxation results absent treaty relief.

### 2. Individual Residence Conflicts

#### 2.1. Variations in Domestic Residence Tests

States employ fundamentally different approaches to determine individual tax residence. **Physical presence tests** count days spent within the jurisdiction—the 183-day rule appears in numerous domestic laws, though states vary in whether they count by calendar year, fiscal year, or rolling period, and whether partial days count. Germany, France, and Japan exemplify this objective approach.

**Permanent home and centre of vital interests tests** focus on qualitative factors—where the individual maintains a dwelling and where personal and economic ties are strongest. Belgium and the Netherlands traditionally emphasised these subjective factors, which may apply regardless of days present.

**Statutory hybrid tests** combine multiple elements. The United Kingdom's Statutory Residence Test, introduced in 2013, applies automatic tests based on presence thresholds and then considers connection factors including available accommodation, family location, and substantive work ties. Meeting certain presence thresholds triggers residence; meeting others with sufficient connection factors also triggers residence.

These variations create obvious conflict scenarios. An individual spending 120 days working in the United Kingdom and 100 days with family in France may be resident in both under domestic law—the UK based on work ties and sufficient presence, France based on family location and centre of vital interests.

#### 2.2. The Article 4(2) Tie-Breaker

Article 4(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention explicitly defers to domestic law, treating a person as resident of a contracting state if "liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature." The treaty does not create an autonomous residence definition but accepts each state's domestic determination.

When domestic laws produce dual residence, Article 4(2) provides tie-breaker rules to determine residence for treaty purposes only. These rules operate as a hierarchical sequence—once a test resolves the conflict, subsequent tests are not applied.

The **permanent home test** asks whether the individual has a dwelling arranged and retained for permanent use, continuously available to them. A home rented to unrelated third parties fails this availability requirement. When the individual has a permanent home in one state only, treaty residence lies in that state.

When permanent homes exist in both states, the **centre of vital interests** sub-test examines where personal and economic relations are closer. Personal relations—spouse, children, social connections—receive particular weight, though economic relations including employment, business activities, and investments also matter. The analysis examines circumstances as a whole rather than applying mechanical rules.

The **habitual abode** test applies when permanent home exists in neither state or when centre of vital interests proves indeterminate. This primarily quantitative analysis considers frequency, duration, and regularity of stays as part of a settled routine, though the qualitative nature of stays also matters.

The **nationality** test applies when habitual abode fails to resolve the conflict. If the individual holds nationality of only one contracting state, treaty residence lies there.

When all preceding tests fail, the **mutual agreement procedure** requires competent authorities to settle the residence question by agreement. This creates uncertainty for taxpayers, as MAP cases may take years to resolve.

The application of these tie-breaker rules featured in the June 2025 examination, which required analysis of a dual residence scenario involving a student moving between states (covered in June 2025).

#### 2.3. The Centre of Vital Interests Analysis

The centre of vital interests test merits particular attention given its frequent examination. The OECD Commentary provides that circumstances must be examined as a whole, with considerations based on personal acts receiving special attention. Relevant factors include family location and relationships, employment and business connections, political and cultural activities, and property ownership patterns.

Courts have varied in their emphasis. Some jurisdictions prioritise family location, viewing the presence of spouse and dependent children as decisive. Others focus on economic substance, examining where the individual earns income and manages investments. The totality of circumstances approach resists mechanical application but creates interpretive uncertainty.

### 3. Corporate Residence Conflicts

#### 3.1. Primary Tests for Corporate Residence

States use fundamentally different approaches to corporate residence. The **place of incorporation test** treats a company as resident where it is legally formed—a clear, easily administered standard that the United States applies. The **place of effective management** test looks to substance, examining where key management and commercial decisions are actually made. Germany and most civil law jurisdictions apply this approach. The **central management and control** test, traditional in UK law and Commonwealth countries, asks where the board of directors actually exercises control over the company.

These tests can produce dramatically different results. A company incorporated in Delaware with board meetings in London and operations managed from Frankfurt might be resident in all three jurisdictions under the relevant domestic laws, with each state claiming worldwide taxation rights.

#### 3.2. Article 4(3) and the 2017 Changes

Prior to 2017, the OECD Model used place of effective management as the automatic tie-breaker—a dual resident company was deemed resident where its POEM was situated. This approach encountered difficulties with modern multinational enterprises whose management functions are distributed across multiple locations, and with aggressive tax planning that exploited mobile POEM.

The 2017 revision removed the automatic POEM tie-breaker, replacing it with case-by-case determination through mutual agreement procedure. Competent authorities must now consider all relevant factors including where board meetings are held, where senior management operates, where key decisions are effectively made, and where main business activities are conducted. If authorities fail to reach agreement, the dual resident company may lose treaty benefits entirely—a significant consequence that creates planning uncertainty.

This change reflects the growing difficulty of determining "effective management" when video conferencing enables board meetings without physical presence and when operational decisions may be made by managers in different jurisdictions.

### 4. Source Definition Conflicts

#### 4.1. Common Source Rule Variations

Conflicts in source definitions arise when states apply different rules to determine where income arises. For **services income**, one state may source income where services are physically performed while another sources it where the customer receives benefit. Services performed in State A for a customer headquartered in State B may thus have source in both jurisdictions.

**Interest** may be sourced where the debtor is resident, where the loan contract was concluded, or where borrowed capital is actually used. When a State A resident borrows to finance operations in State B, conflicting source rules may attribute source to both.

**Royalties** may be sourced where the payer is resident or where the intellectual property is actually used. Software licensed by a State A company to customers throughout State B may generate income with source in both jurisdictions under their respective domestic laws.

#### 4.2. Treaty Resolution Through Distributive Rules

Treaty distributive rules effectively create source definitions for treaty purposes, overriding conflicting domestic characterisations. Article 6 sources immovable property income where the property is located. Article 7 sources business profits where a permanent establishment exists. Article 10 sources dividends where the paying company is resident. Article 11 sources interest where the payer is resident, with exceptions for permanent establishment cases. Article 15 sources employment income where services are physically performed.

These treaty rules do not change domestic law—a state may still consider income to have domestic source under its internal provisions. However, the treaty limits taxing rights according to its own source definitions, preventing double taxation even when domestic source rules conflict.

### 5. Practical Implications

#### 5.1. When Tie-Breakers Fail

The Article 4(2) tie-breaker hierarchy usually produces a clear result, but cases exist where multiple tests prove indeterminate. An individual with permanent homes in both states, mixed personal and economic ties, similar presence in each jurisdiction, and dual nationality may reach the mutual agreement procedure stage. Corporate dual residence after 2017 necessarily involves MAP determination given the removal of the automatic POEM rule.

MAP resolution creates several practical difficulties. The process may take two to three years. During pendency, the taxpayer faces uncertainty about which state has primary taxing rights and whether treaty benefits are available. Some treaties provide that pending MAP resolution, the taxpayer may not claim treaty benefits at all, potentially resulting in unrelieved double taxation until resolution.

#### 5.2. Domestic Law Consequences Persist

The tie-breaker rules determine residence for treaty purposes only—they do not change domestic law status. An individual deemed treaty resident in State A remains a domestic law resident of State B for purposes not affected by the treaty. This creates continuing compliance obligations in State B and may affect matters outside the treaty's scope, including inheritance tax, social security, and regulatory requirements.

Understanding this distinction is essential when advising internationally mobile individuals. Treaty residence allocation determines which state provides double taxation relief and which state's treaty network applies to third-country income, but domestic obligations in both states may persist.

#### 5.3. Planning Considerations

Definitional conflicts create both risks and planning opportunities. Taxpayers relocating between jurisdictions must understand the residence tests applied by both the departure and arrival states, as the timing and manner of relocation may affect residence status under each. Maintaining property in the former state of residence, retaining family members there, or continuing business activities may trigger dual residence even after physical relocation.

For corporate structures, the 2017 changes to Article 4(3) have increased uncertainty for entities with genuinely split management functions. While pre-2017 planning might have focused on locating POEM in a favourable jurisdiction, post-2017 planning must consider the risk that competent authorities may fail to agree on residence, potentially denying treaty benefits altogether. Companies with international governance structures should document where key decisions are made and consider whether simplifying decision-making locations might reduce dual residence risk.

The interaction between domestic law definitions and treaty tie-breakers also affects third-country situations. A taxpayer may be treaty resident in State A for purposes of the State A-State B treaty but remain domestic law resident in State B, affecting which treaty network applies when that taxpayer derives income from State C. These complexities require careful analysis of each bilateral relationship rather than assuming residence determined under one treaty applies universally.
