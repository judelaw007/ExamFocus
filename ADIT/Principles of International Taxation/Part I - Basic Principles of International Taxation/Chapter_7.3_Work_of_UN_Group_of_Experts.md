## Chapter 7.3: Work of the UN Group of Experts

### 1. Institutional Framework

#### 1.1. Origins and Evolution

While the OECD inherited most League of Nations tax treaty work, the United Nations also assumed a role in international tax matters—particularly representing developing countries not included in OECD membership. The initial decades saw limited UN activity in this area, with developing countries lacking a significant voice in the OECD-dominated treaty development process.

In 1967, the UN established an Ad Hoc Group of Experts on Tax Treaties between Developed and Developing Countries, recognising that developing country interests required dedicated attention. This group produced the first UN Model Convention in 1980, offering an alternative to the OECD Model with provisions more favourable to source-state taxation. The group was upgraded in 2004 to the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council with more permanent status and enhanced mandate.

The Committee has continued updating the UN Model, with significant revisions in 2011, 2017, and 2021. The 2021 update introduced Article 12B addressing digital economy taxation, demonstrating the UN's responsiveness to emerging issues affecting developing countries.

#### 1.2. The Committee of Experts

The UN Tax Committee comprises twenty-five members nominated by governments but serving in their personal capacity rather than as government representatives. Members serve four-year terms with geographical balance ensuring developing country majority. The Committee meets twice yearly, typically in March and October, to develop and update the UN Model Convention, produce practical guidance for developing countries, address capacity building needs, and coordinate with other international organisations while maintaining a distinct perspective oriented toward source-state taxation.

This structure differs significantly from the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs, where government delegates represent their countries' official positions. The personal capacity arrangement allows UN Committee members greater flexibility in developing positions that may diverge from their governments' immediate interests, potentially enabling more balanced consideration of competing concerns.

#### 1.3. Relationship with OECD

The UN and OECD tax work are complementary rather than competing. Both trace their origins to the League of Nations 1928 Models and share the same basic treaty architecture. The UN Model mirrors the OECD Model's structure, and the UN Commentary frequently quotes OECD Commentary with additions in square brackets indicating UN-specific positions.

Coordination occurs through the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, which brings together the International Monetary Fund, OECD, UN, and World Bank to avoid duplication in technical assistance and develop joint guidance on emerging issues. Despite this coordination, fundamental differences remain. The UN represents 193 member states compared to the OECD's 38 members. The OECD's membership comprises predominantly developed, capital-exporting countries, while the UN includes the full range of developing and developed economies. These different constituencies produce different policy orientations. *(covered in June 2022)*

### 2. The UN Model Double Taxation Convention

#### 2.1. Development History

The UN Model has evolved through successive versions since its 1980 introduction. The 1999 and 2001 updates incorporated developments from intervening decades with technical refinements. The 2011 revision substantially enhanced the Commentary and introduced new provisions. The 2017 update aligned the Model with BEPS outcomes where appropriate for developing country contexts. The 2021 version introduced Article 12B on automated digital services and made substantial updates throughout, with a further update expected in 2025 addressing services permanent establishment provisions.

#### 2.2. Source-Based Philosophy

The fundamental distinction between UN and OECD Models lies in their orientation toward source versus residence taxation. The OECD Model generally favours residence-state taxation, reflecting the interests of capital-exporting countries whose residents invest abroad. The UN Model favours source-state taxation, reflecting the interests of capital-importing countries where foreign investment generates economic activity.

This difference matters because capital typically flows from developed to developing countries. Under residence-focused rules, the country where investors reside retains primary taxing rights over investment returns. Under source-focused rules, the country hosting the investment—typically the developing country—retains greater taxing rights. The UN Model's source orientation addresses the North-South capital flow pattern by ensuring developing countries can tax economic activity occurring within their territories.

This philosophical difference manifests across multiple provisions. Investment income faces higher permitted withholding rates under the UN Model. Permanent establishment thresholds are lower, making it easier to establish taxable presence. Services can be taxed at source even without physical presence. These differences are not arbitrary but reflect a coherent policy of protecting host country revenue bases.

### 3. Key UN Model Provisions

#### 3.1. Permanent Establishment

The UN Model sets lower thresholds for establishing permanent establishment, the concept that determines when business profits become taxable in the source state. For construction projects, the UN Model requires only six months' duration compared to twelve months under the OECD Model. The UN Model expressly includes supervisory activities connected to construction as constituting permanent establishment, a provision absent from the OECD Model.

Most significantly, the UN Model includes a services permanent establishment provision. Where an enterprise furnishes services through employees or other personnel present in a country for periods exceeding 183 days in any twelve-month period, a permanent establishment exists. The OECD Model contains no general services permanent establishment provision, meaning that services rendered without fixed place of business escape source-state taxation. For developing countries that import substantial services—consulting, technical assistance, project management—this difference has significant revenue implications.

The UN Committee has approved a new Article 5A for expected inclusion in the 2025 update, addressing remote services taxation and allowing source states to tax services even without any physical presence in the jurisdiction.

#### 3.2. Investment Income

The UN Model permits higher withholding rates on investment income than the OECD Model. For dividends under Article 10, the OECD Model specifies maximum rates of 5% for substantial shareholdings and 15% for portfolio investments, whereas the UN Model leaves rates to bilateral negotiation, typically resulting in higher ceilings. For interest under Article 11, the OECD Model specifies 10% maximum source-state withholding, while the UN Model again leaves rates open for negotiation.

The most significant difference concerns royalties under Article 12. The OECD Model provides for exclusive residence-state taxation of royalties—no source-state tax at all. The UN Model permits the source state to impose withholding tax on royalties at a rate to be negotiated bilaterally. For developing countries that import intellectual property, technology, and know-how, paying royalties to foreign licensors, the ability to withhold tax on these payments represents substantial revenue that OECD Model treaties would deny them.

#### 3.3. Articles 12A and 12B

The UN Model contains two provisions with no OECD equivalent. Article 12A, introduced in the 2017 update, addresses fees for technical services—payments for managerial, technical, or consultancy services. Without this provision, such fees paid to non-residents without permanent establishment would be taxable only in the residence state under the business profits article. Article 12A permits the source state to impose withholding tax on gross payments, capturing revenue from the substantial technical expertise that developing countries import.

Article 12B, introduced in the 2021 update, addresses income from automated digital services. It applies to payments for services provided on the internet or electronic networks requiring minimal human involvement—online advertising, digital content provision, social media platforms, standardised online services. The source state may impose withholding tax on these payments regardless of the service provider's physical presence. *(covered in December 2023)*

Article 12B represents a pragmatic alternative to the OECD's Pillar One Amount A proposals for addressing digital economy taxation. Where Pillar One requires complex profit allocation formulae and multilateral convention implementation, Article 12B operates through simple gross withholding imposed at the bilateral treaty level. Developing countries can incorporate Article 12B into their treaty networks immediately through renegotiation, rather than awaiting completion of multilateral processes. The mechanism is simpler to administer and applies to all digital service providers regardless of size, unlike Pillar One's thresholds limiting application to the largest multinationals.

### 4. The UN Framework Convention

#### 4.1. Background and Development

A significant development in international tax governance is the UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, currently under negotiation. In November 2023, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 78/230 establishing an Ad Hoc Committee to develop terms of reference for an intergovernmental negotiating process. The Second Committee approved those terms of reference in November 2024, with 125 votes in favour, 9 against, and 46 abstentions.

The opposition and abstentions came predominantly from developed countries. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and Canada voted against, expressing concerns about duplication with OECD work and potential impact on existing BEPS and Pillar frameworks. The abstentions, mainly from developed countries, reflected similar hesitation about shifting international tax norm-setting from the OECD to the UN.

Intergovernmental negotiations began in 2025, with sessions scheduled through 2027. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee has agreed to develop two early protocols alongside the main convention text: one on taxation of cross-border services and another on dispute prevention and resolution. The final convention and protocols are expected to be presented to the General Assembly by autumn 2027.

#### 4.2. Scope and Implications

The Framework Convention represents developing countries' desire for greater voice in international tax governance. The OECD, despite its Inclusive Framework expanding participation, remains perceived as dominated by developed country interests. Its membership of 38 countries, predominantly wealthy economies, contrasts with the UN's universal membership of 193 states. Developing countries seek a forum where their concerns receive equal weight.

If adopted, the Framework Convention would represent the first binding multilateral tax convention negotiated through the UN. It is expected to address base erosion and profit shifting, tax evasion and illicit financial flows, environmental taxation, wealth and property taxation, and digital economy challenges. The convention creates potential competing standards to OECD-led initiatives, raising questions about how overlapping frameworks will coexist.

The shift toward UN leadership does not eliminate the need for coordination with OECD work. Many provisions will likely draw on OECD-developed concepts while adapting them for broader application. However, the UN process may produce outcomes reflecting different priorities—stronger source-state rights, greater emphasis on developing country capacity, and potentially different approaches to digital economy taxation than those emerging from OECD Pillar negotiations.

### 5. Comparative Assessment

Real bilateral tax treaties are rarely pure OECD or pure UN Model implementations. They typically use OECD structure and drafting as a foundation while incorporating UN provisions where developing country treaty partners insist. Withholding rates often fall between OECD and UN positions, reflecting negotiated compromise. Unique provisions address specific bilateral relationship concerns.

When analysing treaty provisions, the relevant question is whether particular articles follow OECD approaches favouring residence taxation, UN approaches favouring source taxation, or represent hybrid positions. This analytical framework applies regardless of which model a treaty officially references. A treaty nominally based on the OECD Model may contain UN-style source provisions; a UN Model-based treaty may adopt OECD rates in particular articles.

The choice between models reflects power dynamics in treaty negotiations. Developed country treaty partners typically prefer OECD provisions that protect their investors' returns from source-country taxation. Developing country partners prefer UN provisions that protect their revenue bases. Outcomes depend on each party's bargaining position, the importance of the treaty relationship, and specific economic circumstances driving the negotiation. Understanding both models and their underlying philosophies enables informed analysis of what any particular treaty provision achieves and whose interests it serves.
