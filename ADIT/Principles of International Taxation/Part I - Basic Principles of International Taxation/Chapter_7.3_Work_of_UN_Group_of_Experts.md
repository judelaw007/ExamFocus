## 1. Institutional Framework

### 1. Origins and Evolution

While the OECD inherited most League of Nations tax treaty work (Chapter 7.1), the United Nations also took on a role—particularly representing developing countries not included in the OECD membership:

| Period | Development | Significance |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **1946-1967** | Limited UN activity | Developing countries lack voice in OECD |
| **1967** | UN Group of Experts formed | Ad hoc group to address developing country concerns |
| **1980** | First UN Model Convention | Alternative to OECD Model favouring source states |
| **2004** | Upgraded to Committee of Experts | ECOSOC subsidiary; more permanent status |
| **2021** | Current UN Model published | Major update including digital economy provisions |
| **2024** | Framework Convention process | Intergovernmental negotiations begin |

### 2. The Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters

The **UN Tax Committee** is the primary UN body responsible for international tax matters:

**Composition:**
- 25 members nominated by governments but serving in personal capacity
- Four-year terms (current: 2021-2025; new membership: 2025-2029)
- Geographical balance with traditional majority from developing countries
- Meets twice yearly (typically March and October)

**Mandate:**
- Develop and update the UN Model Double Taxation Convention
- Produce practical guidance for developing countries
- Address capacity building and technical assistance
- Coordinate with OECD while maintaining distinct perspective

```
UN VS OECD INSTITUTIONAL COMPARISON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

              UN TAX COMMITTEE              OECD CFA
              ─────────────────             ────────────────
Membership:   25 experts (personal)         Government delegates
Focus:        Developing countries          Developed countries
Model bias:   SOURCE STATE rights           RESIDENCE STATE rights
Resources:    Limited secretariat           Substantial secretariat
Meetings:     2 sessions/year               Multiple WP meetings
Outputs:      UN Model + Manual             OECD Model + Commentary

KEY DISTINCTION: Same foundational concepts, DIFFERENT emphasis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Relationship with OECD

The UN and OECD tax work are complementary rather than competing:

- **Common foundation**: Both trace to League of Nations 1928 Models
- **Structural similarity**: UN Model mirrors OECD Model structure
- **Commentary approach**: UN quotes OECD Commentary with additions in square brackets
- **Coordination mechanisms**: Joint participation in Platform for Collaboration on Tax (IMF, OECD, UN, World Bank)

**Key differences:**
- UN represents 193 member states vs OECD's 38 members
- UN emphasises source taxation; OECD emphasises residence
- UN has fewer resources but broader legitimacy among developing countries

## 2. The UN Model Double Taxation Convention

### 1. Development History

| Year | Version | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **1980** | First UN Model | Established source-focused alternative to OECD |
| **1999** | Update | Incorporated developments from 1980s-90s |
| **2001** | Update | Technical refinements |
| **2011** | Major revision | Enhanced Commentary; new provisions |
| **2017** | Update | Aligned with BEPS outcomes |
| **2021** | Current version | Article 12B (digital services); substantial updates |
| **2025** | Expected update | Article 5A (services PE) and other changes |

### 2. Core Philosophy: Source-Based Taxation

The UN Model's fundamental orientation differs from the OECD Model:

| Principle | UN Model Approach | OECD Model Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Investment income** | Higher source withholding rates | Lower source withholding rates |
| **Services** | Tax where performed | Tax where recipient resident |
| **PE threshold** | Lower threshold (easier to establish) | Higher threshold |
| **Philosophy** | Protect host country revenue | Protect home country investment |

**Why source taxation matters for developing countries:**
- Capital typically flows FROM developed TO developing countries
- Residence taxation benefits capital exporters
- Source taxation allows developing countries to tax economic activity on their territory
- Addresses North-South capital flow imbalance

```
EXAM TIP: The Source vs Residence Question
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

When comparing UN and OECD Models, the CORE distinction is:

     OECD = Residence-focused → Benefits capital EXPORTERS
     UN   = Source-focused   → Benefits capital IMPORTERS

This explains WHY:
• Developing countries (net capital importers) prefer UN Model
• Developed countries (net capital exporters) prefer OECD Model
• Treaty negotiations involve balancing these competing interests

ALWAYS frame your exam answer around this fundamental difference.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 3. Key UN Model Provisions Differing from OECD

### 1. Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

**Lower PE thresholds in UN Model:**

| Aspect | UN Model | OECD Model |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Construction PE** | 6 months | 12 months |
| **Supervisory activities** | Expressly included | Not included |
| **Services PE** | 183 days in 12 months | No general services PE |
| **Insurance** | Specific PE provision | Standard rules apply |

**Article 5A (proposed 2025):**
The UN Committee approved a new Article 5A for the 2025 update addressing remote services taxation—allowing source states to tax services even without physical presence.

### 2. Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

**UN Model provides two alternatives:**

| Alternative | Treatment | Beneficiary |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Alternative A** | Exclusive residence taxation | Aligns with OECD |
| **Alternative B** | Formulary apportionment for shipping | Source state shares |

Alternative B allows the source state to tax a portion of shipping profits if operations are "more than casual"—reflecting developing countries' interest in taxing foreign shipping lines using their ports.

### 3. Articles 10, 11, 12 - Investment Income

**Higher withholding rates under UN Model:**

| Article | Income Type | OECD Rate | UN Rate |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Art. 10** | Dividends (portfolio) | 15% | Varies (left to negotiation) |
| **Art. 10** | Dividends (substantial) | 5% | Varies (left to negotiation) |
| **Art. 11** | Interest | 10% | Varies (higher permitted) |
| **Art. 12** | Royalties | 0% (exclusive residence) | Varies (source retention) |

**Critical difference - Article 12 (Royalties):**
- OECD Model: Taxable ONLY in residence state
- UN Model: Source state MAY tax (rate left to negotiation)
- This reflects developing countries' concern about technology payments flowing abroad untaxed

### 4. Article 12A - Fees for Technical Services (UN ONLY)

```
EXAM FOCUS: Article 12A - A Uniquely UN Provision
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Article 12A was introduced in the 2017 UN Model update:

SCOPE: Payments for managerial, technical, or consultancy services

WHY IT MATTERS:
• Developing countries import substantial technical expertise
• Without Art 12A, fees go untaxed at source if no PE exists
• Art 12A allows withholding tax on gross payment
• Addresses gap not covered by Art 7 (business profits)

EXAM APPLICATION:
When advising on tax treaties with developing countries, ALWAYS
consider whether Art 12A (or equivalent domestic provision)
applies to service fees.

Compare to OECD Model: No equivalent provision—services without
PE taxable only in residence state.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5. Article 12B - Income from Automated Digital Services (UN ONLY)

Introduced in the **2021 UN Model Update**, Article 12B addresses digital economy taxation:

**Key features:**
- Applies to "automated digital services" (online advertising, user data sales, online platforms, etc.)
- Source state may impose withholding tax on gross payments
- Applies regardless of physical presence
- Rate subject to bilateral negotiation

**Relationship to OECD Pillar One:**
- Article 12B is simpler and more immediate than Pillar One Amount A
- Pillar One requires complex profit allocation; Art 12B uses gross withholding
- Developing countries can implement Art 12B unilaterally through treaty negotiation
- Article 12B seen as pragmatic alternative if Pillar One stalls

| Feature | Article 12B (UN) | Pillar One Amount A (OECD) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Gross withholding tax | Formulary profit reallocation |
| **Complexity** | Low | Very high |
| **Implementation** | Bilateral treaties | Multilateral convention |
| **Status** | Available now | Under negotiation |
| **Scope** | All digital services | Largest MNEs only |

## 4. UN Model in Practice

### 1. Country Adoption Patterns

**Countries favouring UN Model provisions:**

| Region | Examples | Common UN Features Adopted |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Africa** | Kenya, Zambia, Botswana | Source withholding rights, services taxation |
| **Asia** | India, Indonesia, Philippines | Art 12A-type provisions, higher withholding |
| **Latin America** | Brazil, Argentina, Chile | Source state emphasis |

**India example:**
India explicitly prefers UN Model principles:
- Includes fees for technical services (FTS) article in most treaties
- Maintains higher withholding rates than OECD norms
- Actively participates in UN Tax Committee

### 2. Hybrid Approaches

Many treaties combine UN and OECD elements:

```
TREATY DRAFTING REALITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Real bilateral tax treaties are NOT pure OECD or pure UN.

They typically:
• Use OECD structure and drafting
• Incorporate UN provisions where developing country insists
• Negotiate rates between OECD and UN positions
• Include unique provisions based on bilateral relationship

EXAM IMPLICATION:
When analysing treaty provisions, identify whether they:
(a) Follow OECD Model (residence-focused)
(b) Follow UN Model (source-focused)
(c) Represent a negotiated hybrid

This analytical framework demonstrates understanding.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 5. UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation

### 1. Background and Development

A significant development is the **UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation**, currently under negotiation:

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **November 2023** | UN General Assembly Resolution 78/230 establishes Ad Hoc Committee |
| **April-August 2024** | Terms of Reference negotiated |
| **November 2024** | UNGA Second Committee approves ToR (125 for, 9 against, 46 abstentions) |
| **February 2025** | Organizational session held |
| **2025-2027** | Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee drafting |
| **Late 2027** | Expected vote on final convention |

### 2. Why This Matters

**Shift from OECD to UN leadership:**
- Developing countries seek more inclusive forum
- OECD perceived as dominated by developed country interests
- UN has universal membership (193 states vs OECD's 38)
- Creates potential competing standard to OECD-led initiatives

**Opposition from developed countries:**
- US, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada voted against
- Concerns about duplication with OECD work
- Worry about impact on existing BEPS/Pillar frameworks
- 46 abstentions (mainly developed countries)

### 3. Scope and Implications

The Framework Convention is expected to address:
- Tax base erosion and profit shifting
- Tax evasion and illicit financial flows
- Environmental taxation
- Wealth and property taxation
- Digital economy challenges

```
EXAM TIP: UN Framework Convention
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is an EMERGING topic likely to appear in future exams.

Key points to remember:
1. Represents developing countries' desire for more voice
2. Creates tension with OECD-led initiatives (BEPS, Pillar Two)
3. If adopted, would be first binding multilateral tax convention
4. Negotiations ongoing through 2027

For current exams: Demonstrate awareness of this development
when discussing international tax governance.

Do NOT overstate its current impact—it is still under negotiation.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 6. UN Capacity Building and Technical Assistance

### 1. UN Role in Developing Country Support

Beyond model conventions, the UN supports developing countries through:

**Practical resources:**
- UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries
- Handbook on Selected Issues for Taxation of the Extractive Industries
- Toolkit on Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data
- Model Competent Authority Agreement on Information Exchange

**Capacity building:**
- Regional workshops on treaty negotiation
- Training on transfer pricing
- Technical assistance missions
- Online resources and e-learning

### 2. Platform for Collaboration on Tax

The **Platform for Collaboration on Tax** coordinates efforts among four institutions:
- IMF (International Monetary Fund)
- OECD
- UN
- World Bank

**Purpose:**
- Avoid duplication in technical assistance
- Develop joint toolkits
- Coordinate capacity building
- Present unified guidance on emerging issues

## 7. Comparative Analysis: OECD vs UN Approaches

### Summary Comparison Table

| Aspect | OECD Model | UN Model |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Primary constituency** | 38 developed countries | 193 UN member states |
| **Philosophy** | Residence-based | Source-based |
| **PE threshold** | 12-month construction | 6-month construction |
| **Services PE** | No general provision | 183-day services PE |
| **Royalties (Art 12)** | Exclusive residence | Source may tax |
| **Technical services** | Art 7 (PE required) | Art 12A (no PE needed) |
| **Digital services** | Pillar One (pending) | Art 12B (available now) |
| **Shipping** | Exclusive residence | Alternative B allows source |
| **Resources** | Extensive secretariat | Limited resources |
| **Updates** | Frequent | Less frequent |

### When to Apply Which Model

```
EXAM STRATEGY: Choosing Between Models
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ALWAYS state which Model applies (or is more relevant) when:

OECD Model more likely when:
✓ Both parties are OECD members
✓ Question references "OECD Model" or "MTC 2017"
✓ Developed-developed country treaty
✓ Focus on residence state rights

UN Model more likely when:
✓ One party is developing country
✓ Question references "UN Model"
✓ Focus on source country rights
✓ Technical services or digital services at issue
✓ African, Asian, or Latin American country involved

HYBRID approach when:
✓ Real treaty between developed and developing country
✓ Need to analyse which provisions apply
✓ Question asks about treaty negotiation strategy

## 9. Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Treating UN and OECD as identical | Misses fundamental policy differences | Always distinguish source vs residence orientation |
| Ignoring Art 12A/12B | These are key UN innovations | Reference when services or digital economy at issue |
| Overstating UN influence | Most treaties still OECD-based | Acknowledge UN as alternative, not replacement |
| Missing developing country perspective | Shows incomplete understanding | Explain WHY developing countries prefer UN provisions |
| Confusing Committee structure | Undermines institutional analysis | UN = 25 personal experts; OECD = government delegates |
