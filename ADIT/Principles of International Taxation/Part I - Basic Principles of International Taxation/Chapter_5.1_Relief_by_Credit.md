## A. THE CREDIT METHOD: CONCEPT AND OPERATION

### 1. Article 23B OECD Model Tax Convention

The credit method represents one of the two primary mechanisms through which states eliminate international double taxation. Article 23B of the OECD Model Tax Convention establishes the framework:

> "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall allow as a **deduction from the tax on the income or capital** of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in that other State."

The credit method embodies a fundamentally different philosophy from the exemption method. Rather than excluding foreign income from the tax base, the residence state includes worldwide income in its tax calculation but then allows a credit—a direct offset against tax liability—for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This approach reflects a belief that the residence state should maintain policy control over the effective tax burden of its residents, while still preventing the injustice of double taxation.

The historical development of the credit method traces to the United States, which adopted foreign tax credits as early as 1918. American policymakers were concerned that exempting foreign income would create powerful incentives for capital to flow abroad to lower-tax jurisdictions, eroding the domestic tax base and potentially distorting investment decisions. The credit method solved this by ensuring that American taxpayers would never face a lower effective rate on foreign income than on domestic income—the source country could tax first, but the US would "top up" to its own rate.

This approach has profound implications. Under the credit method, the residence state effectively asserts primacy over its residents' tax burden. It acknowledges that source states have legitimate claims to tax income arising within their borders, but refuses to allow these claims to reduce its residents' effective rate below the domestic level. For high-tax residence countries, this preserves revenue that would otherwise be lost to lower-tax jurisdictions.

### 2. How the Credit Method Works

The credit method operates through a systematic process that candidates must be able to apply in calculations:

```
CREDIT METHOD OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Taxpayer resident in Country R earns:
  • Domestic income: €200,000
  • Foreign income from Country S: €100,000
  • Country R tax rate: 40%
  • Country S tax rate: 25%

STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION:

Step 1: Calculate tax on WORLDWIDE income
        Total income: €300,000
        Country R tax (40%): €120,000

Step 2: Determine foreign tax paid
        Country S tax: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000

Step 3: Apply credit limitation
        Maximum credit = R's tax on foreign income
        = €100,000 × 40% = €40,000
        Actual foreign tax: €25,000
        Credit allowed: €25,000 (lower amount)

Step 4: Calculate final liability
        Country R tax: €120,000 - €25,000 = €95,000
        Country S tax: €25,000
        TOTAL TAX: €120,000

RESULT: Effective rate = 40% (residence state rate)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The key insight from this calculation is that when the source state rate is lower than the residence state rate, the taxpayer ends up paying the residence state rate through the "top-up" mechanism. The credit eliminates double taxation but ensures the residence state collects the difference between foreign tax and its own rate. This is precisely what credit-method countries intend—they view this as protecting their tax base while providing relief.

### 3. The Credit Limitation: Ordinary vs Full Credit

The distinction between ordinary (limited) credit and full (unlimited) credit is fundamental to understanding the credit method:

**Ordinary Credit (Standard)**:
Under the ordinary credit, the credit is capped at the residence state's own tax on the foreign income. This prevents the residence state from effectively subsidizing high-tax foreign countries.

**Full Credit (Rare)**:
Under full credit, the entire foreign tax would be creditable regardless of the residence state rate. This is rarely used because it could result in the residence state bearing a net cost when foreign rates exceed domestic rates.

```
ORDINARY VS FULL CREDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Higher foreign tax rate
  • Foreign income: €100,000
  • Country R rate: 25%
  • Country S rate: 40%

ORDINARY CREDIT (Limited):
  R's tax on foreign income: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000
  S tax paid: €100,000 × 40% = €40,000
  Credit allowed: €25,000 (limited to R's tax)
  Excess credit: €15,000 (lost or carried forward)
  Total tax: €40,000
  Effective rate: 40% (source state rate)

FULL CREDIT (Unlimited):
  Credit allowed: €40,000 (full foreign tax)
  R tax: €25,000 - €40,000 = -€15,000 (refund?)
  This would effectively subsidize Country S
  → Almost never used in practice
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The credit limitation exists for a compelling policy reason: without it, a residence state could find itself effectively subsidizing high-tax foreign countries. If a taxpayer earns income in a 50% tax jurisdiction and the residence state rate is 30%, unlimited credit would mean the residence state refunds the 20% difference—transferring its own revenue to compensate for another country's tax choices. No country willingly accepts this position.

**Exam Key Point**: Under the ordinary credit method:
- If foreign rate < domestic rate: credit fully utilized, taxpayer "tops up" to domestic rate
- If foreign rate > domestic rate: excess credit lost (or carried forward if permitted)
- If foreign rate = domestic rate: credit equals tax, no top-up needed

## B. DIRECT CREDIT (BASIC FOREIGN TAX CREDIT)

### 1. When Direct Credit Applies

The direct credit is the simplest form of foreign tax credit and applies when a taxpayer directly pays tax to a foreign jurisdiction on their own income. The elegance of the direct credit lies in its straightforward logic: you paid tax abroad, so you receive credit at home.

Direct credit applies across various income types:

| Income Type | Source State Tax | Credit Available |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Employment income** | Tax withheld or assessed in work country | Credit for employment tax |
| **Branch profits** | Tax on branch operations | Credit for branch profits tax |
| **Rental income** | Tax on property income in situs state | Credit for property income tax |
| **Dividends received** | Withholding tax on gross dividend | Credit for WHT |
| **Interest/Royalties** | Withholding tax | Credit for WHT |

The critical requirement is that the taxpayer must have **directly borne** the foreign tax liability. This distinguishes direct credit from indirect credit, where the tax was paid by a separate legal entity such as a subsidiary. When a UK company operates a branch in Australia and pays Australian tax on branch profits, that is direct credit territory. When the same UK company receives a dividend from an Australian subsidiary, the Australian corporate tax was paid by the subsidiary—a different legal person—requiring different analysis.

### 2. Direct Credit Calculation Example

**Scenario**: Maria, a UK resident individual, earns £50,000 employment income in Australia during a temporary assignment. Australian tax of £12,500 (25%) was withheld. Maria's UK marginal rate is 40%.

```
DIRECT CREDIT CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: UK tax on foreign income
        £50,000 × 40% = £20,000

Step 2: Foreign tax paid (directly by Maria)
        Australian tax = £12,500

Step 3: Credit limitation
        Maximum credit = UK tax on foreign income = £20,000
        Actual foreign tax = £12,500
        Credit allowed = £12,500 (lower amount)

Step 4: UK tax liability
        UK tax before credit: £20,000
        Less: Foreign tax credit: (£12,500)
        UK tax payable: £7,500

Step 5: Total tax burden
        Australia: £12,500
        UK (top-up): £7,500
        Total: £20,000 (effective rate 40%)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This calculation illustrates how the credit method operates to preserve the residence state's tax rate as the effective minimum. Maria pays 25% to Australia and "tops up" another 15% to the UK, resulting in the UK's 40% rate applying overall. Australia's lower rate provides no net benefit under the credit method—the UK captures the difference.

## C. INDIRECT CREDIT (UNDERLYING TAX CREDIT)

### 1. The Problem Indirect Credit Solves

The development of indirect credit represents one of the more sophisticated solutions in international tax policy. When a parent company receives dividends from a foreign subsidiary, two layers of tax have typically been paid:

| Layer | Tax Paid By | Nature |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Layer 1** | Subsidiary | Corporate tax on profits |
| **Layer 2** | Parent | WHT on dividend + residence state tax |

The direct credit only relieves Layer 2—the withholding tax actually suffered by the parent. It does not address Layer 1—the underlying corporate tax paid by the subsidiary on the profits from which dividends are distributed.

Why does this matter? Consider a multinational that operates abroad through either a branch or a subsidiary. If it uses a branch, the parent pays tax directly on branch profits and receives full credit. If it uses a subsidiary, the subsidiary pays corporate tax, and when dividends flow to the parent, direct credit only covers the WHT. The underlying corporate tax receives no relief, creating what economists call "economic double taxation"—the same economic income taxed twice.

This asymmetry would distort organizational choices if left unaddressed. Companies would structure inefficiently, perhaps using branches where subsidiaries would be commercially preferable, purely to minimize taxes. The economic substance of earning profits abroad is identical whether done through a branch or subsidiary; the tax system should not penalize one form arbitrarily.

```
THE UNDERLYING TAX PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    SUBSIDIARY (Country S)
    ────────────────────────
    Pre-tax profits:        €1,000,000
    Corporate tax (25%):    (€250,000)  ← Layer 1: Underlying tax
    ────────────────────────
    After-tax profits:      €750,000

    Dividend declared:      €750,000
    WHT (15%):             (€112,500)   ← Layer 2: Direct tax
    ────────────────────────
    Net dividend received:  €637,500

    PARENT (Country R - 30% rate)
    ────────────────────────
    Dividend income:        €750,000 (gross)
    R tax (30%):            €225,000

    WITHOUT INDIRECT CREDIT:
    Direct credit (WHT only): (€112,500)
    Tax payable in R:          €112,500

    TOTAL TAX: €250,000 + €112,500 + €112,500 = €475,000
    Effective rate: 47.5%  ← EXCESSIVE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. How Indirect Credit Works

The indirect credit allows the parent company to claim credit not just for WHT, but also for a proportion of the subsidiary's corporate tax attributable to the dividend received:

```
INDIRECT CREDIT FORMULA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                              Dividend Received
Underlying Tax Credit = ─────────────────────────── × Corporate Tax
                        Profits After Corporate Tax

Using the example above:
                         €750,000
Underlying Tax Credit = ────────── × €250,000 = €250,000
                         €750,000

TOTAL CREDIT AVAILABLE:
Direct credit (WHT):        €112,500
Indirect credit (Corp tax): €250,000
                           ─────────
Total potential credit:    €362,500

BUT: Credit limited to R's tax on grossed-up dividend
Grossed-up dividend: €750,000 + €250,000 = €1,000,000
R's tax: €1,000,000 × 30% = €300,000
Credit allowed: €300,000 (limited)
Excess credit: €62,500 (carried forward)

Tax payable in R: €0 (after credit)
Total tax: €250,000 + €112,500 = €362,500
Effective rate: 36.25%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The "grossing up" of the dividend is essential to the indirect credit calculation. The parent is treated as if it received not the net dividend but the full pre-tax profits attributable to its shareholding. This ensures that the credit limitation is calculated on a comparable basis—otherwise the credit could exceed the residence state tax on the actual dividend received, which would be inappropriate.

### 3. Conditions for Indirect Credit

Indirect credit is typically subject to qualifying conditions:

| Condition | Typical Threshold | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Minimum shareholding** | 10-25% of voting shares | Ensure substantial economic connection |
| **Direct holding** | Parent must directly own subsidiary | Administrative clarity |
| **Dividend actually paid** | Not available for retained profits | Timing principle |
| **Tax actually paid** | By subsidiary (not tax spared) | Reality principle |
| **Treaty provision** | Must be in treaty or domestic law | Legal basis |

The minimum shareholding requirement deserves particular attention. A portfolio investor holding 2% of a foreign company does not receive indirect credit—only direct credit for any WHT. This reflects a policy judgment that small shareholders lack the economic integration with the company that justifies treating them and the company as a single unit for credit purposes. The 10-25% threshold roughly corresponds to what tax systems consider a "substantial" or "controlling" interest.

### 4. Multi-Tier Indirect Credit

Some countries extend indirect credit through multiple tiers of subsidiaries:

```
MULTI-TIER STRUCTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    PARENT (Country R)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 1 (Country A)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 2 (Country B)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 3 (Country C) ← Operating company earning profits

US (pre-2017): Indirect credit through 6 tiers
UK: Generally direct subsidiaries only
Many countries: Limited to 2-3 tiers
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The US historically allowed six tiers of look-through, reflecting complex multinational structures. However, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's move to participation exemption for most foreign dividends largely eliminated indirect credit for US shareholders, replacing credit complexity with territorial simplicity.

## D. TAX SPARING CREDITS

### 1. The Concept and Its Historical Context

Tax sparing represents perhaps the most controversial credit mechanism in international taxation. It emerged from development economics debates of the 1960s and 1970s, when newly independent nations sought to attract foreign investment through tax incentives, only to discover that the credit method in investors' home countries neutralized these incentives entirely.

The problem is elegant in its cruelty. Country S, a developing nation, offers a ten-year tax holiday to attract manufacturing investment. Under normal credit rules, Country R (the investor's residence) taxes worldwide income and allows credit only for taxes actually paid. When the investor pays zero tax in Country S due to the holiday, no credit is available. Country R collects its full tax, and the investor receives no benefit from Country S's sacrifice.

```
TAX INCENTIVE "CLAW-BACK" PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Developing Country S offers 10-year tax holiday
  Normal S rate: 30%
  Country R (investor residence) rate: 35%

WITHOUT TAX SPARING:
─────────────────────
Income in S:            $1,000,000
S tax (holiday):        $0
R tax on worldwide:     $350,000
Credit for S tax:       $0 (none paid)
─────────────────────────────────
Final tax in R:         $350,000

RESULT:
  • Country S loses revenue (holiday)
  • Investor gets NO benefit
  • Country R captures the entire benefit
  • Investment incentive completely negated
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This outcome troubled development economists. Country S was sacrificing revenue to attract investment, but the fiscal benefit simply transferred to Country R's treasury rather than to the investor. The developing country bore all the cost; the developed country reaped all the reward. For newly independent nations, this seemed like yet another instance of the international economic system favoring wealthy nations.

### 2. How Tax Sparing Works

Tax sparing allows a credit for tax that **would have been paid** absent the incentive:

```
TAX SPARING SOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITH TAX SPARING:
─────────────────────
Income in S:                $1,000,000
S tax (holiday):            $0
S tax that WOULD have been paid: $300,000 (30% normal rate)

R tax on worldwide:         $350,000
Tax sparing credit:         $300,000 (deemed tax)
─────────────────────────────────────
Final tax in R:             $50,000

RESULT:
  • Investor benefits: $250,000 tax saving
  • Country S achieves investment attraction goal
  • Country R bears cost of preserving incentive
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

What has happened here is remarkable: Country R has agreed to sacrifice its own revenue to support Country S's development policy. This is international cooperation in action—or, depending on perspective, an inappropriate subsidy to investors in low-tax jurisdictions.

### 3. Arguments For and Against Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has always been contentious, reflecting deeper disagreements about the relationship between developed and developing countries in the international tax system:

| Arguments FOR | Arguments AGAINST |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Preserves developing country incentives | Creates revenue loss for residence states |
| Promotes international investment | May subsidize inefficient investment |
| Supports development goals | Encourages tax holidays (often poor policy) |
| Recognized by UN Model | Can be abused through aggressive planning |
| Historical use by major economies | Difficult to administer and verify |

Supporters argue that developing countries have the sovereign right to use tax policy as a development tool, and residence states should not undermine these choices. Without tax sparing, developing countries face a harsh dilemma: either set rates high enough that investors get no benefit from incentives, or set rates at zero so investors keep all benefits—neither option may be optimal.

Critics counter that tax sparing distorts investment decisions, encouraging projects that make sense only because of the tax benefit rather than genuine economic merit. The OECD and IMF have documented how tax holidays can create distortions, encourage rent-seeking, and erode the tax base without delivering promised investment benefits.

### 4. The Decline of Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has become less common in modern treaty practice:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **OECD skepticism** | 1998 OECD Report questioned effectiveness |
| **BEPS concerns** | Tax sparing can facilitate BEPS structures |
| **Territorial systems** | Many countries now exempt foreign income |
| **Harmful tax practices** | Incentives subject to FHTP review |
| **US policy** | US has never granted tax sparing |
| **Pillar Two** | 15% minimum tax undermines incentive rationale |

The 1998 OECD Report on Tax Sparing marked a turning point, finding limited evidence that tax sparing influenced investment decisions and documenting abuse cases. The BEPS project accelerated the decline—it became intellectually untenable to advocate against harmful tax competition while supporting tax sparing for similar regimes.

**Current Status**: Tax sparing survives in older treaties, some Asian treaties with developing partners, and UK treaties with certain Commonwealth nations. New treaties rarely include it, and existing provisions are often removed during renegotiation.

## E. CREDIT LIMITATIONS AND BASKETS

### 1. Overall vs Per-Country Limitation

Countries using the credit method must choose how to calculate the limitation when taxpayers have income from multiple foreign sources:

```
LIMITATION APPROACHES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Taxpayer earns income in two foreign countries
          Home rate: 30%

          Country A: €100,000 income, 40% tax = €40,000
          Country B: €100,000 income, 10% tax = €10,000

OVERALL LIMITATION:
───────────────────
Total foreign income: €200,000
Home tax on foreign income: €200,000 × 30% = €60,000
Total foreign tax: €50,000
Credit allowed: €50,000 (within overall limit)
→ High and low tax countries averaged ("cross-crediting")

PER-COUNTRY LIMITATION:
───────────────────────
Country A: Limit €30,000, tax €40,000 → Credit €30,000, excess €10,000
Country B: Limit €30,000, tax €10,000 → Credit €10,000
Total credit: €40,000
→ Excess credits cannot offset low-tax income capacity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Overall limitation allows "cross-crediting"—excess credits from high-tax countries offset surplus capacity from low-tax countries. Per-country limitation prevents this, ensuring each country's investment faces at least the residence rate.

### 2. The US Basket System

The US uses a sophisticated basket system to prevent cross-crediting within income categories:

| Basket | Income Types | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Passive** | Dividends, interest, royalties, rents | Prevent sheltering passive with active |
| **General** | Active business income | Prevent mixing |
| **GILTI** | Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income | 80% credit only |
| **Branch** | Branch profits | Separate treatment |

### 3. Excess Credit Carryover

When foreign tax exceeds the limitation:

| Treatment | Countries |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Carry forward** | UK (unlimited), US (10 years), most OECD |
| **Carry back** | US (1 year), some others |
| **Lost** | Some developing countries |

## F. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLE

### Direct and Indirect Credit Calculation (15 marks)

**Scenario**:

UKCo holds 100% of GermanCo. GermanCo earns €4,000,000 pre-tax profits, pays €1,200,000 corporate tax (30%), and distributes €2,100,000 as dividend. Germany levies 5% WHT (€105,000). UK corporate rate is 25%.

**Required**:
(a) Calculate UKCo's UK tax position with direct credit only (5 marks)
(b) Calculate UKCo's position with indirect (underlying) credit (5 marks)
(c) Explain the policy rationale for indirect credit (5 marks)

**Model Answer**:

**(a) Direct Credit Only (5 marks)**

```
Step 1: GermanCo's position
Pre-tax profits:                 €4,000,000
German corporate tax (30%):      (€1,200,000)
After-tax profits:               €2,800,000
Dividend declared:               €2,100,000

Step 2: WHT on dividend
Gross dividend:                  €2,100,000
WHT (5%):                       (€105,000)
Net dividend received:           €1,995,000

Step 3: UKCo's tax liability
Taxable dividend income:         €2,100,000
UK tax (25%):                    €525,000
Direct credit (WHT only):       (€105,000)
Tax payable in UK:               €420,000

Total tax burden:
GermanCo tax (attributable): €1,200,000 × (2,100/2,800) = €900,000
WHT:                         €105,000
UKCo tax:                    €420,000
Total:                       €1,425,000

Effective rate: 47.5% ← Economic double taxation
```

**(b) With Indirect Credit (5 marks)**

```
Step 1: Calculate underlying tax
Underlying tax = (Dividend / After-tax profits) × Corporate tax
               = (€2,100,000 / €2,800,000) × €1,200,000
               = €900,000

Step 2: Total credit available
Direct credit (WHT):             €105,000
Indirect credit (underlying):    €900,000
Total potential credit:          €1,005,000

Step 3: Credit limitation
Grossed-up dividend: €2,100,000 + €900,000 = €3,000,000
UK tax on gross-up: €3,000,000 × 25% = €750,000
Credit allowed: €750,000 (limited)
Excess credit: €255,000 (carried forward)

Step 4: Tax payable
UK tax:                          €750,000
Less credit:                    (€750,000)
Tax payable in UK:               €0

Total tax: €900,000 + €105,000 = €1,005,000
Effective rate: 33.5%
```

**(c) Policy Rationale (5 marks)**

Indirect credit addresses **economic double taxation** arising when corporate profits are taxed at both subsidiary level and again when distributed as dividends.

**Key justifications**:

1. **Economic integration**: Parent and subsidiary form an economic unit; taxing the same profits twice creates excessive burden that discourages cross-border investment.

2. **Organizational neutrality**: Without indirect credit, branch structures would be tax-favored over subsidiaries, distorting business organization decisions.

3. **Capital export neutrality**: The credit method aims to ensure same effective rate regardless of investment location; without indirect credit, this neutrality is compromised for subsidiary structures.

**Limitations**: Indirect credit is administratively complex, requiring verification of foreign accounts and minimum shareholding requirements to define qualifying relationships.

2. DIRECT CREDIT:
   • Credit for tax paid directly by taxpayer
   • Applies to: employment, branch profits, WHT
   • Limited to residence state's tax on foreign income

3. INDIRECT CREDIT:
   • Credit for underlying corporate tax on dividends
