## Chapter 5.1: Relief by Credit – Including Indirect/Underlying Credit and Tax Sparing Credit

### 1. The Credit Method: Concept and Operation

The credit method represents one of the two primary mechanisms through which states eliminate international double taxation. Where the exemption method excludes foreign income from the domestic tax base entirely, the credit method takes a fundamentally different approach: it includes worldwide income in the residence state's tax base but allows the taxpayer to offset foreign taxes paid against domestic tax liability. This approach reflects a policy choice that the residence state should maintain oversight of its residents' total tax burden while still preventing the injustice of double taxation.

The historical development of the credit method traces primarily to the United States, which adopted foreign tax credits as early as 1918. American policymakers were concerned that exempting foreign income would create powerful incentives for capital to flow abroad to lower-tax jurisdictions, eroding the domestic tax base and potentially distorting investment decisions. The credit method addressed this concern by ensuring that taxpayers would never face a lower effective rate on foreign income than on domestic income—the source country could tax first, but the residence country would collect any difference between its rate and the foreign rate.

#### 1.1. Article 23B OECD Model Tax Convention

Article 23B of the OECD Model Tax Convention establishes the treaty framework for the credit method. The provision states that where a resident of a contracting state derives income which, in accordance with the treaty provisions, may be taxed in the other contracting state, the residence state shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the source state. This deduction represents a credit—a direct offset against tax liability rather than a reduction in taxable income.

The credit operates subject to a fundamental limitation: it cannot exceed that part of the income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in the source state. This limitation, commonly termed the ordinary credit limitation, prevents the residence state from effectively subsidising high-tax foreign countries by refunding more tax than it would have collected on the foreign income itself.

#### 1.2. How the Credit Method Works

The credit method operates through a systematic process. The residence state first includes all worldwide income—both domestic and foreign—in the tax base and calculates tax on this total amount at domestic rates. It then determines the foreign tax actually paid on foreign-source income and compares this to the residence state's own tax on that foreign income. The taxpayer receives a credit for the lesser of these two amounts.

The key outcome is that the taxpayer pays the higher of the source or residence state tax rate. When the source state rate is lower than the residence state rate, the credit fully offsets the foreign tax and the residence state collects the difference—a mechanism often described as a "top-up" to the residence rate. When the source state rate exceeds the residence state rate, the credit is limited to the residence state's tax on that income, leaving the taxpayer with an effective rate equal to the higher foreign rate.

Consider a UK resident company earning profits in a country imposing a 15% tax rate while the UK rate is 25%. The company pays 15% to the source country, the UK taxes worldwide income at 25%, and credit is given for the 15% foreign tax, leaving the UK to collect the remaining 10%. The total effective rate equals the UK rate of 25%. Conversely, if the foreign rate were 30%, the credit would be limited to 25% of the foreign income, leaving the taxpayer bearing the full 30% foreign rate with 5% unreleved.

#### 1.3. The Credit Limitation

The distinction between ordinary credit and full credit is fundamental to understanding how the credit method operates in practice. Under ordinary credit—the standard approach reflected in Article 23B and employed by virtually all countries—the credit is capped at the residence state's own tax on the foreign income. Without this limitation, a residence state could find itself effectively subsidising high-tax foreign jurisdictions by refunding the difference between foreign tax paid and domestic tax that would have been due.

The policy rationale is straightforward: if a taxpayer earns income in a jurisdiction imposing a 50% tax rate while the residence state rate is 30%, unlimited credit would require the residence state to refund the 20% excess—transferring its own revenue to compensate for another country's tax policy choices. The ordinary credit prevents this outcome while still eliminating double taxation up to the residence state's own rate.

Full credit, which would provide credit for the entire foreign tax regardless of the residence state rate, remains almost entirely theoretical. Virtually no country employs it in practice due to the obvious revenue implications.

### 2. Direct Credit

#### 2.1. When Direct Credit Applies

Direct credit—also termed basic foreign tax credit—applies in the straightforward situation where a taxpayer directly pays tax to a foreign jurisdiction on their own income. The logic is simple: you paid tax abroad on your income, so you receive credit at home.

This category encompasses employment income subject to tax in the country where services are performed, branch profits taxed in the country where the branch operates, rental income from property subject to tax in the situs state, and withholding taxes suffered on dividends, interest, or royalties received from foreign sources. The critical requirement is that the taxpayer must have directly borne the foreign tax liability—the tax must have been imposed on and paid by the taxpayer themselves rather than by a separate legal entity.

This requirement distinguishes direct credit from indirect credit. When a UK company operates a branch in Australia and pays Australian corporate tax on branch profits, direct credit applies because the UK company itself paid the tax. When the same UK company receives a dividend from an Australian subsidiary, however, the Australian corporate tax was paid by the subsidiary—a separate legal person—and direct credit covers only any withholding tax on the dividend itself, not the underlying corporate tax paid by the subsidiary.

#### 2.2. Taxes Qualifying for Credit

Not all foreign levies qualify for foreign tax credit. The charge must generally be an income tax or a tax substantially similar to an income tax. This requirement connects Article 23B relief to Article 2 of the OECD Model, which defines the taxes covered by the treaty.

Qualifying characteristics typically include imposition on net income after deductions, a compulsory levy not linked to specific government services, and substantial similarity to the residence state's own income tax. Charges that fail these tests—gross receipts taxes without deductions, social security contributions, transaction taxes, stamp duties, and similar levies—generally do not qualify for credit relief.

This distinction becomes particularly significant when new types of levies emerge. Digital services taxes calculated on gross revenues present a contemporary example of the challenges in determining whether novel charges qualify for foreign tax credit. The question turns on whether such levies can properly be characterised as taxes on income or elements of income for treaty purposes—an issue that requires careful analysis of both the levy's design and its relationship to Article 2 coverage (covered in June 2025).

### 3. Indirect Credit (Underlying Tax Credit)

#### 3.1. The Problem Indirect Credit Solves

When a parent company receives dividends from a foreign subsidiary, two layers of tax have typically been imposed on the same underlying profits. The subsidiary pays corporate tax on its profits in the source country, and when those after-tax profits are distributed as dividends, the parent may suffer withholding tax on the dividend payment. Direct credit covers only the withholding tax—the tax directly suffered by the parent on receipt of the dividend.

The underlying corporate tax, however, represents a significant economic burden on the same profits. Without relief for this underlying tax, the choice between operating abroad through a branch or through a subsidiary would be distorted by tax considerations. Branch profits would receive full credit because the parent pays tax directly, while subsidiary profits distributed as dividends would receive credit only for withholding tax, leaving the underlying corporate tax unreleved. This asymmetry would encourage inefficient structuring—using branches where subsidiaries would be commercially preferable—purely to minimise the combined tax burden.

#### 3.2. How Indirect Credit Works

Indirect credit—also termed underlying tax credit—allows the parent company to claim credit not just for withholding tax suffered on the dividend but also for a proportion of the subsidiary's corporate tax attributable to the dividend received. The concept treats the parent as having constructively borne a share of the subsidiary's tax corresponding to the profits distributed.

The calculation typically involves determining the proportion of the subsidiary's after-tax profits represented by the dividend and applying this proportion to the subsidiary's corporate tax. If a subsidiary with post-tax profits of 80 (having paid corporate tax of 20 on pre-tax profits of 100) distributes a dividend of 40, the parent is treated as having borne half of the corporate tax—10—in addition to any withholding tax on the dividend itself.

A critical element of indirect credit calculations is the gross-up mechanism. The residence state treats the parent as having received not just the net dividend but the pre-tax profits represented by that dividend. This grossed-up amount becomes the foreign income for purposes of both taxation and the credit limitation, ensuring consistent treatment of the combined direct and indirect credit against the residence state's tax on the underlying profits.

#### 3.3. Conditions for Indirect Credit

Indirect credit is typically available only where substantial ownership exists between parent and subsidiary. Minimum shareholding thresholds—commonly 10% to 25% of voting shares—ensure that the mechanism applies to genuine parent-subsidiary relationships rather than portfolio investments. This reflects a policy judgment that small shareholders lack the economic integration with the subsidiary that would justify treating them and the subsidiary as a single economic unit for credit purposes.

Additional conditions commonly include requirements that the parent directly holds the shares in the subsidiary, that dividends have actually been paid rather than merely being retained profits, and that the underlying tax was actually paid by the subsidiary rather than merely notionally credited. The legal basis for indirect credit must be found either in domestic law or in treaty provisions—it does not arise automatically from the treaty credit mechanism.

#### 3.4. Developments: The Shift Toward Participation Exemption

A significant development in the treatment of foreign subsidiary dividends came with the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017, which largely replaced indirect credit with participation exemption for qualifying dividends received by US corporate shareholders. Prior to this reform, US multinationals operated under a worldwide taxation system with complex multi-tier indirect credit calculations extending through chains of subsidiaries up to six levels deep.

The 2017 reform introduced a 100% dividends received deduction for qualifying foreign dividends, effectively exempting such income from US tax entirely. This eliminated the need for indirect credit calculations—where income is exempt, no credit is required. The US thus joined the majority of developed countries in providing participation exemption for qualifying foreign dividends, though it simultaneously introduced new anti-deferral regimes including the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions.

This global trend toward participation exemption for inter-company dividends—discussed further in Chapter 5.2—has reduced the practical significance of indirect credit in many contexts, though the concept remains important where exemption systems do not apply or where conditions for participation exemption are not satisfied.

### 4. Tax Sparing Credits

#### 4.1. The Concept and Historical Context

Tax sparing represents perhaps the most controversial credit mechanism in international taxation. The concept emerged from development economics debates of the 1960s and 1970s, when newly independent nations sought to attract foreign investment through tax incentives such as tax holidays, reduced rates, and accelerated depreciation. These countries discovered, however, that the credit method in investors' home countries often neutralised the intended benefits of their incentives entirely.

The problem was straightforward: if a developing country offered a tax holiday reducing its effective rate to zero while the investor's home country imposed a 35% rate, the home country would tax the foreign income at 35% with no credit available (since no foreign tax was actually paid). The developing country sacrificed revenue to attract investment, but the investor received no benefit—the home country captured the entire tax saving. This outcome frustrated the developing country's policy objectives while providing an unintended windfall to the home country treasury.

#### 4.2. How Tax Sparing Works

Tax sparing addresses this problem by allowing the residence state to provide credit for tax that would have been paid in the source country absent the incentive. If the source country's normal rate is 30% but a tax holiday reduces the actual tax to zero, tax sparing allows the residence state to credit the 30% deemed tax rather than the zero actually paid. This preserves the benefit of the source country's incentive for the investor while shifting the cost to the residence country.

The mechanism requires explicit treaty provision—tax sparing does not arise from the ordinary credit article. Treaties including tax sparing clauses typically specify the source country incentive regimes to which sparing applies and the deemed rates at which credit will be provided.

#### 4.3. Arguments For and Against Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has always been contentious, reflecting deeper disagreements about the international tax system's proper function. Proponents argue that tax sparing preserves developing countries' sovereign tax policy choices, promotes investment in developing economies, prevents residence states from "free-riding" on source country revenue sacrifices, and recognises legitimate development needs—a position reflected in the UN Model's more favourable treatment of tax sparing provisions.

Opponents contend that tax sparing creates revenue loss for residence states, may subsidise inefficient investment decisions that would not occur absent the distorting incentive, encourages tax holidays that are often poor policy even for developing countries, can be abused through aggressive planning structures, and proves difficult to administer and verify. The US position—that it has never granted tax sparing in any treaty—reflects these concerns.

#### 4.4. The Decline of Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has become substantially less common in modern treaty practice for several interconnected reasons. The 1998 OECD Report on Tax Sparing questioned its effectiveness, documenting limited evidence that tax sparing provisions influenced actual investment decisions while identifying abuse cases. The subsequent focus on base erosion and profit shifting concerns has created intellectual tension with tax sparing, which can facilitate rather than prevent BEPS structures.

The global trend toward territorial or exemption systems for foreign dividends has also reduced demand for tax sparing—where residence countries exempt foreign income entirely, the mechanism becomes unnecessary. Additionally, work on harmful tax practices through the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices has subjected investment incentives to review, creating awkwardness for treaty provisions designed to preserve the effectiveness of incentives that the FHTP might condemn.

Most significantly, the OECD/G20 Pillar Two rules imposing a 15% minimum effective tax rate on large multinational enterprises fundamentally undermine the rationale for both tax incentives and tax sparing. If a developing country offers a tax holiday reducing the effective rate below 15%, the multinational's home jurisdiction (or other group entities) may impose a top-up tax to reach the minimum rate. This negates the benefit of the holiday in much the same way that the credit method originally did—rendering tax sparing provisions largely pointless for in-scope enterprises while forcing developing countries to reconsider their incentive strategies entirely.

Tax sparing survives in older treaties, some Asian treaties with developing partners, and certain UK treaties with Commonwealth nations, but new treaties rarely include it and existing provisions are frequently removed during renegotiation.

### 5. Credit Limitations and Baskets

#### 5.1. Overall vs Per-Country Limitation

Countries employing the credit method must determine how to calculate the credit limitation when taxpayers derive income from multiple foreign sources. The overall limitation calculates a single limit based on total foreign income, while the per-country limitation calculates separate limits for each source jurisdiction.

The practical difference involves cross-crediting: under an overall limitation, excess credits from high-tax countries can offset spare capacity from low-tax countries. If a taxpayer earning equal amounts from a 40% jurisdiction and a 10% jurisdiction faces a home country rate of 25%, the overall limitation creates combined capacity of 25% on total foreign income. The excess credit from the high-tax source (40% minus 25% equals 15% excess) can utilise the spare capacity from the low-tax source (25% minus 10% equals 15% spare), resulting in full credit utilisation.

Per-country limitation prevents this averaging—each country's income must be considered separately, and excess credits from one cannot offset capacity from another. The taxpayer in the above example would have unreleved excess credits from the high-tax jurisdiction despite having capacity in the low-tax jurisdiction.

#### 5.2. The Basket System

The United States employs a sophisticated basket system that prevents cross-crediting not just between countries but between categories of income. Separate limitations apply to passive income (dividends, interest, royalties, rents), general income (active business income), GILTI income (subject to special rules allowing only 80% credit), and branch income. This system prevents taxpayers from sheltering lightly-taxed passive income using credits generated by active business operations in high-tax jurisdictions.

#### 5.3. Excess Credit Treatment

When foreign tax exceeds the applicable limitation, jurisdictions vary in their treatment of the excess. Most OECD countries permit excess credits to be carried forward—the UK allows unlimited carry-forward while the US permits ten years. Some jurisdictions also allow carry-back—the US permits one year. In certain developing countries, however, excess credits may simply be lost, resulting in permanent unrelieved double taxation to the extent the foreign rate exceeds the domestic rate.

### 6. Policy Considerations: Credit vs Exemption

The choice between credit and exemption methods reflects fundamental policy preferences about the appropriate relationship between residence and source taxation.

#### 6.1. Capital Export Neutrality vs Capital Import Neutrality

The credit method supports capital export neutrality—the principle that taxpayers should face the same effective tax rate regardless of where they invest. A resident investing domestically or abroad will ultimately bear at least the domestic rate, as the credit eliminates only the double taxation component and any excess foreign tax remains unreleved. This approach theoretically promotes efficient capital allocation by ensuring investment decisions are not distorted by tax considerations.

The exemption method supports capital import neutrality—the principle that all investors in a jurisdiction should face the same tax burden regardless of their residence. Exempt investors compete on equal footing with local enterprises and with other foreign investors whose home countries also exempt. This approach may enhance the competitiveness of resident multinationals in foreign markets by eliminating any home country tax burden on their foreign operations.

#### 6.2. Administrative and Practical Implications

The credit method imposes significant administrative burdens. Taxpayers must track foreign taxes paid, calculate limitations (potentially by basket and country), manage carryovers of excess credits, and ensure that foreign taxes qualify for credit. Tax authorities must verify foreign tax payments and police the boundary between creditable and non-creditable foreign charges.

The exemption method offers relative simplicity—qualifying foreign income is simply excluded from the tax base. This administrative advantage, combined with competitiveness considerations, has contributed to the global trend away from worldwide taxation with credit toward territorial systems with participation exemption. The credit method preserves residence state revenue by collecting any difference between domestic and foreign rates, but this benefit comes at substantial compliance cost and may disadvantage domestic multinationals competing against firms from exemption countries.

These policy trade-offs—between neutrality principles, revenue considerations, administrative burden, and international competitiveness—explain why countries continue to make different choices and why the international tax landscape features both approaches, often in combination within hybrid systems that apply credit to some income categories and exemption to others.
