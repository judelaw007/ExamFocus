## 1. The Credit Method: Concept and Operation

### 1.1. Article 23B OECD Model Tax Convention

The credit method represents one of the two primary mechanisms through which states eliminate international double taxation. Article 23B of the OECD Model Tax Convention establishes the framework:

> "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall allow as a **deduction from the tax on the income or capital** of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in that other State."

The credit method embodies a fundamentally different philosophy from the exemption method. Rather than excluding foreign income from the tax base, the residence state includes worldwide income in its tax calculation but then allows a credit—a direct offset against tax liability—for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This approach reflects a belief that the residence state should maintain policy control over the effective tax burden of its residents, while still preventing the injustice of double taxation.

The historical development of the credit method traces to the United States, which adopted foreign tax credits as early as 1918. American policymakers were concerned that exempting foreign income would create powerful incentives for capital to flow abroad to lower-tax jurisdictions, eroding the domestic tax base and potentially distorting investment decisions. The credit method solved this by ensuring that American taxpayers would never face a lower effective rate on foreign income than on domestic income—the source country could tax first, but the US would "top up" to its own rate.

### 1.2. How the Credit Method Works: Conceptual Framework

The credit method operates through a systematic process that ensures the taxpayer pays the **higher** of the source or residence state tax rate:

```
CREDIT METHOD: CONCEPTUAL OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Include worldwide income in residence state tax base
        → Foreign income is NOT excluded

STEP 2: Calculate residence state tax on worldwide income
        → Apply domestic rate to total income

STEP 3: Determine foreign tax actually paid
        → Tax paid to source state on foreign income

STEP 4: Apply credit limitation (ordinary credit)
        → Credit cannot exceed residence state's own tax
          on that foreign income

STEP 5: Deduct allowable credit from residence state tax
        → Results in "top-up" if foreign rate lower
        → Results in excess credit if foreign rate higher

KEY OUTCOME: Effective rate = HIGHER of source or residence rate
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Conceptual Example**: A UK resident company earns profits in a country with a 15% tax rate. The UK rate is 25%. Under the credit method:
- The company pays 15% to the source country
- The UK taxes the worldwide income at 25%
- Credit is given for the 15% foreign tax
- The UK collects the remaining 10% ("top-up")
- **Total effective rate: 25%** (the residence state rate)

The key insight is that when the source state rate is lower than the residence state rate, the taxpayer ends up paying the residence state rate through this "top-up" mechanism. The credit eliminates double taxation but ensures the residence state collects the difference.

### 1.3. The Credit Limitation: Ordinary vs Full Credit

The distinction between ordinary (limited) credit and full (unlimited) credit is fundamental:

| Feature | Ordinary Credit (Standard) | Full Credit (Rare) |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Limitation** | Capped at residence state's tax on foreign income | No cap—full foreign tax creditable |
| **Policy rationale** | Prevents residence state subsidizing high-tax countries | Maximum relief for taxpayer |
| **When foreign rate > domestic** | Excess credit lost or carried forward | Residence state effectively refunds difference |
| **Adoption** | OECD Model, most countries | Almost never used |

**Why the limitation exists**: Without it, a residence state could find itself effectively subsidizing high-tax foreign countries. If a taxpayer earns income in a 50% tax jurisdiction and the residence state rate is 30%, unlimited credit would require the residence state to refund the 20% difference—transferring its own revenue to compensate for another country's tax choices.

```
EXAM KEY POINT: Credit Limitation Outcomes
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If foreign rate < domestic rate:
  → Credit fully utilized
  → Taxpayer "tops up" to domestic rate
  → Effective rate = DOMESTIC rate

If foreign rate > domestic rate:
  → Excess credit (foreign tax minus domestic tax on that income)
  → Excess lost OR carried forward (if permitted)
  → Effective rate = FOREIGN rate (source state rate)

If foreign rate = domestic rate:
  → Credit equals residence tax
  → No top-up, no excess
  → Perfect elimination of double taxation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 2. Direct Credit (Basic Foreign Tax Credit)

### 2.1. When Direct Credit Applies

The direct credit is the simplest form of foreign tax credit and applies when a taxpayer **directly pays** tax to a foreign jurisdiction on their own income. The elegance of the direct credit lies in its straightforward logic: you paid tax abroad, so you receive credit at home.

| Income Type | Source State Tax | Credit Treatment |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Employment income** | Tax withheld or assessed in work country | Direct credit for employment tax |
| **Branch profits** | Tax on branch operations | Direct credit for branch profits tax |
| **Rental income** | Tax on property income in situs state | Direct credit for property income tax |
| **Dividends received** | Withholding tax on gross dividend | Direct credit for WHT only |
| **Interest/Royalties** | Withholding tax | Direct credit for WHT |

The critical requirement is that the taxpayer must have **directly borne** the foreign tax liability. This distinguishes direct credit from indirect credit, where the tax was paid by a separate legal entity such as a subsidiary.

**Conceptual distinction**: When a UK company operates a branch in Australia and pays Australian tax on branch profits, that is direct credit territory—the UK company itself paid the tax. When the same UK company receives a dividend from an Australian subsidiary, the Australian corporate tax was paid by the subsidiary—a different legal person—requiring indirect credit analysis.

### 2.2. Taxes Qualifying for Credit

Not all foreign charges qualify for foreign tax credit. The tax must generally be an **income tax** or tax **in lieu of** income tax. This connects to Article 2 of the OECD Model (Taxes Covered).

**Qualifying characteristics**:
- Imposed on net income (after deductions)
- Compulsory levy, not payment for specific benefit
- Substantially similar to residence state's income tax

**Non-qualifying charges** (generally):
- Gross receipts taxes without deductions
- Social security contributions (may vary)
- Transaction taxes, stamp duties
- Digital services taxes (contentious—see June 2025 exam)

This distinction becomes critical when new types of levies emerge. The June 2025 ADIT exam tested whether a "Market Presence Adjustment" (calculated on gross receipts, no deductions) would qualify for FTC—highlighting the ongoing relevance of determining what constitutes a creditable tax.

## 3. Indirect Credit (Underlying Tax Credit)

### 3.1. The Problem Indirect Credit Solves

When a parent company receives dividends from a foreign subsidiary, two layers of tax have typically been paid:

```
THE UNDERLYING TAX PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    SUBSIDIARY (Source Country)
    ────────────────────────────
    Earns profits
    Pays corporate tax          ← LAYER 1: Underlying tax
    Distributes dividend              (paid by SUBSIDIARY)
    WHT deducted on dividend    ← LAYER 2: Withholding tax
                                      (suffered by PARENT)

    PARENT (Residence Country)
    ────────────────────────────
    Receives net dividend
    Subject to residence tax

    WITHOUT INDIRECT CREDIT:
    • Direct credit covers WHT only (Layer 2)
    • Underlying corporate tax (Layer 1) gets NO relief
    • Same economic income taxed TWICE
    • Creates "economic double taxation"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Why this matters**: Consider a multinational that can operate abroad through either a branch or a subsidiary:
- **Branch**: Parent pays tax directly on branch profits → full credit available
- **Subsidiary**: Subsidiary pays corporate tax; parent only gets credit for WHT → underlying tax unreleved

This asymmetry would distort organizational choices if left unaddressed. Companies would structure inefficiently, using branches where subsidiaries would be commercially preferable, purely to minimize taxes.

### 3.2. How Indirect Credit Works: The Concept

Indirect credit allows the parent company to claim credit not just for WHT, but also for a **proportion** of the subsidiary's corporate tax attributable to the dividend received:

```
INDIRECT CREDIT: CONCEPTUAL FORMULA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                              Dividend Received
Underlying Tax Credit = ─────────────────────────── × Corporate Tax
                        Profits After Corporate Tax

KEY CONCEPTS:

1. PROPORTIONALITY: Credit reflects the portion of profits
   actually distributed, not total subsidiary tax

2. GROSS-UP: Parent treated as receiving pre-tax profits,
   not just net dividend (for limitation calculation)

3. TOTAL CREDIT: Direct (WHT) + Indirect (underlying) combined

4. LIMITATION STILL APPLIES: Total credit capped at residence
   state's tax on the grossed-up dividend
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.3. Conditions for Indirect Credit

Indirect credit is typically subject to qualifying conditions reflecting policy judgments about when parent-subsidiary relationships justify this treatment:

| Condition | Typical Threshold | Policy Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Minimum shareholding** | 10-25% of voting shares | Ensures substantial economic connection; portfolio investors excluded |
| **Direct holding** | Parent must directly own subsidiary | Administrative clarity and verification |
| **Dividend actually paid** | Not available for retained profits | Timing principle—relief when income realized |
| **Tax actually paid** | By subsidiary (not tax spared) | Reality principle—credit for real taxes |
| **Treaty or domestic law provision** | Must be expressly provided | Legal basis required |

The minimum shareholding requirement deserves attention. A portfolio investor holding 2% of a foreign company does not receive indirect credit—only direct credit for any WHT. This reflects a policy judgment that small shareholders lack the economic integration with the company that justifies treating them and the company as a single unit for credit purposes.

### 3.4. The US Shift: TCJA 2017 and Participation Exemption

A significant development in indirect credit came with the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017, which largely **replaced** indirect credit with participation exemption for US corporate shareholders:

| Pre-TCJA (before 2018) | Post-TCJA (2018 onwards) |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| US taxed worldwide dividends from foreign subsidiaries | 100% dividends received deduction for qualifying dividends |
| Indirect credit for underlying foreign taxes | No credit needed—income not taxed |
| Complex multi-tier credit calculations (up to 6 tiers) | Territorial approach for most dividends |
| Credit limitations, baskets, carryovers | Simplified (but GILTI introduced new complexity) |

This shift illustrates the global trend toward **participation exemption** (discussed in Chapter 5.2) as an alternative to indirect credit. Many countries now exempt qualifying dividends from foreign subsidiaries entirely, eliminating the need for complex indirect credit calculations.

## 4. Tax Sparing Credits

### 4.1. The Concept and Its Historical Context

Tax sparing represents perhaps the most controversial credit mechanism in international taxation. It emerged from development economics debates of the 1960s and 1970s, when newly independent nations sought to attract foreign investment through tax incentives, only to discover that the credit method in investors' home countries **neutralized these incentives entirely**.

```
THE TAX INCENTIVE "CLAW-BACK" PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Developing Country S offers 10-year tax holiday
          Normal S rate: 30%
          Country R (investor residence) rate: 35%

WITHOUT TAX SPARING:
────────────────────
• Investor pays 0% to Country S (holiday)
• Country R taxes worldwide income at 35%
• Credit available: $0 (no tax actually paid)
• Investor pays full 35% to Country R

RESULT:
• Country S LOSES revenue (sacrificed for investment)
• Investor gets NO benefit from the holiday
• Country R CAPTURES the entire tax saving
• Investment incentive COMPLETELY NEGATED

THE INJUSTICE: Developing country bears all cost;
              developed country reaps all reward
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.2. How Tax Sparing Works

Tax sparing allows a credit for tax that **would have been paid** absent the incentive:

```
TAX SPARING SOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITH TAX SPARING:
─────────────────
• Investor pays 0% to Country S (holiday)
• Country S's normal rate: 30%
• Country R allows credit for "deemed" 30% tax
• Country R taxes at 35%, credits 30%
• Investor pays only 5% to Country R

RESULT:
• Investor BENEFITS from the tax holiday
• Country S achieves its investment attraction goal
• Country R bears the cost of preserving incentive

MECHANISM: Credit given for taxes NOT PAID but that
           WOULD have been paid under normal rules
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.3. Arguments For and Against Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has always been contentious, reflecting deeper disagreements about the international tax system:

| Arguments FOR | Arguments AGAINST |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Preserves developing country's sovereign tax policy choices | Creates revenue loss for residence states |
| Promotes investment in developing economies | May subsidize inefficient investment decisions |
| Recognizes development needs (UN Model supports it) | Encourages tax holidays (often poor policy) |
| Prevents residence state from "free-riding" on source country sacrifice | Can be abused through aggressive planning |
| Historical use by Japan, UK with former colonies | Difficult to administer and verify |

### 4.4. The Decline of Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has become **less common** in modern treaty practice for several interconnected reasons:

| Factor | Impact on Tax Sparing |
|--------|----------------------|
| **1998 OECD Report** | Questioned effectiveness; documented limited evidence that tax sparing influenced investment; identified abuse cases |
| **BEPS concerns** | Tax sparing can facilitate base erosion structures; intellectually inconsistent with anti-avoidance focus |
| **Territorial systems** | Many residence countries now exempt foreign income entirely, making tax sparing irrelevant |
| **Harmful tax practices** | Investment incentives subject to FHTP review; tax sparing preserves incentives FHTP may condemn |
| **US policy** | US has **never** granted tax sparing in any treaty |
| **Pillar Two (2024+)** | 15% global minimum tax fundamentally undermines the rationale for tax incentives |

**Pillar Two Impact**: The OECD/G20 Pillar Two rules impose a 15% minimum effective tax rate on large MNEs. If a developing country offers a tax holiday (0% rate), the MNE's home country can impose a "top-up tax" to reach 15%. This:
- Negates the benefit of the holiday (similar to the original problem)
- Makes tax sparing provisions largely pointless
- Forces developing countries to reconsider incentive strategies

**Current Status**: Tax sparing survives in older treaties, some Asian treaties with developing partners, and UK treaties with certain Commonwealth nations. New treaties rarely include it, and existing provisions are often removed during renegotiation.

## 5. Credit Limitations and Baskets

### 5.1. Overall vs Per-Country Limitation

Countries using the credit method must choose how to calculate the limitation when taxpayers have income from multiple foreign sources:

| Approach | How It Works | Effect |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Overall limitation** | Single limit based on total foreign income | Allows "cross-crediting"—excess from high-tax countries offsets capacity from low-tax countries |
| **Per-country limitation** | Separate limit for each source country | Prevents cross-crediting; each country's investment faces at least residence rate |

**Cross-crediting concept**: Under overall limitation, a taxpayer with €10,000 income from a 40% country (€4,000 tax) and €10,000 from a 10% country (€1,000 tax) can use the €1,500 excess credit from the high-tax country against the spare €1,500 capacity from the low-tax country (assuming 25% home rate). Per-country limitation prevents this averaging.

### 5.2. The US Basket System

The US uses a sophisticated basket system to prevent cross-crediting within income categories:

| Basket | Income Types | Policy Rationale |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Passive** | Dividends, interest, royalties, rents | Prevent sheltering passive income with active business credits |
| **General** | Active business income | Core operating income |
| **GILTI** | Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income | Special regime—only 80% credit allowed |
| **Branch** | Branch profits | Separate treatment |

### 5.3. Excess Credit Treatment

When foreign tax exceeds the limitation:

| Treatment | Jurisdictions | Implications |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Carry forward** | UK (unlimited), US (10 years), most OECD | Relief in future years when capacity exists |
| **Carry back** | US (1 year), some others | Amend prior returns |
| **Lost** | Some developing countries | Permanent double taxation on excess |

## 6. Policy Comparison: Credit vs Exemption

Understanding when examiners ask about relief systems requires grasping the fundamental policy trade-offs:

```
CREDIT VS EXEMPTION: POLICY FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CREDIT METHOD (Article 23B)
───────────────────────────
Philosophy: Residence state primacy
Neutrality: Capital EXPORT neutrality (CEN)
Goal: Same effective rate regardless of where invested
Effect: Taxpayer faces home country rate minimum
Favors: High-tax residence countries

EXEMPTION METHOD (Article 23A)
──────────────────────────────
Philosophy: Source state primacy
Neutrality: Capital IMPORT neutrality (CIN)
Goal: Same rate for all investors in a country
Effect: Taxpayer faces source country rate only
Favors: Low-tax source countries, competitiveness

EXAM TIP: December 2022 Q2 asked for "systems available
and policy considerations"—this comparison is essential
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

| Consideration | Credit Method | Exemption Method |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Administrative burden** | HIGH—tracking foreign taxes, limitations, carryovers | LOW—simply exclude foreign income |
| **Revenue impact** | Preserves residence state revenue (collects top-up) | Sacrifices residence state revenue |
| **Investment incentive** | Neutral—no tax advantage to investing abroad | May encourage outbound investment |
| **Competitiveness** | Disadvantages MNEs vs competitors from exemption countries | Levels playing field |
| **Trend** | Declining in popularity | Increasing adoption |

## 7. Worked Exam Example

### 7.1. Policy Analysis Question (December 2022 Style)

**Question**: "The Manualian Revenue Authority is considering whether, and how, to amend its system of relief from juridical double taxation. Outline the various systems available and the main policy considerations involved in adopting each option." (25 marks)

**Answer Framework**:

**(1) Relief by Credit (Article 23B)** [8 marks]

The credit method includes worldwide income in the tax base but allows a deduction from tax liability for foreign taxes paid. This preserves **capital export neutrality**—Manualian investors face the same effective tax rate whether investing domestically or abroad.

**Policy considerations**:
- **Revenue preservation**: Manualia collects the difference between its rate and lower foreign rates
- **Administrative complexity**: Requires tracking foreign taxes, applying limitations, managing carryovers
- **Competitiveness concern**: Manualian MNEs may be disadvantaged versus competitors from exemption countries
- **Direct vs indirect credit**: Must decide whether to extend relief for underlying taxes on dividends from subsidiaries

**(2) Relief by Exemption (Article 23A)** [8 marks]

The exemption method excludes qualifying foreign income from the tax base entirely. This achieves **capital import neutrality**—all investors in a foreign country face the same tax burden regardless of residence.

**Policy considerations**:
- **Simplicity**: No foreign tax verification or limitation calculations needed
- **Competitiveness**: Manualian MNEs compete equally with local companies and other MNEs
- **Revenue cost**: Manualia foregoes tax on foreign profits
- **Participation exemption**: May be limited to substantial shareholdings (e.g., 10%+) in active businesses

**(3) Hybrid Approaches** [5 marks]

Many countries combine methods:
- Credit for active business income, exemption for dividends from subsidiaries
- Subject-to-tax clauses in exemption systems
- Switch-over clauses allowing credit where exemption would create double non-taxation

**(4) Other Methods** [4 marks]

- **Relief by deduction**: Foreign tax deductible as expense (less beneficial than credit)
- **Relief by deferral**: Tax postponed until repatriation (US pre-TCJA approach)

## 8. Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Confusing credit with exemption | Fundamental misunderstanding | Credit = include income, offset tax; Exemption = exclude income |
| Forgetting credit limitation | Incomplete analysis | Always note that credit is capped at residence state's tax on foreign income |
| Ignoring indirect credit conditions | Missing qualifying requirements | State minimum shareholding, direct holding, dividend paid requirements |
| Treating tax sparing as current practice | Outdated analysis | Note its decline and Pillar Two impact |
| Pure calculation focus | Misses policy marks | Emphasize WHY rules exist, not just HOW they calculate |
