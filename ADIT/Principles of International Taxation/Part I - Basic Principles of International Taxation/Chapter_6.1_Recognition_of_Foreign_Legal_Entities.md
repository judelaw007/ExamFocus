## Chapter 6.1: Recognition of Foreign Legal Entities

### 1. The Fundamental Question of Legal Personality

Before a state can tax an entity or before a treaty can apply to it, the entity must first be recognised as a legal person capable of bearing tax obligations. This recognition question sits at the intersection of private international law and tax law, creating a threshold issue that shapes all subsequent tax analysis. Understanding why and how states recognise foreign legal entities is essential for analysing cross-border corporate structures and their treatment under both domestic law and tax treaties.

#### 1.1. Why Recognition Matters for International Taxation

The recognition question asks whether a particular arrangement constitutes a separate legal entity that can be the subject of taxation. The answer determines fundamental aspects of the tax treatment. If a state recognises an arrangement as a separate legal entity, the entity itself becomes the taxpayer, may qualify as treaty-resident, bears separate liability for tax debts, and is subject to corporate taxation on its profits with distributions to members treated as dividends. If a state does not recognise the arrangement as a separate entity, it looks through the arrangement to the underlying members or owners, who become the taxpayers directly; the arrangement cannot claim treaty benefits in its own right, members bear direct liability for any tax obligations, and income flows through to members without a separate distribution event.

This foundational distinction explains why exam scenarios typically establish recognition explicitly—for instance, stating that an entity is "recognised as a separate legal entity for tax and company law purposes" before proceeding to analyse residence and treaty application (covered in December 2022).

#### 1.2. The Source of Recognition Rules

Recognition of legal entities is governed by private international law, also known as conflict of laws, rather than by tax law directly. Each state's private international law rules determine which law governs the existence and legal capacity of an entity—this is known as the lex societatis, the law of the company. When a domestic tax statute refers to a "company" or "corporation," it relies on private international law to determine whether a particular arrangement qualifies as such.

The lex societatis determines whether an entity exists as a legal person, what its legal capacity is, and whether it can own property, enter contracts, sue, and be sued. Tax law then inherits this characterisation. If private international law recognises an entity as a separate legal person, the tax system treats it as capable of being a taxpayer in its own right. If private international law does not recognise the entity, the tax system generally looks through to the underlying members.

### 2. Competing Theories of Recognition

Two principal theories govern how states determine the lex societatis of a foreign entity. These theories can lead to fundamentally different conclusions about whether an entity exists as a matter of law, with significant consequences for taxation.

#### 2.1. The Incorporation Theory

Under the incorporation theory, a company's legal existence and internal affairs are governed by the law of the state where it was incorporated, regardless of where it actually operates or where its management is located. The place of registration determines the applicable law, and founders effectively choose the governing law by selecting an incorporation jurisdiction. The physical location of operations is irrelevant to questions of legal existence.

This approach emphasises party autonomy and legal certainty. Founders can select the corporate law regime that best suits their purposes, and third parties can determine the applicable law simply by identifying where the entity was incorporated. The United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, the Netherlands, and most common law jurisdictions follow the incorporation theory.

The practical effect is significant. A company incorporated in Delaware remains a Delaware corporation for recognition purposes even if all its directors, shareholders, and operations are located in another country. A state following the incorporation theory must recognise it as a valid legal entity under Delaware law.

#### 2.2. The Real Seat Theory

Under the real seat theory, also known as the Sitztheorie in German legal terminology, a company's legal existence is governed by the law of the state where its actual headquarters or effective management is located—the real seat or siège réel. The incorporation jurisdiction is secondary to the location of actual operations and control.

This approach emphasises third-party protection and regulatory control. The state where business genuinely occurs maintains authority over entities operating within its territory, regardless of formal incorporation elsewhere. Germany, Austria, Belgium, Portugal, and many civil law jurisdictions historically applied the real seat theory.

The consequences can be dramatic. Under the real seat theory, a company incorporated abroad but managed domestically may not be recognised as a valid foreign company. Instead, depending on the jurisdiction, it may be treated as a domestic partnership with unlimited liability for members, as a domestic company subject to domestic formation requirements it has not satisfied, or as a non-entity that is void for failure to meet local legal requirements.

### 3. Consequences of the Real Seat Approach

The German approach historically illustrated the real seat theory's impact with particular clarity. In applying this theory, German courts would determine that a company incorporated in another jurisdiction but having its real seat in Germany must be judged against German law. Since such an entity was not incorporated under German law, it could not be treated as a German corporation.

The practical consequence was that shareholders faced unlimited personal liability for company debts—the limited liability shield of the foreign incorporation was not recognised. For tax purposes, this meant the entity was treated as transparent, with income flowing through to members rather than being taxed at entity level. The entity could not be treaty-resident because it was not recognised as a separate legal person capable of residence.

Consider a company incorporated in Switzerland but with its central management in Germany. Under the incorporation theory as applied in Switzerland or the UK, the company is a valid Swiss corporation with limited liability and potential treaty residence in Switzerland. Under the traditional German real seat approach, the same company might be treated as a German partnership, with unlimited member liability, no separate legal personality for German purposes, and income attributed directly to its members for tax purposes.

### 4. EU Law Developments

#### 4.1. ECJ Case Law and Freedom of Establishment

Within the European Union, the real seat theory has been significantly curtailed by European Court of Justice jurisprudence interpreting the freedom of establishment guaranteed by Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. A series of landmark cases established that Member States cannot refuse to recognise companies validly incorporated in other Member States.

In Centros (1999), the Court held that a company validly formed in one Member State must be recognised by other Member States, even if formed specifically to avoid the stricter formation requirements of another state. Überseering (2002) established that refusing to recognise a company's legal capacity violated freedom of establishment—Germany could not deny a Dutch company the capacity to bring legal proceedings simply because its real seat was in Germany. Inspire Art (2003) confirmed that Member States cannot impose domestic formation requirements on foreign EU companies operating within their territory.

The cumulative effect of this jurisprudence has been substantial. Most EU Member States now effectively apply the incorporation theory to companies incorporated within the EU and EEA, even if they formally retain real seat theory in their statutes for other purposes. The freedom of establishment requires mutual recognition of corporate personality throughout the internal market.

#### 4.2. Residual Application of Real Seat Theory

The real seat theory remains relevant within the EU for certain situations. Companies incorporated in non-EU or non-EEA states fall outside the freedom of establishment protections, and Member States may continue to apply real seat theory to such entities. Questions of tax residence, as opposed to legal recognition, continue to be determined by domestic tax law including concepts resembling the real seat. Certain aspects of creditor protection and insolvency law may still look to the location of actual operations.

This creates a bifurcated system in some jurisdictions: the incorporation theory applies to EU companies under the discipline of ECJ case law, while the real seat theory may apply to third-country companies. Tax advisers must consider which regime governs the particular entity in question.

### 5. Recognition and Tax Residence

#### 5.1. Recognition as Prerequisite to Residence

Recognition and residence are related but conceptually distinct. Recognition addresses whether an entity exists as a legal person, while residence addresses where that entity is located for tax purposes. Recognition is determined by private international law through the lex societatis, while residence is determined by tax law, whether domestic statute or treaty provisions. Recognition presents a binary question—the entity either exists or does not—while residence involves a question of location that multiple states may answer differently, creating dual residence situations.

A state must first recognise an entity as existing before it can determine whether that entity is resident. This sequencing explains why exam questions establish recognition explicitly before proceeding to residence analysis. Only after confirming that an entity is "recognised as a separate legal entity" can the analysis address domestic residence tests and, if dual residence arises, treaty tie-breaker provisions under Article 4 of the OECD Model.

#### 5.2. The Conceptual Distinction

Although the real seat concept in recognition analysis resembles the place of effective management concept in tax residence determination, they serve different functions. A state following the incorporation theory for recognition purposes may still use place of effective management as its domestic tax residence test. Recognition determines whether an entity exists at all; residence determines where an entity that exists should be taxed. An entity that is not recognised cannot be resident, but an entity that is recognised may be resident nowhere, in one state, or in multiple states depending on the application of residence tests.

The distinction matters practically. An entity might be recognised as existing under the incorporation theory—accepted as a valid foreign corporation—but still found to be resident in the recognising state because its place of effective management is located there. Recognition and residence operate on different planes and should not be conflated.

### 6. Recognition Mismatches and Their Tax Consequences

#### 6.1. When States Disagree on Recognition

Different states may reach different conclusions about whether the same entity exists as a legal person. This creates recognition mismatches with significant tax consequences. Consider a Delaware LLC with its management in a jurisdiction applying the real seat theory. Under US principles, the LLC exists as a valid legal entity whose classification for tax purposes depends on the check-the-box regulations. Under the real seat jurisdiction's approach, the LLC might not be recognised as a valid foreign entity at all because it is managed locally but not formed under local law.

When a state does not recognise a foreign entity, several consequences follow. There is no entity-level taxation—the arrangement is looked through and members are taxed directly on their shares of income. There is no treaty access—an unrecognised entity cannot be a person covered under Article 1 or a resident under Article 4 of a tax treaty. Withholding tax treatment becomes complicated as payments to the entity may be characterised as payments to members, potentially from different jurisdictions with different treaty entitlements. Anti-avoidance provisions such as controlled foreign company rules may operate differently when income is attributed to members at an earlier stage.

#### 6.2. Connection to Hybrid Entity Issues

Recognition mismatches form one foundation for hybrid entity outcomes. When one state recognises an arrangement as a separate company while another treats it as transparent, the same income may be attributed to different persons in different jurisdictions. This creates both planning opportunities—the possibility of achieving double non-taxation through careful structuring—and compliance risks—the possibility of unexpected double taxation when relief mechanisms fail to align.

The OECD's work on base erosion and profit shifting addressed these issues through Action 2, which developed recommendations for neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Many jurisdictions have implemented linking rules that deny deductions or require income inclusion when mismatches arise from differences in entity characterisation between jurisdictions. These rules respond directly to the fundamental recognition and characterisation differences discussed in this chapter, attempting to coordinate outcomes when states disagree about the nature of cross-border arrangements (covered in December 2024).

Understanding recognition as a distinct concept from characterisation and residence provides the foundation for analysing these more complex hybrid situations in subsequent chapters.
