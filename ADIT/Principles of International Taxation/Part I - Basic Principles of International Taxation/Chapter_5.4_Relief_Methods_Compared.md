## Chapter 5.4: Relief by Exemption and Relief by Credit Compared – Capital Import Neutrality vs Capital Export Neutrality

### 1. The Economic Neutrality Framework

Tax systems inevitably influence economic behaviour. In purely domestic contexts, policymakers generally aspire to neutrality—designing taxes that minimise distortions and avoid causing different decisions than would occur absent taxation. International taxation presents a more complex challenge because cross-border transactions involve at least two tax systems with potentially conflicting design objectives. Two competing neutrality concepts address different aspects of this problem, each with distinct implications for which relief method a country should adopt.

#### 1.1. Why Neutrality Matters

Capital export neutrality and capital import neutrality emerged from mid-twentieth century welfare economics as frameworks for evaluating the efficiency of international tax rules. Neither represents an absolute principle, but together they illuminate the fundamental policy trade-offs inherent in designing relief mechanisms. The choice between these concepts reflects deeper questions about whose tax policy preferences should govern cross-border income and how the international tax system should allocate taxing rights between residence and source jurisdictions.

#### 1.2. The Fundamental Trade-Off

The credit method, embodied in Article 23B of the OECD Model Tax Convention, reflects residence-state primacy—the view that a country's residents should pay that country's tax rate regardless of where their income is earned. The exemption method, reflected in Article 23A, embodies source-state primacy—the view that the country where income arises should determine the effective tax rate. Neither position is inherently superior; they represent different values about fairness, efficiency, and the proper relationship between competing tax claims on the same income.

### 2. Capital Export Neutrality

#### 2.1. Definition and Concept

Capital export neutrality exists when an investor's tax burden is the same regardless of where they invest. An investor from Country R pays the same total tax whether investing domestically or in Country S, removing tax as a factor in investment location decisions. The goal is to ensure that investment flows to its most productive use based on pre-tax returns rather than to the lowest-tax jurisdiction.

From the investor's perspective, capital export neutrality means that a domestic investment yielding 12% pre-tax and a foreign investment yielding 10% pre-tax will be evaluated on their economic merits. Without tax distortions, the higher-returning domestic project will be chosen. Tax considerations should not cause the investor to prefer a less productive foreign investment simply because it is taxed more lightly.

#### 2.2. How the Credit Method Achieves CEN

The credit method achieves capital export neutrality by ensuring the investor always faces at least their home country rate. When an investor from a 35% rate country earns income in a 15% rate country, the credit mechanism operates as follows: the source country taxes at 15%, the residence country includes the foreign income in its worldwide tax base and calculates tax at 35%, and the taxpayer receives a credit for the 15% foreign tax paid. The result is that the residence country collects the remaining 20%, bringing the total effective rate to 35%—the same rate the investor would face on domestic income.

When the foreign rate exceeds the domestic rate, the credit is limited to the residence country's own tax on the foreign income, leaving the taxpayer bearing the higher foreign rate. In either case, the investor never pays less than the domestic rate on foreign income, eliminating tax-driven incentives to invest abroad purely for rate arbitrage.

#### 2.3. Policy Arguments for CEN

Proponents of capital export neutrality advance several policy justifications. The efficient capital allocation argument holds that investment should flow to its most productive use globally, and tax-induced distortions cause misallocation of capital to lower-returning projects in low-tax jurisdictions. The revenue protection argument emphasises that the residence state captures tax up to its rate on all resident income, preventing revenue leakage to low-tax jurisdictions that might otherwise attract investment diverted from the domestic economy.

Horizontal equity considerations support treating similarly situated taxpayers equally—all residents face the same effective rate regardless of where their income is earned. Additionally, capital export neutrality aligns with anti-avoidance objectives by reducing incentives for profit shifting and artificial structures designed to locate income in low-tax jurisdictions, since no tax benefit results from such arrangements when the residence country tops up to its own rate.

### 3. Capital Import Neutrality

#### 3.1. Definition and Concept

Capital import neutrality exists when all investors in a particular market face the same tax burden regardless of their residence. All competitors in Country S—whether local enterprises or foreign-owned subsidiaries—face Country S's tax rate and compete on equal terms. The goal is to ensure a level playing field within each market, with competition determined by operational efficiency rather than home country tax rates.

From the market's perspective, capital import neutrality means that a local Company S, a subsidiary of Country R, and a subsidiary of Country T all face identical taxation when operating in Country S. No investor gains competitive advantage from their home country's tax system, and all must compete based on their actual commercial capabilities.

#### 3.2. How the Exemption Method Achieves CIN

The exemption method achieves capital import neutrality by ensuring only source-state tax applies to foreign income. When an investor from Country R earns income in Country S, and Country R exempts foreign income from its tax base, the investor bears only Country S's tax. Investors from other exemption countries face the same position. All competitors in Country S thus bear identical tax burdens determined solely by Country S's rate.

The exemption may be complete or may operate with a progression reservation, where exempt income is taken into account in determining the rate applicable to other income. Either way, the residence state imposes no additional tax on the foreign income, leaving source-state tax as the only burden and equalising the position of all investors in that source jurisdiction.

#### 3.3. Policy Arguments for CIN

Proponents of capital import neutrality emphasise competitive equality—foreign subsidiaries compete on equal terms with domestic companies, with no artificial advantage flowing from lower home-country tax rates. This reflects the commercial reality that multinational enterprises care most about competing effectively in each market, and a level playing field is the most important consideration from an operational perspective.

Source state sovereignty arguments support the view that if Country S sets a 20% rate to attract investment or fund public services, Country R should not override this policy choice by imposing additional taxation on its residents' income from Country S. Administrative simplicity also favours exemption, as it eliminates complex credit calculations, foreign tax verification requirements, and limitation computations that create compliance burdens for both taxpayers and tax authorities.

### 4. The Mathematical Impossibility

#### 4.1. Why Both Cannot Be Achieved Simultaneously

If two countries have different tax rates, capital export neutrality and capital import neutrality cannot both be achieved. This is a mathematical impossibility, not merely a policy difficulty. Consider Country R with a 35% rate and Country S with a 20% rate. Capital export neutrality requires that an investor from R face 35% on all investments, including those in S. Capital import neutrality requires that all investors in S—including those from R—face 20%. Since 35% cannot simultaneously equal 20%, satisfying one neutrality necessarily violates the other.

This mathematical constraint forces countries to choose which neutrality to prioritise. The choice reflects national interests, economic position, and policy preferences rather than any objectively correct answer. The impossibility theorem explains why different countries adopt different approaches and why no uniform international consensus exists on the optimal relief method.

#### 4.2. The Trade-Off in Practice

A country using the credit method achieves capital export neutrality but violates capital import neutrality—its investors in foreign markets face higher effective rates than local competitors whose home countries use exemption. A country using the exemption method achieves capital import neutrality but violates capital export neutrality—its investors may face lower effective rates on foreign income than on domestic income, creating tax incentives to invest abroad.

This trade-off explains observed patterns in national practice. Countries select their relief method based on which neutrality better serves their interests, and these interests differ systematically based on economic circumstances.

### 5. National Interest and Method Choice

#### 5.1. Country Type Analysis

Countries' relief method preferences align with their economic positions. Net capital exporters—countries whose residents invest more abroad than foreigners invest domestically—traditionally preferred the credit method. Protecting the domestic tax base, preventing revenue loss on outbound investment, and discouraging capital flight to low-tax jurisdictions all favour maintaining residence taxation through the credit mechanism.

Net capital importers—typically developing countries seeking foreign direct investment—often prefer exemption systems. Ensuring a level playing field for local competitors, respecting source taxation as a development tool, and simplifying compliance for inbound investors all support exemption. Financial and holding company centres also favour exemption for competitive reasons—participation exemptions attract holding company structures, and favourable treatment enhances treaty network attractiveness.

Large economies with significant both inbound and outbound investment may employ hybrid approaches, applying different methods to different income types or allowing taxpayer elections in certain circumstances.

#### 5.2. The Global Shift Toward Territorial Systems

Since the 1990s, there has been a dramatic shift toward exemption and territorial systems among developed countries. Where more than twenty OECD countries employed worldwide taxation with credit in the 1990s, only four—Chile, Israel, Korea, and Mexico—retained fully worldwide systems by 2025. The United States moved to a largely territorial system with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017, joining the majority of OECD countries that now provide participation exemption for qualifying foreign dividends.

This shift reflects several factors: multinational enterprise lobbying for competitive equality with foreign competitors, recognition that credit systems create competitive disadvantages for domestic multinationals, the simplification benefits of territorial approaches, and global tax competition pressures. The trend represents a revealed preference for capital import neutrality over capital export neutrality among major economies, though this preference is not universal and remains contested in academic and policy debates.

### 6. Modern Developments

#### 6.1. Capital Ownership Neutrality

Academic literature has introduced capital ownership neutrality as a third concept: a tax system that does not distort who owns assets. The question is whether taxation affects whether a Company R or Company S would own a particular target company. Like capital import neutrality, capital ownership neutrality generally supports exemption systems because worldwide taxation with credit creates different after-tax returns for potential acquirers based on home country rates, distorting merger and acquisition decisions.

Under credit systems, a potential acquirer from a high-rate country would receive lower after-tax returns from a target than a potential acquirer from a low-rate country, even if the high-rate acquirer could operate the target more efficiently. Under exemption, all potential acquirers face the same source-country rate on the target's income, and ownership is determined by operational efficiency rather than tax considerations.

#### 6.2. Pillar Two and the Neutrality Paradigm

The OECD Pillar Two global minimum tax fundamentally alters the capital neutrality debate. By imposing a 15% minimum effective tax rate on large multinational enterprises through the Income Inclusion Rule and other mechanisms, Pillar Two introduces elements resembling capital export neutrality into systems that previously operated on pure exemption principles.

Before Pillar Two, an investor from an exemption country earning income in a 5% tax jurisdiction faced only 5% effective tax, potentially creating substantial competitive advantages over investors from credit countries. After Pillar Two, the same investor faces a 10% top-up tax through the Income Inclusion Rule, bringing the effective rate to the 15% minimum. This reduces—though does not eliminate—the differential between exemption and credit country investors.

Pillar Two represents a partial convergence toward capital export neutrality principles without adopting the credit method directly. Exemption countries retain advantages above the 15% floor—their investors still face lower effective rates than credit country investors in jurisdictions with rates between 15% and residence country rates. The global minimum thus constrains the "race to bottom" that capital import neutrality critics identify, while preserving meaningful differences between the two approaches for above-minimum rate jurisdictions (covered in June 2025).

The interaction between traditional neutrality concepts and the emerging global minimum tax framework continues to evolve. Countries must now consider not only which domestic relief method to adopt but also how that choice interacts with Pillar Two obligations and the relief methods of treaty partners—adding new layers of complexity to what was already a challenging policy choice.
