## A. DIRECT CREDIT (BASIC FOREIGN TAX CREDIT)

### 1. When Direct Credit Applies

The **direct credit** is the simplest form of foreign tax credit. It applies when:
- A resident taxpayer earns foreign-source income
- The taxpayer **directly pays** tax on that income to the source state
- The residence state allows a credit for the foreign tax paid

```
DIRECT CREDIT SCENARIO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    TAXPAYER (Resident of Country R)
              │
              │ Earns income
              ▼
    ┌─────────────────────┐
    │   FOREIGN INCOME    │
    │   (Country S)       │
    │   e.g., Employment  │
    │   Rental income     │
    │   Business profits  │
    └─────────────────────┘
              │
              │ Tax paid directly

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Common Applications of Direct Credit

| Income Type | Source State Tax | Credit Available |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Employment income** | Tax withheld or assessed in country of work | Credit for tax on employment income |
| **Rental income** | Tax on property income in situs state | Credit for property tax (if income tax) |
| **Business profits** | Tax on branch profits | Credit for branch profits tax |
| **Dividends** | Withholding tax on gross dividend | Credit for WHT (direct tax on shareholder) |
| **Interest/Royalties** | Withholding tax | Credit for WHT |

### 3. Direct Credit Calculation Example

**Scenario**: A UK resident individual earns £50,000 employment income in Australia. Australian tax of £12,500 (25%) was paid. UK higher rate is 40%.

```
DIRECT CREDIT CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: UK tax on foreign income
        £50,000 × 40% = £20,000

Step 2: Foreign tax paid (directly by taxpayer)
        Australian tax = £12,500

Step 3: Credit limitation
        Maximum credit = UK tax on foreign income = £20,000
        Actual foreign tax = £12,500
        Credit allowed = £12,500 (lower amount)

Step 4: UK tax liability
        UK tax before credit: £20,000
        Less: Foreign tax credit: (£12,500)
        UK tax payable: £7,500

Step 5: Total tax burden
        Australia: £12,500
        UK: £7,500
        Total: £20,000 (effective rate 40%)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## B. INDIRECT CREDIT (UNDERLYING TAX CREDIT)

### 1. The Problem Indirect Credit Solves

When a parent company receives **dividends from a foreign subsidiary**, two layers of tax have typically been paid:

| Layer | Tax Paid By | Nature |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Layer 1** | Subsidiary | Corporate tax on subsidiary's profits |
| **Layer 2** | Parent | WHT on dividend (if any) + residence state tax on dividend |

The **direct credit** only relieves the WHT (Layer 2). It does not address the **underlying corporate tax** (Layer 1) paid by the subsidiary. This can result in significant economic double taxation.

```
THE UNDERLYING TAX PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    SUBSIDIARY (Country S)
    ────────────────────────
    Pre-tax profits:        €1,000,000
    Corporate tax (25%):    (€250,000)  ← Layer 1: Underlying tax
    ────────────────────────
    After-tax profits:      €750,000

    Dividend declared:      €750,000
    WHT (15%):             (€112,500)   ← Layer 2: WHT (direct tax)
    ────────────────────────
    Net dividend received:  €637,500

    PARENT (Country R)
    ────────────────────────
    Dividend income:        €750,000 (gross)
    Residence state tax (30%): €225,000

    WITHOUT INDIRECT CREDIT:
    Direct credit for WHT only: (€112,500)
    Tax payable in R:          €112,500

    Total tax: €250,000 + €112,500 + €112,500 = €475,000
    Effective rate: 47.5%  ← EXCESSIVE DOUBLE TAXATION

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. How Indirect Credit Works

The **indirect credit** (or **underlying tax credit**) allows the parent company to claim a credit not just for the WHT, but also for a portion of the **subsidiary's corporate tax** attributable to the dividend.

```
INDIRECT CREDIT CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Formula for underlying tax credit:

                              Dividend Received
Underlying Tax Credit = ─────────────────────────── × Corporate Tax
                        Profits After Corporate Tax

Using example above:
                         €750,000
Underlying Tax Credit = ──────────── × €250,000 = €250,000
                         €750,000

TOTAL CREDIT AVAILABLE:
Direct credit (WHT):        €112,500
Indirect credit (Corp tax): €250,000
                           ─────────
Total credit:              €362,500

But credit limited to R's tax on dividend:
R's tax: €225,000 (on €750,000 at 30%)
Credit allowed: €225,000 (limited)
Excess credit: €137,500 (lost or carried forward)

Tax payable in R: €0 (after credit)
Total tax: €250,000 + €112,500 = €362,500
Effective rate: 36.25%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Conditions for Indirect Credit

Indirect credit is typically available only when:

| Condition | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Minimum shareholding** | Usually 10-25% of voting shares to qualify |
| **Direct holding** | Parent must directly own subsidiary shares |
| **Dividend actually paid** | Not available for retained profits |
| **Tax actually paid** | By subsidiary (not tax spared) |
| **Treaty provision** | Must be specifically provided in treaty |

**Note**: The OECD Model does not specifically mandate indirect credit. Article 23B provides for credit of tax "paid in the other State," which some interpret as including underlying tax. However, many treaties explicitly include indirect credit provisions.

### 4. Multi-Tier Indirect Credit

Some countries extend indirect credit through **multiple tiers** of subsidiaries:

```
MULTI-TIER STRUCTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    PARENT (Country R)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 1 (Country A)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 2 (Country B)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 3 (Country C) ← Operating company earning profits

US (pre-2017): Indirect credit available through 6 tiers
UK: Generally available for direct subsidiaries only
Many countries: Limited to 2-3 tiers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## C. TAX SPARING CREDITS

### 1. The Concept and Rationale

**Tax sparing** is a special credit mechanism designed to preserve the benefits of tax incentives offered by developing countries.

**The Problem Tax Sparing Addresses**:

When a developing country offers a tax holiday or reduced rate to attract foreign investment, the benefit may be "clawed back" by the residence state through the credit method:

```
TAX INCENTIVE "CLAW-BACK" PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Developing Country S offers 10-year tax holiday to attract investment
Normal S rate: 30%
Country R (investor residence) rate: 35%

WITHOUT TAX SPARING:
─────────────────────
Income in S:            $1,000,000
S tax (holiday):        $0
R tax on worldwide:     $350,000
Credit for S tax:       $0 (none paid)
─────────────────────────────────
Final tax in R:         $350,000

RESULT: Tax holiday benefit captured by Country R, not investor
        S loses revenue but investor gets no benefit
        Investment incentive is negated

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. How Tax Sparing Works

With a **tax sparing credit**, the residence state grants a credit for the tax that **would have been paid** in the source state but for the incentive:

```
TAX SPARING SOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITH TAX SPARING:
─────────────────────
Income in S:                $1,000,000
S tax (holiday):            $0
S tax that WOULD have been paid: $300,000 (30% normal rate)

R tax on worldwide:         $350,000
Tax sparing credit:         $300,000 (deemed tax)
─────────────────────────────────────
Final tax in R:             $50,000

RESULT: Investor benefits from incentive ($250,000 saving)
        S achieves investment attraction goal
        R bears cost of preserving incentive

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Tax Sparing in Treaties

Tax sparing provisions are included through **specific treaty articles** or protocols:

**Example Treaty Language**:
> "Where a resident of [State A] derives income from [State B] and such income is exempt from tax or taxed at a reduced rate in [State B] under the laws of [State B] designed to promote economic development, [State A] shall allow a credit against its tax as if [State B] had levied tax at the rate of [X]%."

### 4. Arguments For and Against Tax Sparing

| Arguments FOR Tax Sparing | Arguments AGAINST Tax Sparing |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Preserves developing country incentives | Creates revenue loss for residence states |
| Promotes international investment | May subsidize inefficient investment |
| Supports development goals | Encourages "tax holidays" which may be harmful |
| Recognized by UN Model | Can be abused through aggressive planning |
| Historical use by major economies | Difficult to administer and verify |

### 5. The Decline of Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has become **less common** in modern treaty practice for several reasons:

| Factor | Impact on Tax Sparing |
|--------|----------------------|
| **OECD skepticism** | 1998 OECD Report questioned effectiveness |
| **BEPS concerns** | Tax sparing can facilitate BEPS structures |
| **Territorial systems** | Many countries now exempt foreign income, making sparing unnecessary |
| **Harmful tax practices** | Incentives subject to FHTP review |
| **US policy** | US has never granted tax sparing in treaties |

**Current Status**: Tax sparing is still found in:
- Older treaties that haven't been renegotiated
- Treaties between developed and developing countries (especially UN Model-based)
- Some Asian treaties (Japan, Korea with developing partners)
- UK treaties with certain Commonwealth nations

## D. CREDIT LIMITATIONS AND BASKETS

### 1. Overall Limitation vs Per-Country Limitation

Countries using the credit method must decide how to calculate the credit limitation:

```
LIMITATION APPROACHES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Taxpayer earns income in two foreign countries
          Home rate: 30%

          Country A: €100,000 income, 40% tax = €40,000 tax
          Country B: €100,000 income, 10% tax = €10,000 tax

OVERALL LIMITATION:
───────────────────
Total foreign income: €200,000
Home tax on foreign income: €200,000 × 30% = €60,000
Total foreign tax: €50,000
Credit allowed: €50,000 (within limit)
Net effect: High and low tax countries averaged

PER-COUNTRY LIMITATION:
───────────────────────
Country A: Credit limit = €30,000, tax paid €40,000
           Credit = €30,000, excess €10,000 lost
Country B: Credit limit = €30,000, tax paid €10,000
           Credit = €10,000
Total credit: €40,000
Net effect: Excess credits cannot offset low-tax income

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Basket Systems (US Approach)

The US uses a **basket system** that segregates foreign income into categories:

| Basket | Income Types | Limitation |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Passive** | Dividends, interest, royalties, rents | Separate limit |
| **General** | Active business income | Separate limit |
| **GILTI** | Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income | 80% credit only |
| **Branch** | Branch profits | Separate limit |

**Purpose**: Prevents "cross-crediting" where high-tax active income credits offset low-tax passive income.

### 3. Excess Credit Carryover

When foreign tax exceeds the credit limitation, most countries allow:

| Treatment | Countries Using |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Carry forward** | UK (unlimited), US (10 years), most OECD |
| **Carry back** | US (1 year), some others |
| **Lost** | Some developing countries |

## E. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLES

### Worked Example 1: Direct vs Indirect Credit Comparison

**Scenario** (15 marks):

ParentCo, resident in Country P (corporate rate 25%), owns 100% of SubCo in Country S (corporate rate 20%). SubCo earns profits of €2,000,000 and pays dividends of €1,200,000 to ParentCo. Country S levies 10% WHT on dividends. The P-S treaty follows the OECD Model.

**Required**:
(a) Calculate ParentCo's tax position with direct credit only (5 marks)
(b) Calculate ParentCo's tax position with indirect (underlying) credit (5 marks)
(c) Explain the policy rationale for indirect credit (5 marks)

**Model Answer**:

**(a) Direct Credit Only (5 marks)**

```
Step 1: SubCo's position
Pre-tax profits:                     €2,000,000
Country S corporate tax (20%):       (€400,000)
After-tax profits:                   €1,600,000
Dividend declared:                   €1,200,000

Step 2: WHT on dividend
Gross dividend:                      €1,200,000
WHT (10%):                          (€120,000)
Net dividend received:               €1,080,000

Step 3: ParentCo's tax liability
Taxable dividend income:             €1,200,000
Country P tax (25%):                 €300,000
Direct credit (WHT only):           (€120,000)
Tax payable in P:                    €180,000

Step 4: Total tax burden
SubCo corporate tax:                 €400,000 × (1,200/1,600) = €300,000 (attributable)
WHT:                                 €120,000
ParentCo tax:                        €180,000
Total:                               €600,000

Effective rate: €600,000 / €1,500,000 gross-up = 40% ← Excessive
```

**(b) With Indirect Credit (5 marks)**

```
Step 1: Calculate underlying tax
Underlying tax = (Dividend / After-tax profits) × Corporate tax
               = (€1,200,000 / €1,600,000) × €400,000
               = €300,000

Step 2: Total credit available
Direct credit (WHT):                 €120,000
Indirect credit (underlying):        €300,000
Total potential credit:              €420,000

Step 3: Credit limitation
Grossed-up dividend: €1,200,000 + €300,000 = €1,500,000
Country P tax on gross-up: €1,500,000 × 25% = €375,000
Maximum credit: €375,000
Credit allowed: €375,000 (limited)
Excess credit: €45,000 (carried forward)

Step 4: Tax payable
Country P tax:                       €375,000
Less credit:                        (€375,000)
Tax payable in P:                    €0

Step 5: Total tax burden
SubCo corporate tax (attributable):  €300,000
WHT:                                 €120,000
ParentCo tax:                        €0
Total:                               €420,000

Effective rate: €420,000 / €1,500,000 = 28%
```

**(c) Policy Rationale for Indirect Credit (5 marks)**

The indirect credit exists to address **economic double taxation** that arises when corporate profits are taxed at both the subsidiary level and again when distributed as dividends to the parent.

**Key policy justifications**:

1. **Economic integration**: The parent and subsidiary form an economic unit; taxing the same profits at both levels creates an excessive burden that would discourage cross-border investment.

2. **Competitive neutrality**: Without indirect credit, a domestic subsidiary would be taxed once (corporation tax), while a foreign subsidiary's profits would face multiple layers of tax, distorting investment decisions.

3. **Capital export neutrality**: The credit method aims to ensure investors face the same tax burden regardless of where they invest. Without indirect credit, this neutrality is compromised for subsidiary structures.

4. **Prevention of discriminatory effects**: Requiring investors to use branch structures (which get full credit) to avoid double taxation would distort business organization choices.

**Limitations**: Indirect credit is administratively complex, requiring verification of foreign subsidiary accounts and tax payments. It also raises issues about how many tiers of subsidiaries should qualify.

### Worked Example 2: Tax Sparing Analysis

**Scenario** (10 marks):

Country D is a developing country that offers a 5-year tax holiday for manufacturing investments. InvestorCo, resident in Country R (rate 35%), invests in Country D. Without the holiday, Country D's rate would be 25%. InvestorCo earns $5,000,000 in Year 1.

**Required**:
(a) Calculate InvestorCo's position with and without tax sparing (5 marks)
(b) Discuss the arguments for and against tax sparing provisions (5 marks)

**Model Answer**:

**(a) Calculation (5 marks)**

```
WITHOUT TAX SPARING:
────────────────────
Income in D:                         $5,000,000
D tax (holiday):                     $0
R tax (35%):                         $1,750,000
Credit for D tax:                    $0
Net R tax:                           $1,750,000
Total tax: $1,750,000 (effective rate 35%)
Investor benefit from holiday: $0

WITH TAX SPARING:
─────────────────
Income in D:                         $5,000,000
D tax (holiday):                     $0
"Deemed" D tax (25%):                $1,250,000
R tax (35%):                         $1,750,000
Tax sparing credit:                  $1,250,000
Net R tax:                           $500,000
Total tax: $500,000 (effective rate 10%)
Investor benefit from holiday: $1,250,000
```

**(b) Arguments For and Against Tax Sparing (5 marks)**

**Arguments FOR**:

1. **Preserves incentive effectiveness**: Without tax sparing, the developing country loses revenue but the investor gains nothing—the benefit transfers to Country R. Tax sparing ensures incentives achieve their investment attraction purpose.

2. **Supports development goals**: Developing countries use tax incentives as a key policy tool to attract foreign capital and technology. Tax sparing respects their sovereignty to offer such incentives.

3. **Historical precedent**: The UN Model recognizes tax sparing, and many developed countries have historically included such provisions (UK, Japan, France).

**Arguments AGAINST**:

1. **Revenue cost to residence state**: Country R effectively subsidizes Country D's development policy, which may not align with R's own priorities.

2. **Encourages harmful competition**: Tax sparing may encourage "races to the bottom" where countries compete through ever-more generous incentives, eroding the global tax base.

3. **Administrative complexity**: Verifying which income qualifies for sparing and calculating deemed taxes adds compliance burden.

4. **BEPS concerns**: Tax sparing can be exploited in aggressive structures, generating income that is neither actually taxed anywhere nor subject to deemed credit.

5. **Questionable effectiveness**: OECD research suggests tax sparing may not significantly influence investment decisions, which depend more on market access, infrastructure, and legal stability.

**Current trend**: Tax sparing is declining. The US has never granted it, and many developed countries now prefer exemption systems that achieve similar outcomes without the specific issues tax sparing raises.

## F. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
ESSENTIAL POINTS TO REMEMBER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. THREE TYPES OF CREDIT:
   • Direct: Credit for tax paid directly by taxpayer
   • Indirect: Credit for underlying corporate tax on dividends
   • Tax sparing: Credit for tax that would have been paid

2. DIRECT CREDIT applies to:
   • Employment income tax
   • Branch profits tax
   • WHT on dividends, interest, royalties

3. INDIRECT CREDIT:
   • Addresses economic double taxation on dividends
   • Formula: (Dividend/After-tax profits) × Corporate tax
   • Usually requires minimum shareholding (10-25%)

4. TAX SPARING:
   • Preserves developing country incentives
   • Credit for "deemed" tax not actually paid
   • Declining in modern treaty practice
   • BEPS concerns have accelerated decline

5. CREDIT LIMITATIONS:
   • Overall vs per-country calculation
   • Basket systems (US) segregate income types
   • Excess credits typically carry forward

6. EXAM CALCULATION STEPS:
   • Identify type of credit applicable
   • Calculate potential credit (actual or deemed)
   • Apply limitation (residence state tax on foreign income)
   • Determine excess credit treatment
