## A. DIRECT CREDIT (BASIC FOREIGN TAX CREDIT)

### 1. When Direct Credit Applies

The **direct credit** is the simplest form of foreign tax credit and represents the foundational principle from which more complex credit mechanisms evolved. It applies when:
- A resident taxpayer earns foreign-source income
- The taxpayer **directly pays** tax on that income to the source state
- The residence state allows a credit for the foreign tax paid

The elegance of the direct credit lies in its straightforward logic: you paid tax abroad, so you get credit at home. This mechanism traces back to the earliest attempts to address double taxation in the 1920s, when policymakers recognized that allowing a deduction for foreign taxes (treating them as an expense) provided inadequate relief. A deduction only reduces taxable income, whereas a credit reduces the tax itself—a far more complete form of relief.

### 2. Common Applications of Direct Credit

Direct credit applies across a wide range of income types, but the key requirement is always the same: the taxpayer must have directly borne the foreign tax liability. This distinguishes it from indirect credit, where the tax was paid by a separate legal entity (the subsidiary).

| Income Type | Source State Tax | Credit Available |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Employment income** | Tax withheld or assessed in country of work | Credit for tax on employment income |
| **Rental income** | Tax on property income in situs state | Credit for property tax (if income tax) |
| **Business profits** | Tax on branch profits | Credit for branch profits tax |
| **Dividends** | Withholding tax on gross dividend | Credit for WHT (direct tax on shareholder) |
| **Interest/Royalties** | Withholding tax | Credit for WHT |

The distinction between withholding taxes and assessed taxes matters in practice. Withholding taxes are deducted at source—the payer withholds a portion and remits it to the tax authority on the recipient's behalf. The recipient never actually receives that portion but is treated as having paid the tax. Assessed taxes, by contrast, require the taxpayer to file a return and pay directly. Both qualify for direct credit, but withholding taxes are administratively simpler because they are documented through standardized certificates.

### 3. Direct Credit Calculation Example

**Scenario**: A UK resident individual earns £50,000 employment income in Australia. Australian tax of £12,500 (25%) was paid. UK higher rate is 40%.

```
DIRECT CREDIT CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: UK tax on foreign income
        £50,000 × 40% = £20,000

Step 2: Foreign tax paid (directly by taxpayer)
        Australian tax = £12,500

Step 3: Credit limitation
        Maximum credit = UK tax on foreign income = £20,000
        Actual foreign tax = £12,500
        Credit allowed = £12,500 (lower amount)

Step 4: UK tax liability
        UK tax before credit: £20,000
        Less: Foreign tax credit: (£12,500)
        UK tax payable: £7,500

Step 5: Total tax burden
        Australia: £12,500
        UK: £7,500
        Total: £20,000 (effective rate 40%)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This example illustrates a fundamental truth about the credit method: when the source-state rate is lower than the residence-state rate, the taxpayer ends up paying the residence-state rate through the "top-up" mechanism. The credit eliminates double taxation but ensures the residence state collects the difference. This is why credit-method countries view it as preserving their tax base while still providing relief.

## B. INDIRECT CREDIT (UNDERLYING TAX CREDIT)

### 1. The Problem Indirect Credit Solves

The development of indirect credit represents one of the more sophisticated solutions in international tax policy. It emerged from a recognition that multinational enterprises often operate through subsidiary structures rather than branches, and that this organizational choice should not result in punitive taxation.

When a parent company receives **dividends from a foreign subsidiary**, two layers of tax have typically been paid:

| Layer | Tax Paid By | Nature |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Layer 1** | Subsidiary | Corporate tax on subsidiary's profits |
| **Layer 2** | Parent | WHT on dividend (if any) + residence state tax on dividend |

The **direct credit** only relieves the WHT (Layer 2). It does not address the **underlying corporate tax** (Layer 1) paid by the subsidiary. This creates a troubling asymmetry: if the same business operated as a branch rather than a subsidiary, the parent would pay tax directly on branch profits and receive full credit. Why should the legal form of the foreign operation determine the tax burden?

This question drove the development of indirect credit. Policymakers recognized that treating subsidiaries less favorably than branches would distort organizational choices—companies would structure inefficiently just to minimize taxes. The economic substance of earning profits abroad is the same whether done through a branch or subsidiary; the tax system should not favor one form over the other.

```
THE UNDERLYING TAX PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    SUBSIDIARY (Country S)
    ────────────────────────
    Pre-tax profits:        €1,000,000
    Corporate tax (25%):    (€250,000)  ← Layer 1: Underlying tax
    ────────────────────────
    After-tax profits:      €750,000

    Dividend declared:      €750,000
    WHT (15%):             (€112,500)   ← Layer 2: WHT (direct tax)
    ────────────────────────
    Net dividend received:  €637,500

    PARENT (Country R)
    ────────────────────────
    Dividend income:        €750,000 (gross)
    Residence state tax (30%): €225,000

    WITHOUT INDIRECT CREDIT:
    Direct credit for WHT only: (€112,500)
    Tax payable in R:          €112,500

    Total tax: €250,000 + €112,500 + €112,500 = €475,000
    Effective rate: 47.5%  ← EXCESSIVE DOUBLE TAXATION

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. How Indirect Credit Works

The **indirect credit** (or **underlying tax credit**) allows the parent company to claim a credit not just for the WHT, but also for a portion of the **subsidiary's corporate tax** attributable to the dividend.

The intellectual leap required to justify indirect credit is significant: Country R is granting credit for a tax that was not paid by the taxpayer (Parent) but by a separate legal entity (Subsidiary). This requires treating the parent and subsidiary as an economic unit for credit purposes, even though they remain separate legal persons for other purposes. Some scholars have criticized this as conceptually incoherent—if the entities are separate enough that corporate profits are taxed at the subsidiary level, why should they be treated as unified for credit purposes?

The practical answer is that without indirect credit, the system produces results that most observers consider unfair and economically distortive. Whether the conceptual framework is perfectly coherent matters less than whether the outcomes are reasonable.

```
INDIRECT CREDIT CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Formula for underlying tax credit:

                              Dividend Received
Underlying Tax Credit = ─────────────────────────── × Corporate Tax
                        Profits After Corporate Tax

Using example above:
                         €750,000
Underlying Tax Credit = ──────────── × €250,000 = €250,000
                         €750,000

TOTAL CREDIT AVAILABLE:
Direct credit (WHT):        €112,500
Indirect credit (Corp tax): €250,000
                           ─────────
Total credit:              €362,500

But credit limited to R's tax on dividend:
R's tax: €225,000 (on €750,000 at 30%)
Credit allowed: €225,000 (limited)
Excess credit: €137,500 (lost or carried forward)

Tax payable in R: €0 (after credit)
Total tax: €250,000 + €112,500 = €362,500
Effective rate: 36.25%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Note that the calculation requires "grossing up" the dividend to include the underlying tax. This is conceptually similar to treating the parent as having received not the net dividend but the full pre-tax profits attributable to its shareholding. The gross-up ensures that the credit limitation is calculated on a comparable basis—without it, the credit could exceed the residence-state tax on the actual dividend received.

### 3. Conditions for Indirect Credit

Indirect credit is typically available only when certain conditions are met. These conditions reflect both practical administration concerns and policy choices about which relationships justify treating separate entities as an economic unit:

| Condition | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Minimum shareholding** | Usually 10-25% of voting shares to qualify |
| **Direct holding** | Parent must directly own subsidiary shares |
| **Dividend actually paid** | Not available for retained profits |
| **Tax actually paid** | By subsidiary (not tax spared) |
| **Treaty provision** | Must be specifically provided in treaty |

The minimum shareholding requirement is particularly significant. A portfolio investor holding 2% of a foreign company's shares does not receive indirect credit—only the direct credit for WHT applies. This reflects a judgment that small shareholders do not have the kind of economic integration with the company that justifies looking through the corporate form. The 10-25% threshold roughly corresponds to what most tax systems consider a "substantial" or "controlling" interest.

**Note**: The OECD Model does not specifically mandate indirect credit. Article 23B provides for credit of tax "paid in the other State," which some interpret as including underlying tax. However, many treaties explicitly include indirect credit provisions to remove any ambiguity. The absence of explicit provision has led to litigation in some jurisdictions over whether indirect credit is implicitly available.

### 4. Multi-Tier Indirect Credit

The logic of indirect credit creates a further question: what about taxes paid by the subsidiary's subsidiary? If we're treating the group as an economic unit, shouldn't we look through multiple layers?

Some countries extend indirect credit through **multiple tiers** of subsidiaries:

```
MULTI-TIER STRUCTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    PARENT (Country R)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 1 (Country A)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 2 (Country B)
         │
         │ 100%
         ▼
    SUB 3 (Country C) ← Operating company earning profits

US (pre-2017): Indirect credit available through 6 tiers
UK: Generally available for direct subsidiaries only
Many countries: Limited to 2-3 tiers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The US approach of allowing six tiers of look-through was among the most generous in the world, reflecting American multinationals' complex global structures. However, this generosity also created planning opportunities—companies could structure to maximize creditable taxes while minimizing actual tax burdens. The 2017 tax reform's move to a participation exemption largely eliminated indirect credit for US shareholders, replacing the credit system's complexity with territorial simplicity.

## C. TAX SPARING CREDITS

### 1. The Concept and Rationale

**Tax sparing** is perhaps the most controversial credit mechanism in international taxation. It emerged from the development economics debates of the 1960s and 1970s, when newly independent nations sought to attract foreign investment through tax incentives, only to find that the credit method in investors' home countries neutralized these incentives.

The problem Tax Sparing addresses reveals a fundamental tension in the international tax system. When a developing country offers a tax holiday or reduced rate to attract foreign investment, the benefit may be "clawed back" by the residence state through the credit method:

```
TAX INCENTIVE "CLAW-BACK" PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Developing Country S offers 10-year tax holiday to attract investment
Normal S rate: 30%
Country R (investor residence) rate: 35%

WITHOUT TAX SPARING:
─────────────────────
Income in S:            $1,000,000
S tax (holiday):        $0
R tax on worldwide:     $350,000
Credit for S tax:       $0 (none paid)
─────────────────────────────────
Final tax in R:         $350,000

RESULT: Tax holiday benefit captured by Country R, not investor
        S loses revenue but investor gets no benefit
        Investment incentive is negated

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This outcome troubled development economists. Country S was sacrificing revenue to attract investment, but the fiscal benefit was simply transferred to Country R's treasury rather than to the investor. Country S bore the cost; Country R reaped the reward. For developing countries, this seemed like yet another instance of the international economic system favoring wealthy nations.

### 2. How Tax Sparing Works

With a **tax sparing credit**, the residence state grants a credit for the tax that **would have been paid** in the source state but for the incentive:

```
TAX SPARING SOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITH TAX SPARING:
─────────────────────
Income in S:                $1,000,000
S tax (holiday):            $0
S tax that WOULD have been paid: $300,000 (30% normal rate)

R tax on worldwide:         $350,000
Tax sparing credit:         $300,000 (deemed tax)
─────────────────────────────────────
Final tax in R:             $50,000

RESULT: Investor benefits from incentive ($250,000 saving)
        S achieves investment attraction goal
        R bears cost of preserving incentive

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Notice what has happened here: Country R has effectively agreed to sacrifice its own revenue to support Country S's development policy. This is a remarkable act of international cooperation—or, depending on your perspective, an inappropriate subsidy to investors in low-tax jurisdictions.

### 3. Tax Sparing in Treaties

Tax sparing provisions are included through **specific treaty articles** or protocols:

**Example Treaty Language**:
> "Where a resident of [State A] derives income from [State B] and such income is exempt from tax or taxed at a reduced rate in [State B] under the laws of [State B] designed to promote economic development, [State A] shall allow a credit against its tax as if [State B] had levied tax at the rate of [X]%."

The specificity of treaty language matters enormously. Tax sparing provisions must identify which incentives qualify, what deemed rate applies, and how long the sparing continues. Poorly drafted provisions have led to disputes and abuse, as taxpayers sought to extend sparing beyond its intended scope.

### 4. Arguments For and Against Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has always been contentious. The debate reflects deeper disagreements about the proper relationship between developed and developing countries in the international tax system:

| Arguments FOR Tax Sparing | Arguments AGAINST Tax Sparing |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Preserves developing country incentives | Creates revenue loss for residence states |
| Promotes international investment | May subsidize inefficient investment |
| Supports development goals | Encourages "tax holidays" which may be harmful |
| Recognized by UN Model | Can be abused through aggressive planning |
| Historical use by major economies | Difficult to administer and verify |

Supporters argue that developing countries have the sovereign right to use tax policy as a development tool, and that residence states should not undermine these choices. Without tax sparing, developing countries are effectively forced to choose between higher tax rates (to ensure investors get no benefit from incentives) or zero tax rates (to ensure investors keep all the benefit)—neither of which may be optimal.

Critics counter that tax sparing distorts investment decisions, encouraging projects that make sense only because of the tax benefit rather than genuine economic merit. They also note that tax incentives themselves are often poor development policy—the OECD and IMF have documented how tax holidays can create distortions, encourage rent-seeking, and erode the tax base without delivering promised investment benefits.

### 5. The Decline of Tax Sparing

Tax sparing has become **less common** in modern treaty practice, reflecting a shift in both economic thinking and political will:

| Factor | Impact on Tax Sparing |
|--------|----------------------|
| **OECD skepticism** | 1998 OECD Report questioned effectiveness |
| **BEPS concerns** | Tax sparing can facilitate BEPS structures |
| **Territorial systems** | Many countries now exempt foreign income, making sparing unnecessary |
| **Harmful tax practices** | Incentives subject to FHTP review |
| **US policy** | US has never granted tax sparing in treaties |

The 1998 OECD Report on Tax Sparing marked a turning point. It compiled evidence suggesting that tax sparing provisions had limited effect on investment decisions, which were driven more by market access, infrastructure, and rule of law than by tax savings. The report also documented abuse cases where tax sparing credit had been claimed on income that was never taxed anywhere.

The BEPS project further accelerated the decline. Action 5 on Harmful Tax Practices scrutinizes precisely the kind of preferential regimes that tax sparing was designed to preserve. It became intellectually untenable to advocate against harmful tax competition in one context while supporting tax sparing in another.

**Current Status**: Tax sparing is still found in:
- Older treaties that haven't been renegotiated
- Treaties between developed and developing countries (especially UN Model-based)
- Some Asian treaties (Japan, Korea with developing partners)
- UK treaties with certain Commonwealth nations

However, new treaties rarely include tax sparing, and existing provisions are often removed during renegotiation. The global minimum tax under Pillar Two may effectively eliminate the remaining rationale for tax sparing by establishing a floor rate that makes source-country incentives less relevant.

## D. CREDIT LIMITATIONS AND BASKETS

### 1. Overall Limitation vs Per-Country Limitation

Countries using the credit method must make a policy choice about how to calculate the credit limitation. This choice has significant implications for taxpayers with operations in multiple foreign countries:

```
LIMITATION APPROACHES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Taxpayer earns income in two foreign countries
          Home rate: 30%

          Country A: €100,000 income, 40% tax = €40,000 tax
          Country B: €100,000 income, 10% tax = €10,000 tax

OVERALL LIMITATION:
───────────────────
Total foreign income: €200,000
Home tax on foreign income: €200,000 × 30% = €60,000
Total foreign tax: €50,000
Credit allowed: €50,000 (within limit)
Net effect: High and low tax countries averaged

PER-COUNTRY LIMITATION:
───────────────────────
Country A: Credit limit = €30,000, tax paid €40,000
           Credit = €30,000, excess €10,000 lost
Country B: Credit limit = €30,000, tax paid €10,000
           Credit = €10,000
Total credit: €40,000
Net effect: Excess credits cannot offset low-tax income

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The policy implications are significant. Overall limitation is more favorable to taxpayers because it allows "cross-crediting"—excess credits from high-tax countries can offset the surplus capacity created by low-tax countries. Per-country limitation prevents this averaging, ensuring that each country's effective tax rate is at least the residence-state rate.

Why might a country choose overall limitation? It simplifies administration and reduces the bias against high-tax countries. Why per-country? It prevents planning strategies that deliberately generate income in high-tax jurisdictions to create credits that shelter low-tax income. Most countries have shifted toward limiting cross-crediting opportunities over time, recognizing that overall limitation creates planning opportunities.

### 2. Basket Systems (US Approach)

The US approach illustrates how credit limitation can be refined to prevent specific planning strategies. Rather than simply choosing between overall and per-country limitation, the US uses a **basket system** that segregates foreign income into categories:

| Basket | Income Types | Limitation |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Passive** | Dividends, interest, royalties, rents | Separate limit |
| **General** | Active business income | Separate limit |
| **GILTI** | Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income | 80% credit only |
| **Branch** | Branch profits | Separate limit |

**Purpose**: Prevents "cross-crediting" where high-tax active income credits offset low-tax passive income.

The basket system reflects a judgment that different types of income have different tax profiles and should not be averaged together. Passive income is typically lightly taxed abroad (withholding rates of 5-15%), while active business income may face full corporate rates (20-30%+). Without baskets, a company could generate high-tax manufacturing income specifically to create credits that shelter low-tax royalty income.

The GILTI basket deserves special mention. Created by the 2017 tax reform, GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) represents a new category that captures income from intangible assets—precisely the type of income that has been most mobile in BEPS structures. The 80% credit limitation ensures that there is always some US tax on GILTI, even if foreign taxes are high.

### 3. Excess Credit Carryover

When foreign tax exceeds the credit limitation, most countries provide relief through carryover mechanisms:

| Treatment | Countries Using |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Carry forward** | UK (unlimited), US (10 years), most OECD |
| **Carry back** | US (1 year), some others |
| **Lost** | Some developing countries |

Carryover provisions recognize that tax timing can vary between countries, and that denying credit simply because of timing mismatch would be harsh. A company might pay high foreign taxes in Year 1 (perhaps due to timing differences in depreciation) and low foreign taxes in Year 2; carryover allows the Year 1 excess to offset the Year 2 surplus capacity.

The length of carryover periods varies significantly. The UK's unlimited carryforward is unusually generous, reflecting a policy choice that excess credits should never expire merely due to timing. The US 10-year period is more common internationally. Some developing countries allow no carryover at all, which can result in permanent double taxation when foreign rates exceed domestic rates—a harshness that discourages inward investment from those jurisdictions.

## E. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLES

### Worked Example 1: Direct vs Indirect Credit Comparison

**Scenario** (15 marks):

ParentCo, resident in Country P (corporate rate 25%), owns 100% of SubCo in Country S (corporate rate 20%). SubCo earns profits of €2,000,000 and pays dividends of €1,200,000 to ParentCo. Country S levies 10% WHT on dividends. The P-S treaty follows the OECD Model.

**Required**:
(a) Calculate ParentCo's tax position with direct credit only (5 marks)
(b) Calculate ParentCo's tax position with indirect (underlying) credit (5 marks)
(c) Explain the policy rationale for indirect credit (5 marks)

**Model Answer**:

**(a) Direct Credit Only (5 marks)**

```
Step 1: SubCo's position
Pre-tax profits:                     €2,000,000
Country S corporate tax (20%):       (€400,000)
After-tax profits:                   €1,600,000
Dividend declared:                   €1,200,000

Step 2: WHT on dividend
Gross dividend:                      €1,200,000
WHT (10%):                          (€120,000)
Net dividend received:               €1,080,000

Step 3: ParentCo's tax liability
Taxable dividend income:             €1,200,000
Country P tax (25%):                 €300,000
Direct credit (WHT only):           (€120,000)
Tax payable in P:                    €180,000

Step 4: Total tax burden
SubCo corporate tax:                 €400,000 × (1,200/1,600) = €300,000 (attributable)
WHT:                                 €120,000
ParentCo tax:                        €180,000
Total:                               €600,000

Effective rate: €600,000 / €1,500,000 gross-up = 40% ← Excessive
```

**(b) With Indirect Credit (5 marks)**

```
Step 1: Calculate underlying tax
Underlying tax = (Dividend / After-tax profits) × Corporate tax
               = (€1,200,000 / €1,600,000) × €400,000
               = €300,000

Step 2: Total credit available
Direct credit (WHT):                 €120,000
Indirect credit (underlying):        €300,000
Total potential credit:              €420,000

Step 3: Credit limitation
Grossed-up dividend: €1,200,000 + €300,000 = €1,500,000
Country P tax on gross-up: €1,500,000 × 25% = €375,000
Maximum credit: €375,000
Credit allowed: €375,000 (limited)
Excess credit: €45,000 (carried forward)

Step 4: Tax payable
Country P tax:                       €375,000
Less credit:                        (€375,000)
Tax payable in P:                    €0

Step 5: Total tax burden
SubCo corporate tax (attributable):  €300,000
WHT:                                 €120,000
ParentCo tax:                        €0
Total:                               €420,000

Effective rate: €420,000 / €1,500,000 = 28%

**(c) Policy Rationale for Indirect Credit (5 marks)**

The indirect credit exists to address **economic double taxation** that arises when corporate profits are taxed at both the subsidiary level and again when distributed as dividends to the parent.

**Key policy justifications**:

1. **Economic integration**: The parent and subsidiary form an economic unit; taxing the same profits at both levels creates an excessive burden that would discourage cross-border investment. The 40% effective rate without indirect credit demonstrates how punitive pure direct credit can be.

2. **Competitive neutrality**: Without indirect credit, a domestic subsidiary would be taxed once (corporation tax), while a foreign subsidiary's profits would face multiple layers of tax, distorting investment decisions. Companies should not be penalized for using subsidiary structures rather than branches.

3. **Capital export neutrality**: The credit method aims to ensure investors face the same tax burden regardless of where they invest. Without indirect credit, this neutrality is compromised for subsidiary structures—the same investment would be taxed more heavily simply because of organizational form.

4. **Prevention of discriminatory effects**: Requiring investors to use branch structures (which get full credit) to avoid double taxation would distort business organization choices. Subsidiaries offer advantages in liability limitation and local regulatory compliance that should not be tax-disadvantaged.

**Limitations**: Indirect credit is administratively complex, requiring verification of foreign subsidiary accounts and tax payments across potentially multiple tiers. It also raises questions about which relationships are sufficiently integrated to justify look-through treatment—hence the minimum shareholding requirements most countries impose.

### Worked Example 2: Tax Sparing Analysis

**Scenario** (10 marks):

Country D is a developing country that offers a 5-year tax holiday for manufacturing investments. InvestorCo, resident in Country R (rate 35%), invests in Country D. Without the holiday, Country D's rate would be 25%. InvestorCo earns $5,000,000 in Year 1.

**Required**:
(a) Calculate InvestorCo's position with and without tax sparing (5 marks)
(b) Discuss the arguments for and against tax sparing provisions (5 marks)

**Model Answer**:

**(a) Calculation (5 marks)**

```
WITHOUT TAX SPARING:
────────────────────
Income in D:                         $5,000,000
D tax (holiday):                     $0
R tax (35%):                         $1,750,000
Credit for D tax:                    $0
Net R tax:                           $1,750,000
Total tax: $1,750,000 (effective rate 35%)
Investor benefit from holiday: $0

WITH TAX SPARING:
─────────────────
Income in D:                         $5,000,000
D tax (holiday):                     $0
"Deemed" D tax (25%):                $1,250,000
R tax (35%):                         $1,750,000
Tax sparing credit:                  $1,250,000
Net R tax:                           $500,000
Total tax: $500,000 (effective rate 10%)
Investor benefit from holiday: $1,250,000
```

**(b) Arguments For and Against Tax Sparing (5 marks)**

**Arguments FOR**:

1. **Preserves incentive effectiveness**: Without tax sparing, Country D loses revenue but InvestorCo gains nothing—the benefit transfers to Country R's treasury. Tax sparing ensures the incentive actually influences investment behavior, which is its intended purpose.

2. **Supports development goals**: Developing countries often have limited policy tools to attract investment and technology transfer. Tax sparing respects their sovereignty to use fiscal incentives, rather than allowing residence countries to neutralize these choices.

3. **Historical precedent**: The UN Model explicitly provides for tax sparing, reflecting developing country priorities. Major economies including Japan, UK, and France have historically granted sparing in treaties with developing partners.

**Arguments AGAINST**:

1. **Revenue cost to residence state**: Country R effectively subsidizes Country D's development policy. R's taxpayers bear the cost of foregone revenue, even though they have no say in D's policy choices and may not benefit from D's development.

2. **Encourages harmful competition**: Tax sparing can encourage "races to the bottom" where developing countries compete through ever-more generous incentives. This erodes tax bases globally and may not actually increase total investment—it may simply redistribute investment among competing low-tax locations.

3. **Administrative complexity**: Verifying which income qualifies for sparing and calculating deemed taxes adds compliance burden for both taxpayers and tax authorities. The potential for abuse is significant when credit is available for taxes never paid.

4. **BEPS concerns**: Tax sparing can be exploited in aggressive structures where income is routed through incentive regimes to generate credits without genuine economic activity. The 1998 OECD Report documented numerous abuse cases.

5. **Questionable effectiveness**: OECD and academic research suggests tax is not the primary driver of investment decisions—market access, infrastructure, rule of law, and human capital matter more. Tax sparing may subsidize investment that would have occurred anyway.

**Current trend**: Tax sparing is declining as developed countries move to territorial systems (where exemption achieves similar outcomes) and as the BEPS agenda delegitimizes the preferential regimes that sparing was designed to preserve. Pillar Two's 15% minimum tax may effectively eliminate remaining rationales.

## F. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
ESSENTIAL POINTS TO REMEMBER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. THREE TYPES OF CREDIT:
   • Direct: Credit for tax paid directly by taxpayer
   • Indirect: Credit for underlying corporate tax on dividends
   • Tax sparing: Credit for tax that would have been paid

2. DIRECT CREDIT applies to:
   • Employment income tax
   • Branch profits tax
   • WHT on dividends, interest, royalties

3. INDIRECT CREDIT:
   • Addresses economic double taxation on dividends
   • Formula: (Dividend/After-tax profits) × Corporate tax
   • Requires minimum shareholding (10-25%)
   • Conceptually treats parent-subsidiary as economic unit

4. TAX SPARING:
   • Preserves developing country incentives
   • Credit for "deemed" tax not actually paid
   • Declining in modern treaty practice
   • BEPS concerns and Pillar Two accelerating decline

5. CREDIT LIMITATIONS:
   • Overall vs per-country calculation affects cross-crediting
   • Basket systems (US) segregate income types
   • Excess credits typically carry forward

6. POLICY TENSIONS:
   • Direct vs indirect credit: Should legal form affect tax burden?
   • Tax sparing: Who bears cost of development incentives?
   • Limitations: Prevent planning vs simplify compliance?
