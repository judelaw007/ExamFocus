## 1. Historical Context: Why International Tax Coordination Began

### 1. The Post-WWI Tax Environment

Before World War I, income tax rates were relatively low across most countries, and double taxation was not a significant concern. The war changed this dramatically:

| Period | Tax Rate Context | Impact |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Pre-WWI** | Low rates (often <10%) | Double taxation minor issue |
| **WWI** | Dramatic increases to fund war | UK corporate tax ~20%, Germany ~20%, France ~15% |
| **Post-WWI** | Rates remained elevated | Double taxation became barrier to trade and investment |

The need for revenue during and after the war led countries to strengthen their tax systems and expand their tax bases. When multiple countries taxed the same income, the combined burden became a significant obstacle to international commerce.

### 2. The Recognised Problem

By the early 1920s, governments recognised that double taxation:
- Created barriers to international trade and investment
- Discouraged the flow of capital across borders
- Put internationally active businesses at a competitive disadvantage
- Required coordinated solutions rather than purely unilateral action

As Mitchell B. Carroll noted in 1927, preventative measures were needed to "lighten the drag on international trade and the circulation of capital."

## 2. The League of Nations' Approach

### 1. Institutional Framework

The League of Nations, established in 1920, became the first international organisation to systematically address double taxation. Work proceeded through several bodies:

```
LEAGUE OF NATIONS TAX WORK STRUCTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                    FINANCIAL COMMITTEE
                    (Policy oversight)
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
           ▼               ▼               ▼
    ECONOMISTS'      TECHNICAL        FISCAL
    COMMITTEE        EXPERTS          COMMITTEE
    (1921-1923)      (1922-1928)      (1929 onwards)
           │               │               │
           ▼               ▼               ▼
    1923 Report      1928 Model       Further
    on Double        Conventions      Development
    Taxation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. The Four Economists' Report (1923)

In 1921, the Financial Committee commissioned four eminent economists to study double taxation:

| Economist | Country | Expertise |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **G.W.J. Bruins** | Netherlands | Public finance |
| **Luigi Einaudi** | Italy | Economics, later President of Italy |
| **Edwin Seligman** | United States | Public finance |
| **Sir Josiah Stamp** | United Kingdom | Economics and taxation |

**Key conclusions of the 1923 Report:**

1. **Double taxation is a barrier** to international investment that should be eliminated
2. **Economic allegiance** should determine taxing rights (connection between taxpayer and state)
3. **Classification approach**: Different types of income should be allocated to different states
4. **Source vs residence**: The Report considered both principles but did not conclusively favour one
5. **Function of tax treaties**: To promote investment by removing the double taxation barrier

The Report laid the intellectual foundations for the allocation of taxing rights between residence and source states—concepts that remain central to modern tax treaties.

### 3. The Committee of Technical Experts (1922-1928)

While the economists addressed principles, the Technical Experts addressed practical implementation:

- Comprised senior tax officials from various countries
- Focused on administrative aspects of double taxation
- Developed draft model conventions
- Addressed tax evasion alongside double taxation

**Key figure**: Mitchell B. Carroll (United States) played a dominant role despite the US not being a League member. He later became:
- Secretary of the League's Fiscal Committee
- First President of the International Fiscal Association (IFA)
- Author of extensive studies on profit allocation

---

## 3. The 1928 Model Conventions

### 1. Three Models Adopted

In October 1928, a General Meeting of Government Experts in Geneva produced **three model conventions**:

| Model | Focus | Significance |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Model on Income and Capital** | Direct taxes on income and wealth | Foundation for OECD and UN Models |
| **Model on Succession Duties** | Inheritance/estate taxes | Less influential today |
| **Model on Administrative Assistance** | Exchange of information, collection | Precursor to Article 26 OECD MTC |

### 2. Key Features of the 1928 Income Model

The 1928 Model on Income and Capital established several principles still found in modern treaties:

**Classification approach:**
- Different types of income allocated to different states
- Rejected exclusive residence or source taxation
- Created schedular system of distributive rules

**Source/residence balance:**
- Business profits: taxable where permanent establishment exists
- Investment income: generally residence state, with source state retention
- Real property: source state

**Modern legacy:**
- Structure of separate articles for different income types
- Permanent establishment concept
- Methods of eliminating double taxation

```
EXAM TIP: League to OECD Continuity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If asked about the history of tax treaties, the key point is:

CONTINUITY: The League's 1928 Models → OEEC (1958) → OECD (1963+)

The basic architecture established in 1928 continues in the current
OECD Model Tax Convention:
• Schedular approach (different articles for different income)
• Residence/source allocation
• Permanent establishment concept
• Methods to eliminate double taxation

You do NOT need detailed knowledge of the 1928 provisions—just
understand they established the FOUNDATION for modern treaties.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. The Mexico and London Models (1940s)

Work continued through the 1930s and 1940s despite the League's declining influence:

| Model | Year | Notable Features |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Mexico Model** | 1943 | Stronger source state rights; influenced by Latin American countries |
| **London Model** | 1946 | More balanced; closer to 1928 approach |

These models attempted to address developing country concerns—a tension that continues in the OECD vs UN Model distinction today.

## 4. Transition to Successor Organisations

### 1. From League to UN and OEEC/OECD

After World War II, the League of Nations dissolved (1946), and its tax work was transferred:

```
INSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LEAGUE OF NATIONS (1920-1946)
              │
              │ Work transferred to:
              │
    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
    ▼                   ▼
UNITED NATIONS      OEEC (1948)
Tax Experts             │
(Limited activity)      ▼
    │              OECD (1961)
    ▼                   │
UN Tax Committee        ▼
(1968 onwards)     OECD Committee on
                   Fiscal Affairs
                   (Dominant role)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Why OECD Became Dominant

Capital-exporting countries (especially US and UK) influenced the shift of tax treaty work to the OEEC/OECD rather than the UN:

- **OEEC/OECD membership**: Primarily developed, capital-exporting countries
- **Common interests**: Members shared perspective on protecting residence-state taxation
- **Technical capacity**: Concentrated expertise in fiscal matters
- **US influence**: Despite not being League member, US shaped international tax norms through key individuals like Carroll

The UN's tax work would develop separately (covered in Chapter 7.3), eventually producing its own Model Convention with stronger source-state provisions.

## 5. Legacy and Continuing Relevance

### 1. Enduring Concepts from the League Era

Several concepts established in the 1920s remain foundational:

| Concept | Origin | Modern Relevance |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| **Schedular allocation** | 1928 Models | Articles 6-21 OECD MTC |
| **Permanent establishment** | 1920s development | Article 5 OECD MTC |
| **Residence/source balance** | 1923 Economists' Report | Fundamental treaty structure |
| **Exchange of information** | 1928 Administrative Model | Article 26 OECD MTC |
| **Credit and exemption methods** | 1920s discussions | Articles 23A/23B OECD MTC |

### 2. Historical Arguments in Modern Debates

Understanding the League's work provides context for modern debates:

- **BEPS concerns**: The League faced similar issues (tax avoidance alongside double taxation)
- **Developing country voice**: Mexico Model showed early developing country concerns
- **Multilateral vs bilateral**: League considered multilateral conventions (achieved partially with MLI in 2016)
- **Business influence**: International Chamber of Commerce influenced League work, as business continues to influence OECD

## 7. Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Spending too much time on history | Level 1 topic; low marks available | Brief context only; move to substantive issues |
| Not knowing League existed | Missing foundational knowledge | Know League started modern treaty development |
| Confusing League with OECD timeline | Shows weak understanding | League (1920s-40s) → OEEC (1948) → OECD (1961) |
| Over-detailing economists' names | Not tested at this level | Mention "committee of economists" is sufficient |
