## Chapter 7.1: Work Under the League of Nations

### 1. The Post-War Context for International Tax Coordination

Before World War I, income tax rates were relatively low across most countries, typically below ten percent. Double taxation—the same income being taxed by two jurisdictions—existed but was not a significant concern given the modest rates involved. The war fundamentally changed this situation. Governments dramatically increased tax rates to fund military expenditures, with corporate tax rates reaching twenty percent or higher in major economies. These elevated rates persisted after the war as governments faced reconstruction costs and war debt obligations.

When multiple countries asserted taxing rights over the same income at these higher rates, the cumulative burden became a substantial obstacle to international commerce. Businesses operating across borders faced effective tax rates far exceeding what any single jurisdiction would impose. Governments recognised that double taxation created barriers to international trade and investment, discouraged capital flows, and put internationally active businesses at competitive disadvantage compared to purely domestic enterprises. Unilateral solutions proved inadequate; coordinated international action was required.

The League of Nations, established in 1920, became the first international organisation to systematically address this problem. Its work on double taxation laid the foundations for the international tax treaty system that continues to govern cross-border taxation today. *(covered in December 2022)*

### 2. The League of Nations' Approach

#### 2.1. The 1923 Economists' Report

In 1921, the League's Financial Committee commissioned four eminent economists to study double taxation and propose solutions. The group comprised Professor G.W.J. Bruins from the Netherlands, Senator Luigi Einaudi from Italy who would later become President of the Italian Republic, Professor Edwin Seligman from Columbia University in the United States, and Sir Josiah Stamp from the United Kingdom. Their report, submitted in 1923, established the intellectual foundations for allocating taxing rights between jurisdictions.

The economists concluded that double taxation constituted a barrier to international investment requiring elimination. They introduced the concept of economic allegiance—the connection between a taxpayer and a state that justifies taxation—and proposed that different types of income should be allocated to different states based on the nature of the connection. The report considered both residence-based and source-based taxation without conclusively favouring either, recognising that both reflected legitimate claims to tax. This balanced approach would characterise the treaty framework that emerged.

The economists' work established that international tax coordination should not simply favour one principle over another but should instead develop rules allocating different categories of income based on the nature of each income type and the connections it creates between taxpayer and jurisdiction. This classification or schedular approach remains the foundation of modern tax treaties.

#### 2.2. The Committee of Technical Experts

While the economists addressed principles, the League established a Committee of Technical Experts comprising senior tax officials from various countries to develop practical implementation mechanisms. This committee, active from 1922 through 1928, focused on the administrative aspects of double taxation relief and developed draft model conventions that could serve as templates for bilateral negotiations.

The Technical Experts also addressed tax evasion alongside double taxation, recognising from the outset that the two problems were connected. Arrangements designed to avoid taxation in one jurisdiction often produced double taxation concerns in another, and mechanisms for sharing information between tax authorities served both objectives.

Mitchell B. Carroll from the United States played a particularly influential role despite the United States not being a League member. He later became Secretary of the League's Fiscal Committee and the first President of the International Fiscal Association, contributing extensively to studies on the allocation of profits between related enterprises—work that prefigured modern transfer pricing rules.

### 3. The 1928 Model Conventions

#### 3.1. Three Models Adopted

In October 1928, a General Meeting of Government Experts in Geneva adopted three model conventions that would shape international tax practice for decades. The Model Convention on Income and Capital addressed direct taxes and established the architecture still visible in modern treaties. The Model Convention on Succession Duties addressed inheritance and estate taxes, though this proved less influential over time. The Model Convention on Administrative Assistance addressed exchange of information and mutual assistance in tax collection, establishing principles that evolved into Article 26 of the OECD Model and eventually the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance.

#### 3.2. Enduring Principles

The 1928 Model on Income and Capital established several principles that remain fundamental to treaty practice. It adopted the classification approach the economists had proposed, creating separate rules for different income categories rather than a single overarching principle. Business profits would be taxable where a permanent establishment existed. Investment income would generally be taxed primarily by the residence state, though the source state might retain limited taxing rights. Income from immovable property would be taxable at source.

The model also established structures for eliminating double taxation once taxing rights were allocated, contemplating both credit and exemption methods. These provisions evolved into Articles 23A and 23B of the modern OECD Model.

Work continued through the 1930s and 1940s despite the League's declining influence. The Mexico Model of 1943 reflected stronger source-state rights influenced by Latin American countries, while the London Model of 1946 returned to a more balanced approach. These variations foreshadowed the continuing tension between residence and source perspectives that distinguishes the OECD and UN Models today.

### 4. Transition to Successor Organisations

When the League of Nations dissolved in 1946, its tax work transferred to successor organisations. The United Nations inherited some responsibilities but devoted limited attention to tax matters in its early decades. The more significant development occurred through the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, established in 1948 to administer Marshall Plan assistance.

The OEEC, and its successor the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from 1961, took over development of model tax conventions. Capital-exporting countries, particularly from Western Europe and North America, preferred working through an organisation where they held greater influence than in the broader United Nations. The OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs became the primary forum for developing international tax norms, publishing successive versions of the OECD Model Tax Convention that directly descend from the League's 1928 work.

The basic architecture established in 1928—the schedular approach allocating different income types under different rules, the permanent establishment concept, the residence and source allocation framework, the credit and exemption methods for eliminating double taxation—continues in the current OECD Model. Understanding the League's work provides historical context for principles that might otherwise appear arbitrary, revealing them instead as considered solutions to problems identified a century ago that remain relevant today.
