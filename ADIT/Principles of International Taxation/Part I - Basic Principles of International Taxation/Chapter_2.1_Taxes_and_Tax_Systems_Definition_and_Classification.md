## 2.1. Definition and Classification of Taxes

### 2.1.1. What is a Tax?

A tax is a compulsory financial charge imposed by a governmental organisation on individuals or entities to fund government expenditure and public services. Understanding what constitutes a "tax" is essential for determining whether a charge falls within the scope of tax treaties.

**Key Characteristics of a Tax:**

| Characteristic | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Compulsory** | Not voluntary—backed by legal authority and enforcement |
| **Unrequited** | Not paid in exchange for specific services (unlike fees) |
| **Legally imposed** | Established by legislation, not contract |
| **For public purposes** | Funds government expenditure and public goods |

**Distinguishing Taxes from Other Charges:**

| Charge Type | Key Difference from Tax |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Fee** | Paid for specific service received (e.g., passport fee) |
| **Fine/Penalty** | Punishment for wrongdoing, not revenue-raising |
| **Tariff** | Specifically on imports/exports |
| **Duty** | Often used interchangeably with tax, especially customs |

Article 2 of the OECD Model Tax Convention defines which taxes are "covered" by the treaty. Understanding what constitutes a "tax" helps determine whether a particular charge qualifies for treaty benefits.

### 2.1.2. Classification of Taxes

Taxes can be classified in multiple ways. These classifications are important for analysing treaty provisions and understanding how different taxes operate within domestic and international tax systems.

#### 2.1.2.1. Direct and Indirect Taxes

The distinction between direct and indirect taxes is fundamental to understanding treaty coverage.

| Direct Taxes | Indirect Taxes |
|--------------|----------------|
| Paid directly to government by the taxpayer | Collected by intermediary, borne by end consumer |
| Based on ability to pay | Based on consumption or transactions |
| Cannot be shifted to others | Can be shifted (passed on in prices) |
| **Examples**: Income tax, corporate tax, wealth tax | **Examples**: VAT, sales tax, customs duties, excise |

Double Tax Conventions primarily cover direct taxes on income and capital. Article 2(2) of the OECD MTC specifies that covered taxes include "all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital, or on elements of income or of capital." Indirect taxes such as VAT and customs duties are generally not covered by DTCs.

#### 2.1.2.2. Rate Structures

Taxes can also be classified by how rates change with the tax base:

| Type | Rate Behaviour | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Progressive** | Rate increases as income increases | Individual income tax with brackets |
| **Proportional** (Flat) | Same rate regardless of income | Flat corporate tax rate |
| **Regressive** | Effective rate decreases as income increases | Sales tax (takes larger percentage of lower incomes) |

In a progressive system, the marginal tax rate exceeds the average tax rate. In a proportional system, they are equal. In a regressive system, the marginal rate is lower than the average rate.

#### 2.1.2.3. Tax Bases

The tax base determines what is measured and taxed:

| Tax Base | What Is Taxed | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Income** | Earnings from labour, capital, business | Personal income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax |
| **Consumption** | Spending on goods and services | VAT, GST, sales tax, excise duties |
| **Property/Wealth** | Assets owned | Real property tax, wealth tax, inheritance tax |

### 2.1.3. Major Types of Taxes

Understanding the major categories of taxes provides the foundation for analysing how different charges are treated under domestic law and international agreements.

#### 2.1.3.1. Income Taxes

Income taxes form the primary focus of Double Tax Conventions. They are imposed on the earnings of individuals and entities:

| Type | Taxpayer | Typical Features |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Personal Income Tax** | Individuals | Progressive rates, personal allowances |
| **Corporate Income Tax** | Companies | Often flat rate, deductions for expenses |
| **Capital Gains Tax** | Individuals/entities | Tax on asset appreciation |
| **Withholding Tax** | Non-residents | Deducted at source on dividends, interest, royalties |

#### 2.1.3.2. Consumption Taxes

Consumption taxes operate differently from income taxes:

| Type | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Value Added Tax (VAT)** | Multi-stage, collected at each production stage |
| **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** | Similar to VAT, varies by jurisdiction |
| **Sales Tax** | Single-stage, usually at retail level |
| **Excise Duties** | Specific goods such as alcohol, tobacco, fuel |
| **Customs Duties** | Border levies on imports and exports |

#### 2.1.3.3. Property and Wealth Taxes

| Type | Tax Base |
|------|----------|
| **Real Property Tax** | Land and buildings |
| **Wealth Tax** | Net assets (relatively rare) |
| **Inheritance/Estate Tax** | Transfers at death |
| **Gift Tax** | Transfers during lifetime |
| **Stamp Duty** | Documents and transactions |

### 2.1.4. Treaty Relevance

The classification of taxes directly affects treaty application:

| Tax Type | Covered by DTCs? | Relevant OECD MTC Article |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Personal/Corporate income tax | Yes | Article 2, 7, 15 |
| Capital gains tax | Yes | Article 13 |
| Withholding taxes | Yes | Articles 10, 11, 12 |
| Wealth/capital tax | Yes | Article 22 |
| VAT/GST | No | Outside scope |
| Sales tax | No | Outside scope |
| Customs duties | No | Outside scope |

Understanding these classifications enables proper analysis of whether specific charges qualify for treaty benefits and which treaty provisions apply to particular types of income or capital.

The distinction between covered and non-covered taxes has practical significance. When a taxpayer faces both income tax and VAT on cross-border transactions, only the income tax component can be addressed through DTC provisions. Relief for indirect taxes must be sought through other mechanisms, such as VAT refund procedures or customs agreements.
