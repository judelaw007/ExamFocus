## Chapter 6.3: The Issue of Qualification and International Tax

### 1. What Is a Qualification Conflict?

The previous chapters established that states may differ on whether an entity exists as a legal person and whether an entity is treated as transparent or opaque for tax purposes. A qualification conflict arises at the next stage of analysis: when two contracting states apply different distributive rules to the same income and taxpayer because they interpret treaty terms differently. This creates situations where both states may claim taxing rights under different treaty provisions, or where each state may believe the other has primary taxing rights, leading to double taxation or double non-taxation respectively.

#### 1.1. The Mechanism of Qualification Conflicts

The fundamental problem arises because tax treaties use terms that may have different meanings in different domestic legal systems. When a payment flows from a company in State B to a person in State A, each state must characterise that payment to determine which treaty article applies. If State A views the payment as a royalty for use of intellectual property while State B views the same payment as a fee for services rendered, each state applies a different distributive article. State A applies Article 12 on royalties, potentially expecting exclusive residence-state taxation or limited source-state withholding, while State B applies Article 7 on business profits or the technical services provisions, claiming broader source-state taxing rights.

The consequence is that the treaty fails to achieve its fundamental purpose of allocating taxing rights clearly between the contracting states. Neither state may grant relief because each believes a different article governs the transaction, or both states may tax fully because each applies an article permitting taxation without adequate relief from the other.

#### 1.2. Why Qualification Conflicts Matter

Qualification conflicts create several practical difficulties. Double taxation may arise when both states tax the income and neither grants relief because each state applies a different article that does not contemplate the other state's taxation. Double non-taxation may occur when each state believes the other has primary taxing rights under the article it considers applicable. Taxpayers face uncertainty because they cannot predict which state will tax, at what rate, or whether relief will be available. Competent authorities may disagree on proper treaty application, requiring mutual agreement procedure resolution that can take years.

### 2. Article 3(2): The Renvoi to Domestic Law

Article 3(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides the default rule for interpreting treaty terms that are not defined within the treaty itself. The provision states that any term not defined in the treaty shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning it has under the law of the applying state for purposes of the taxes to which the treaty applies, with tax law meanings prevailing over general law meanings. The reference is ambulatory—meaning at the time of application rather than at the time the treaty was concluded.

#### 2.1. The Problem with Article 3(2)

Article 3(2) is frequently identified as the primary cause of qualification conflicts. The mechanism is straightforward: when a treaty uses an undefined term such as royalty, interest, or dividend, State A interprets that term according to State A's domestic law while State B interprets the same term according to State B's domestic law. If these domestic laws define the term differently, the states reach different interpretations, and different interpretations lead to different treaty articles being applied.

Consider software licence payments. Under State A's domestic law, payments for software licences may constitute royalties because they involve the use of copyright. Under State B's domestic law, the same payments may not qualify as royalties but rather as payments for the purchase of a product, constituting business profits. State A applies Article 12 while State B applies Article 7, creating a qualification conflict that the treaty structure does not directly resolve.

#### 2.2. The Context Otherwise Requires Exception

The critical qualifier in Article 3(2) is the phrase "unless the context otherwise requires." This exception permits departure from domestic law meaning in several circumstances. The treaty itself may provide contextual indicators suggesting a different interpretation. The OECD Commentary may offer guidance that both states accept as relevant context. The object and purpose of the treaty might be frustrated by applying divergent domestic meanings. An autonomous meaning may be derivable from the treaty's structure and language independent of either state's domestic law.

The 2017 update to the OECD Model added a further element: competent authorities may agree to a different meaning pursuant to Article 25, giving mutual agreement procedure outcomes priority over domestic law interpretation. This provides a mechanism for resolving qualification conflicts prospectively through competent authority agreement, though such agreements are not always available or practical to obtain.

### 3. Approaches to Treaty Interpretation

International tax scholarship identifies three principal approaches to interpreting undefined treaty terms, each with distinct advantages and limitations.

#### 3.1. Three Interpretive Approaches

The lex fori approach applies the domestic law of the state applying the treaty. This is essentially what Article 3(2) mandates as the default position. Each state applies its own domestic law meaning, providing certainty within each jurisdiction but creating the qualification conflicts discussed above when domestic laws differ.

The lex causae approach would have both states adopt the source state's characterisation of the income or transaction. This provides consistency because both states apply the same classification, and the source state—which has direct connection to the underlying transaction—controls the characterisation. However, this approach risks allowing the source state to expand its taxing rights through favourable characterisation and may conflict with the residence state's legitimate policy interests.

Autonomous interpretation derives meaning from the treaty's own context, object, and purpose rather than from either state's domestic law. This approach has theoretical appeal because it achieves genuinely common understanding between the treaty partners. In practice, however, autonomous interpretation proves difficult to apply consistently. Different interpreters may reach different conclusions about what the treaty context requires, and courts in different jurisdictions may develop divergent autonomous meanings over time.

#### 3.2. The Vienna Convention Framework

Tax treaties, as international agreements, are subject to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties interpretation rules. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention establishes the general rule: treaties are to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of terms in their context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose. Article 32 permits recourse to supplementary means of interpretation, including preparatory work, when Article 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure.

The relationship between Article 3(2) of the OECD Model and the Vienna Convention interpretation framework is contested. Some argue that the Vienna Convention takes precedence as general international law, with Article 3(2) operating as part of the treaty context to be considered under Vienna Convention principles. Others argue that Article 3(2) constitutes a lex specialis for tax treaties, displacing general Vienna Convention principles for undefined terms. The better view treats Article 3(2) as operating within the Vienna Convention framework rather than outside it—the "context otherwise requires" exception effectively incorporates Vienna Convention considerations into the Article 3(2) analysis (covered in June 2023).

#### 3.3. The Role of the OECD Commentary

The OECD Commentary provides extensive interpretive guidance on the Model Tax Convention provisions, but its legal status remains debated. Various characterisations have been proposed: the Commentary might constitute context under Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention if viewed as an agreement made between parties in connection with the treaty; it might constitute a subsequent agreement under Article 31(3)(a) when Commentary changes reflect state consensus; it might be treated as supplementary means under Article 32, equivalent to preparatory work; or it might have no binding status whatsoever, representing merely soft law with persuasive but not authoritative effect.

As a practical matter, courts give significant weight to the Commentary, particularly for treaties based closely on the OECD Model. The Commentary's influence on resolving qualification conflicts is substantial, even if its formal legal status remains unclear. Tax practitioners routinely rely on Commentary guidance when advising on treaty interpretation questions.

### 4. Types of Qualification Conflicts

Qualification conflicts arise from several distinct sources, each requiring somewhat different analytical approaches.

Entity qualification conflicts arise when states characterise entities differently as transparent or opaque, as discussed in Chapter 6.2. When State A treats a partnership as transparent and State B treats the same partnership as opaque, different taxpayers are identified as entitled to treaty benefits, and different articles may apply depending on whether the entity or its members are treated as receiving the income.

Income qualification conflicts arise when states characterise the nature of income differently. Classic examples include software licence payments that may be royalties or business profits, lease payments that may be royalties or income from immovable property, technical services fees that may be royalties or independent personal services income, and convertible bond payments that may be interest or dividends. The OECD addressed entity qualification conflicts through Article 1(2) of the 2017 Model, which provides that income of fiscally transparent entities shall be considered income of a resident to the extent that state treats the income as the income of a resident.

Fact qualification conflicts arise when states reach different factual conclusions about the same transaction. For example, one state may determine that activities constitute permanent establishment while the other considers them merely preparatory or auxiliary. Such conflicts arise not from different legal definitions but from different applications of the same legal standard to contested facts.

### 5. OECD Solutions to Qualification Conflicts

#### 5.1. The Partnership Report and Commentary Updates

The OECD addressed qualification conflicts systematically in its 1999 Partnership Report, which recommended that the residence state should follow the source state's characterisation and provide relief accordingly. The rationale was that this approach prevents the source state from manipulating characterisation to deny treaty benefits, provides certainty because the source state's view determines treaty application, and ensures the residence state grants relief based on the source state's actual taxation of the income.

The Commentary was updated in 2000 to incorporate this approach. The residence state should, as a general rule and subject to conditions, accept the source state's qualification of an item of income and provide relief accordingly. The conditions include that the source state has applied its domestic law correctly, that the source state's characterisation is not unreasonable, and that the taxpayer has actually been subject to tax in the source state.

#### 5.2. Limitations of the OECD Approach

The OECD solution has significant limitations. The Commentary is not binding law—it represents soft law guidance that states may deviate from in domestic legislation or court decisions. The approach creates a potential circular problem: what if the source state's characterisation is incorrect under proper treaty interpretation? The residence state's domestic law may not permit following foreign characterisation, particularly where this would reduce domestic tax revenue. And the source state characterisation may be less favourable to taxpayers than the residence state would otherwise apply.

These limitations mean that qualification conflicts continue to arise despite the OECD's efforts to provide coordinating principles. The mutual agreement procedure remains the ultimate fallback for resolving disputes that cannot be addressed through Commentary guidance.

### 6. Ambulatory Interpretation and Treaty Override

A distinctive feature of Article 3(2) is its ambulatory nature—undefined terms have the meaning they bear under domestic law at the time of application, not at the time the treaty was concluded. This creates the possibility that a state may change its domestic law after signing a treaty, thereby changing the meaning of treaty terms for purposes of that state's application.

The question arises whether such domestic law changes constitute treaty override. Two views exist. One view holds that this is not treaty override because Article 3(2) itself anticipates and authorises the use of domestic law as it stands from time to time. The ambulatory reference is built into the treaty structure, and subsequent domestic law changes operate within that contemplated framework. The alternative view argues that domestic law changes going beyond the treaty's context may constitute override, particularly if they fundamentally alter the bargain struck between treaty partners.

The "context otherwise requires" qualifier provides some constraint. Domestic law changes that would produce results inconsistent with the treaty's object and purpose may be excluded from the Article 3(2) reference because the context requires a different interpretation. This limits the extent to which ambulatory interpretation can be used to achieve results the treaty partners did not contemplate (covered in June 2023).

A specific application of this issue arises with controlled foreign company rules. The OECD Commentary takes the position that CFC rules are not contrary to the Model Tax Convention because they involve the residence state taxing its own residents, and when read in context, CFC rules do not conflict with treaty provisions. This interpretation illustrates how the "context otherwise requires" exception operates to preserve the coherence of the treaty system while accommodating legitimate domestic anti-avoidance measures.

Understanding qualification conflicts and their resolution is essential for applying tax treaties in practice. The interaction between treaty terms, domestic law definitions, and interpretive frameworks determines how taxing rights are actually allocated between treaty partners—and whether the treaty achieves its fundamental purpose of preventing double taxation while avoiding double non-taxation.
