## A. WHAT IS A "QUALIFICATION CONFLICT"?

### 1. Building on Recognition and Characterisation

Chapters 6.1 and 6.2 established that states may differ on:
- **Recognition**: Whether an entity exists as a legal person (Chapter 6.1)
- **Characterisation**: Whether an entity is transparent or opaque (Chapter 6.2)

A **qualification conflict** (also called a "conflict of qualification" or "characterisation conflict") arises at the next stage: when two contracting states apply **different distributive rules** to the **same income and taxpayer** because they interpret treaty terms differently.

The fundamental problem: if each state interprets treaty terms according to its own domestic law, they may reach different conclusions about which treaty article applies—leading to double taxation or double non-taxation.

### 2. The Core Mechanism

```
QUALIFICATION CONFLICT MECHANISM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Payment from Company B (State B) to Person A (State A)

STATE A'S VIEW                        STATE B'S VIEW
(Residence State)                     (Source State)
      │                                     │
      ▼                                     ▼
"This payment is a                   "This payment is a FEE
ROYALTY for use of                   FOR SERVICES rendered
intellectual property"               by Person A"
      │                                     │
      ▼                                     ▼
Applies Article 12                   Applies Article 7 or 14
(Royalties)                          (Business Profits/Services)
      │                                     │
      ▼                                     ▼
State A expects exclusive            State B claims source
taxing right OR limited              state taxing rights
source taxation
      │                                     │
      └────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   ▼
           QUALIFICATION CONFLICT
           • Different articles applied
           • Risk of double taxation
           • Relief mechanism unclear
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Why Qualification Conflicts Matter

Qualification conflicts can result in:

| Outcome | How It Arises |
|---------|---------------|
| **Double taxation** | Both states tax the income; neither grants relief because each believes different article applies |
| **Double non-taxation** | Each state believes the other has primary taxing right under "its" applicable article |
| **Taxpayer uncertainty** | Cannot predict which state will tax, at what rate, or whether relief applies |
| **Competent authority disputes** | States disagree on proper treaty application |

---

## B. ARTICLE 3(2): THE RENVOI TO DOMESTIC LAW

### 1. The Text of Article 3(2)

Article 3(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides the default rule for interpreting undefined treaty terms:

> *"As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State."*

**Key elements:**
- Applies to terms **not defined** in the treaty
- Default: domestic law meaning of the **applying** state
- Exception: "unless the **context otherwise requires**"
- **Ambulatory** reference: meaning "at that time" (when applied, not when signed)
- Tax law meaning prevails over general law meaning

### 2. The Problem with Article 3(2)

Article 3(2) is often cited as the **primary cause** of qualification conflicts:

```
WHY ARTICLE 3(2) CREATES CONFLICTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE MECHANISM:

1. Treaty uses undefined term (e.g., "royalty", "interest", "dividend")
2. State A interprets term according to State A domestic law
3. State B interprets SAME term according to State B domestic law
4. If domestic laws differ → different interpretations
5. Different interpretations → different treaty articles apply
6. Different articles → QUALIFICATION CONFLICT

EXAMPLE: "Royalty" Definition

State A domestic law:                State B domestic law:
• Includes software                  • Excludes software
  licence payments                     licence payments
        │                                    │
        ▼                                    ▼
State A: "Payment is                 State B: "Payment is NOT
Article 12 royalty"                  royalty; it's Article 7
                                     business profits"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. The "Context Otherwise Requires" Exception

The critical qualifier in Article 3(2) is: **"unless the context otherwise requires"**.

This exception allows departure from domestic law meaning when:
- The treaty itself provides contextual indicators
- The OECD Commentary provides guidance
- The object and purpose of the treaty would be frustrated
- An autonomous meaning can be derived from treaty context

**The 2017 Update** added: "or the competent authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 25"—giving mutual agreement procedure (MAP) outcomes priority over domestic law.

---

## C. APPROACHES TO TREATY INTERPRETATION

### 1. Three Interpretive Approaches

International tax scholarship identifies three main approaches to interpreting undefined treaty terms:

| Approach | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Lex fori** (domestic law of applying state) | Each state applies its own domestic law meaning | Certainty within each jurisdiction | Causes qualification conflicts |
| **Lex causae** (domestic law of source state) | Both states adopt source state's characterisation | Consistency; source state controls | Allows source state to expand taxing rights |
| **Autonomous interpretation** | Derive meaning from treaty context, object, and purpose | Achieves common understanding | Difficult in practice; subjective |

### 2. The Vienna Convention Framework

Tax treaties, as international agreements, are subject to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) interpretation rules:

**Article 31 VCLT - General Rule:**
- Interpret in good faith
- Ordinary meaning of terms
- In their context
- In light of object and purpose

**Article 32 VCLT - Supplementary Means:**
- Preparatory work (travaux préparatoires)
- Circumstances of conclusion
- Only when Article 31 leaves meaning ambiguous or obscure

**Relationship with Article 3(2):**

The relationship between Article 3(2) OECD MTC and VCLT Articles 31-32 is disputed:
- Some argue VCLT takes precedence; Article 3(2) is part of "context"
- Others argue Article 3(2) is a special rule (*lex specialis*) for tax treaties
- The better view: Article 3(2) operates **within** the VCLT framework, not outside it

```
EXAM TIP: VCLT and Article 3(2) Relationship
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

June 2023 Q3 discussed Article 3(2) in context of treaty override.

KEY POINT from suggested solution:
"Article 3(2) is considered by some to be a vivid treaty-based
reminder of the connection between the DTC and the two contracting
states' domestic legal systems, which allows the DTC to link into
the relevant CS's taxing rights that are established in its
domestic legislation."

The AMBULATORY nature means domestic law at TIME OF APPLICATION
governs—not at time treaty was signed. This is significant for
subsequent domestic law changes.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. The Role of the OECD Commentary

The OECD Commentary provides interpretive guidance but its legal status is debated:

| Status | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| **Context** under Article 31(2) VCLT | Agreement made between parties in connection with treaty |
| **Subsequent agreement** under Article 31(3)(a) | When Commentary changes reflect state consensus |
| **Supplementary means** under Article 32 | Travaux préparatoires equivalent |
| **No binding status** | Not ratified; soft law only |

**Practical reality**: Courts give significant weight to the Commentary, particularly for treaties based on the OECD Model.

## D. TYPES OF QUALIFICATION CONFLICTS

### 1. Entity Qualification Conflicts

**Source**: Different characterisation of entities as transparent or opaque (Chapter 6.2)

**Example**: Partnership treatment
- State A: Partnership is transparent → partners are taxpayers
- State B: Partnership is opaque → partnership is taxpayer

**Treaty consequence**: Different "persons" entitled to treaty benefits; different articles may apply (partnership income vs member income)

**OECD Solution**: Article 1(2) OECD MTC 2017 addresses fiscally transparent entities—income "shall be considered to be income of a resident" to extent treated as such by that state.

### 2. Income Qualification Conflicts

**Source**: Different characterisation of the **nature** of income

**Classic examples:**

| Payment Type | State A View | State B View | Conflict |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Software licence** | Royalty (Art. 12) | Business profits (Art. 7) | Which article applies? |
| **Lease payments** | Royalty (Art. 12) | Immovable property (Art. 6) | Source vs residence taxation |
| **Technical services fee** | Royalty (Art. 12) | Services (Art. 14/7) | Withholding tax application |
| **Convertible bond** | Interest (Art. 11) | Dividend (Art. 10) | Different withholding rates |

### 3. Fact Qualification Conflicts

**Source**: Different factual assessments of the **same** transaction

**Example**: PE determination
- State A: Activities constitute "preparatory or auxiliary" (no PE)
- State B: Activities constitute "core business" (PE exists)

**Consequence**: Different treatment under Article 7; potential double taxation or non-taxation.

---

## E. OECD SOLUTIONS TO QUALIFICATION CONFLICTS

### 1. The Partnership Report (1999)

The OECD Partnership Report (1999) addressed qualification conflicts arising from entity characterisation:

**Key recommendation**: The residence state should "follow" the source state's characterisation and provide relief accordingly.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents source state from manipulating characterisation to deny treaty benefits
- Provides certainty—source state's view determines treaty application
- Residence state grants relief based on source state's actual taxation

### 2. Commentary Update (2000)

The OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs adopted the Partnership Report approach in the Commentary Update 2000:

> *"The State of residence should, as a general rule and subject to certain conditions, accept the source State's qualification of an item of income and provide relief accordingly."*

**Conditions for residence state to accept source state qualification:**
- Source state has applied its domestic law correctly
- Source state's characterisation is not unreasonable
- The taxpayer has been subject to tax in the source state

### 3. Limitations of the OECD Approach

| Issue | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Not binding** | Commentary is soft law; states may deviate |
| **Circular problem** | What if source state's characterisation is wrong? |
| **Domestic law overrides** | Some states' domestic law may not permit following foreign characterisation |
| **Taxpayer disadvantage** | Source state characterisation may be less favourable |

---

## F. EXAM APPLICATION: QUALIFICATION IN DISTRIBUTIVE RULES

### 1. Priority Rules Between Distributive Articles

The December 2022 exam (Q4) tested understanding of how distributive rules interact:

```
EXAM FOCUS: December 2022 Q4 - Article 13 and Distributive Rules
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUESTION STRUCTURE:
Part 1 (13 marks): Domestic tax law applying a DTC
Part 2 (12 marks): Interaction between Article 13 and other
                   distributive rules

KEY POINTS:

1. ARTICLE 13 (Capital Gains) interaction issues:
   • Article 13(1): Immovable property gains → source state taxes
   • Article 13(2): PE business property gains → may be taxed
   • Article 13(5): Other gains → residence state only

2. OVERLAP SCENARIOS:
   • Shares deriving value from immovable property
   • Gains from disposal of PE
   • When does Article 13 apply vs other articles?

3. DOMESTIC LAW APPLICATION:
   • Article 3(2) renvoi to domestic definitions
   • "Capital gains" may be defined differently
   • Timing of gain recognition may differ
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Explicit vs Implicit Priority Rules

The OECD Model contains both explicit and implicit priority rules:

**Explicit priority rules:**

| Rule | Location | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| Article 7(4) | Business Profits | Other articles take precedence over Article 7 where applicable |
| Article 21(1) | Other Income | Only applies to income "not dealt with" in other articles |
| Article 10(4) | Dividends | PE rule overrides dividend article |

**Implicit priority rules:**
- Specific articles override general articles (*lex specialis*)
- Articles 6-20 take precedence over residual Article 21
- Domestic law determines initial characterisation; treaty then applies

### 3. Analytical Framework for Exam Questions

```
STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS: QUALIFICATION ISSUES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE INCOME/TRANSACTION
   • What is the nature of the payment/gain?
   • What are the relevant facts?

STEP 2: DETERMINE EACH STATE'S CHARACTERISATION
   • How does State A (residence) characterise under domestic law?
   • How does State B (source) characterise under domestic law?
   • Is there a conflict?

STEP 3: IDENTIFY APPLICABLE TREATY ARTICLES
   • Which distributive rule(s) could apply?
   • Are there priority rules between articles?
   • Does Article 3(2) apply to undefined terms?

STEP 4: CONSIDER "CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES"
   • Does the treaty context suggest different interpretation?
   • What does the OECD Commentary say?
   • Is autonomous interpretation appropriate?

STEP 5: APPLY OECD SOLUTION (if relevant)
   • Should residence state follow source state characterisation?
   • What relief should residence state provide?

STEP 6: IDENTIFY OUTCOME
   • Which state has taxing rights?
   • Is there double taxation or non-taxation?
   • Is competent authority resolution needed?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## G. CONNECTION TO TREATY OVERRIDE

### 1. Ambulatory Interpretation and Treaty Override

The June 2023 exam (Q3) explored Article 3(2) in the context of treaty override:

**The issue**: Because Article 3(2) uses an **ambulatory** reference (meaning "at that time" of application), a state can change its domestic law **after** the treaty is signed, thereby changing the meaning of treaty terms.

**Is this treaty override?**

The suggested solution noted two views:
1. **Not override**: Article 3(2) "bakes in" the possibility of domestic law changes—they are anticipated by the treaty structure
2. **Potential override**: If domestic law changes go "beyond the context" of the treaty, they may constitute override

**The qualifier**: "unless the context otherwise requires" limits the extent to which domestic law changes can alter treaty meaning.

### 2. CFC Rules and Qualification

A specific example discussed in examinations is whether CFC rules constitute treaty override:

**OECD position** (Commentary on Article 1, [81]):
- CFC rules are **not** contrary to the OECD MTC
- They involve the residence state taxing its own residents
- When read "in context," CFC rules do not conflict with the treaty

**Relevance to qualification**: CFC rules often involve re-characterising income (e.g., passive income of CFC attributed to shareholder). This is a form of qualification issue—whether the attributed income retains its character or becomes "other income."

---

## H. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### 1. Software Payments

One of the most common qualification conflicts involves software payments:

| Classification | State View | Treaty Article | Tax Consequence |
|----------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Royalty** | Payment for use of copyright | Article 12 | Source may tax (limited rate) |
| **Business profit** | Purchase of product/service | Article 7 | Source taxes only if PE |
| **Services** | Payment for technical services | Article 14 (if exists) | Fixed base required for source tax |

**OECD Commentary guidance** (Article 12, paragraph 14-17): Distinguishes between payments for:
- Copyright in software (royalty)
- Copyrighted article (not royalty—product sale)
- Know-how (royalty if use of confidential information)

### 2. Cross-Border Leasing

| Lease Type | Possible Classifications | Conflict Potential |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Equipment lease | Royalty (Art. 12) vs Business profits (Art. 7) | High |
| Property lease | Immovable property (Art. 6) vs Other income (Art. 21) | Medium |
| Finance lease | Interest (Art. 11) vs Royalty (Art. 12) | Medium |

### 3. Hybrid Instruments

As discussed in Chapter 6.2, hybrid instruments create qualification conflicts:

| Instrument Feature | State A View | State B View |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Convertible bond | Interest (debt) | Dividend (equity) |
| Profit-participating loan | Interest | Dividend |
| Perpetual debt | Debt (interest) | Equity (dividend) |

---

## Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Ignoring "context otherwise requires" | Critical exception to domestic law reference | Always consider whether context displaces domestic law |
| Conflating VCLT with Article 3(2) | Different frameworks with complex relationship | Explain how they interact; VCLT provides broader context |
| Assuming Commentary is binding | Soft law only; persuasive not binding | Note Commentary's status while acknowledging its influence |
| Missing the ambulatory nature | Key feature of Article 3(2) | Emphasise "at that time" means time of application |
| Not linking to entity characterisation | Chapter 6.2 concepts feed into qualification | Show how transparent/opaque creates qualification issues |
| Forgetting priority rules | Articles have explicit and implicit hierarchy | Identify which article takes precedence |
