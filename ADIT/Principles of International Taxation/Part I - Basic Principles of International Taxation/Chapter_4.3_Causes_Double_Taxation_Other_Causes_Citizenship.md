## Chapter 4.3: Other Causes of International Double Taxation

### 1. Beyond Residence and Source Conflicts

While residence-source and residence-residence conflicts represent the primary causes of international double taxation, several additional factors can create or exacerbate multiple taxation situations. These include citizenship-based taxation, economic double taxation, transfer pricing adjustments, triangular cases involving three or more countries, and hybrid mismatch arrangements. Understanding these additional causes provides a complete picture of how double taxation arises in international transactions.

### 2. Citizenship-Based Taxation

#### 2.1. The United States Exception

The United States is virtually alone among developed nations in taxing based on citizenship rather than solely on residence. While nearly all other countries determine tax liability by reference to residence—ending worldwide taxation when a person ceases to be resident—the United States taxes its citizens on worldwide income regardless of where they live.

This approach creates unique double taxation problems for US citizens residing abroad. A US citizen living in Germany, for example, may face taxation from three sources: Germany taxes worldwide income based on residence; any source state taxes income arising within its territory; and the United States taxes worldwide income based on citizenship. The Germany-source state treaty may resolve the residence-source conflict, but the US tax claim exists regardless of and in addition to any treaty between Germany and the source state. *(covered in June 2023)*

Eritrea imposes a 2% diaspora tax on citizens abroad, but no other major economy follows the US approach of full worldwide taxation based on citizenship.

#### 2.2. The Saving Clause

US tax treaties contain a "saving clause" that preserves the US right to tax its citizens as if no treaty existed. Article 1 of the US Model Tax Convention typically provides that the Convention shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its citizens. This means that treaties between the United States and other countries do not prevent the US from taxing its citizens—they only provide limited relief mechanisms.

US law offers partial mitigation through the foreign earned income exclusion (allowing US citizens abroad to exclude a portion of foreign earned income from US tax) and foreign tax credits (providing dollar-for-dollar credit for foreign taxes paid, subject to limitations). However, these mechanisms reduce rather than eliminate the citizenship-based tax burden, leaving many US citizens abroad subject to overlapping taxation that treaties cannot fully resolve.

### 3. Economic Double Taxation

Economic double taxation occurs when the same income is taxed in the hands of different taxpayers, distinguished from juridical double taxation where the same taxpayer is taxed twice on the same income. The OECD Commentary explicitly notes that Articles 23A and 23B address juridical double taxation, "which is to be distinguished from so-called economic double taxation."

The classic example involves corporate profits and dividends. A company earns profits and pays corporate income tax. When those after-tax profits are distributed as dividends, the shareholder pays personal income tax on the dividend received. The same economic income—the company's profits—is thus taxed twice: first at the corporate level and again at the shareholder level. While both taxes are legally distinct (imposed on different taxpayers), the economic burden falls ultimately on the same pool of income. *(covered in December 2022)*

Unlike juridical double taxation, economic double taxation is primarily addressed through domestic law rather than treaties. Common mechanisms include participation exemptions (exempting dividends received from qualifying subsidiaries), imputation systems (providing shareholders with credits for company tax paid), and reduced dividend tax rates. The EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive addresses economic double taxation within the European Union by exempting qualifying intercompany dividends from withholding tax.

### 4. Other Causes

#### 4.1. Transfer Pricing Conflicts

When related parties engage in cross-border transactions, each state may apply its own transfer pricing rules to determine the arm's length price. If states reach different conclusions about the appropriate price, conflicting adjustments may result in the same income being taxed in both jurisdictions.

Article 9(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention addresses this by requiring corresponding adjustments: when one state increases a taxpayer's profits under the arm's length principle, the other state should make an appropriate adjustment to relieve the resulting double taxation. However, states may disagree on whether the initial adjustment was appropriate, and resolution often requires the Mutual Agreement Procedure, which can take considerable time.

#### 4.2. Triangular Cases

Triangular cases involve three or more countries where bilateral treaties fail to provide complete relief because they only address two-party situations. The typical structure involves a parent company resident in State A, a permanent establishment in State B, and income sourced from State C flowing to the permanent establishment.

Each pair of states has a bilateral treaty—A-B, B-C, and A-C—but no treaty addresses all three together. State C may withhold tax on the income; State B may tax the permanent establishment on income received; and State A may tax the parent on worldwide income. The overlapping claims may not be fully resolved by any single bilateral treaty, potentially leaving residual double or triple taxation.

#### 4.3. Hybrid Mismatches

Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when two states classify the same entity, instrument, or transaction differently, leading to mismatched tax treatment. A payment may be deductible in one state but not included in income in the other (deduction/no inclusion), or the same expense may be deducted in both states (double deduction).

While hybrid mismatches more commonly produce double non-taxation than double taxation, classification differences can also result in the same income being taxed in both jurisdictions under different characterisations. BEPS Action 2 addresses hybrid mismatch arrangements through recommendations for linking rules that deny deductions or require income inclusion to neutralise mismatched outcomes.

These additional causes of double taxation demonstrate that the international tax framework must address complexities beyond simple residence-source allocation, requiring coordination of domestic laws, treaty provisions, and multilateral initiatives to achieve comprehensive relief.
