## Chapter 3.2: State Practice in Determining Residence of Individuals and Corporations

### 1. The Domestic Law Primacy Principle

Tax residence is fundamentally a matter of domestic law. There is no universal international definition of residence; each jurisdiction applies its own criteria to determine who qualifies as a resident taxpayer. This principle is reflected in Article 4(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which defines a "resident of a Contracting State" as any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of domicile, residence, place of management, or any other criterion of a similar nature.

The domestic law primacy principle creates the potential for conflicting outcomes. A person may be resident in one country under its domestic law while being non-resident in another, or—more problematically—may be treated as resident in both countries simultaneously. Dual residence triggers potential double taxation, which treaties then seek to resolve through tie-breaker provisions.

#### 1.1. Categories of Residence Tests

States generally employ one or more of the following approaches to determine residence. Physical presence tests focus on the number of days spent within the jurisdiction, with 183 days being the most common threshold. Permanent home tests examine whether the individual maintains available accommodation. Centre of vital interests analysis considers the totality of personal and economic ties. Domicile-based tests, still used in some jurisdictions, look to the individual's permanent home and intention to remain. For corporations, the primary tests are place of incorporation and place of effective management.

The choice of test reflects policy priorities. Bright-line rules such as day-counting provide certainty but are susceptible to manipulation through careful planning. Subjective tests based on ties and connections are harder to avoid but create administrative complexity and potential disputes.

### 2. Individual Residence: State Practice

#### 2.1. Physical Presence Tests

The most widespread approach uses physical presence as the primary determinant of residence. The 183-day rule—treating anyone present for more than half the year as resident—appears in numerous domestic tax codes. However, the precise application varies significantly across jurisdictions.

Most countries count a day of presence when the individual is present at midnight, though some count arrival and departure days separately. The United States employs a more sophisticated approach through its Substantial Presence Test, which applies a weighted three-year formula: days in the current year count fully, days in the prior year count at one-third, and days in the second prior year count at one-sixth. An individual meeting the 183-day threshold under this formula, with at least 31 days in the current year, is treated as a US tax resident unless an exception applies.

Exceptions to presence-based residence include closer connection tests (for individuals maintaining stronger ties elsewhere), treaty tie-breakers, and exemptions for specific categories such as students and diplomats.

#### 2.2. The UK Statutory Residence Test

The United Kingdom introduced the Statutory Residence Test in 2013, replacing the previous case law-based approach that had become difficult to apply in an era of increased international mobility. The SRT represents the most sophisticated domestic residence test currently in operation, using a three-tier structure that combines objective criteria with subjective assessments. *(covered in June 2022)*

The first tier comprises automatic overseas tests. An individual meeting any of these tests is automatically non-resident regardless of other factors. The tests cover scenarios including: resident in one or more of the previous three years but present fewer than 16 days; not resident in any of the previous three years and present fewer than 46 days; and working full-time overseas with limited UK presence and work days.

The second tier provides automatic UK tests establishing residence. These include presence for 183 or more days, having a home in the UK for more than 90 days with no overseas home (or limited presence at any overseas home), and working sufficient hours in the UK with more than 75% of working days in the country.

Where neither automatic test applies, the third tier—the sufficient ties test—determines residence through a combination of days present and connections to the UK. The five ties considered are: family (spouse or minor children resident in UK); accommodation (available for at least 91 days, used at least one night); work (40 or more UK working days); 90-day tie (more than 90 days in UK in either of prior two years); and country tie (for leavers only, where UK is the country of greatest presence). The number of ties required for residence decreases as days of presence increase, ranging from four ties for 16-45 days down to one tie for 121-182 days.

#### 2.3. Other State Practice

France determines residence through a combination of tests, treating an individual as resident if any of the following applies: their primary home (foyer) is in France; their principal place of abode is in France; they exercise a non-ancillary professional activity in France; or France is the centre of their economic interests.

Germany applies a simpler approach based on maintaining a dwelling (*Wohnung*) in Germany or having a habitual abode through more than six months of continuous presence. The dwelling need not be owned; any accommodation available for use suffices. Australia uses a combination approach examining ordinary residence under the common law meaning, domicile (unless a permanent place of abode is established outside Australia), and the 183-day presence test. An individual satisfying any of these tests becomes an Australian resident for tax purposes.

These variations in domestic law create the potential for simultaneous residence in multiple jurisdictions—a problem that tax treaties seek to resolve but cannot eliminate at the domestic law level.

### 3. Corporate Residence: State Practice

#### 3.1. Place of Incorporation Test

Under the incorporation test, a company is resident in the jurisdiction where it is legally formed and registered. This provides maximum certainty—the certificate of incorporation definitively establishes residence. The United States uses incorporation as its primary test, and the UK applies it alongside the management test for companies incorporated in the UK.

The simplicity of this test is also its weakness. Companies can easily incorporate in jurisdictions with favourable tax regimes while conducting all substantive activities elsewhere. This form-over-substance approach facilitated the creation of "letterbox companies" with no genuine presence in their country of incorporation, prompting many jurisdictions to adopt management-based tests either as alternatives or supplements.

#### 3.2. Place of Effective Management

The place of effective management test determines corporate residence based on where key management and commercial decisions are made in substance. This approach focuses on the reality of how a company operates rather than its formal legal registration.

The foundational authority is *De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd v Howe* [1906] AC 455, where the House of Lords held that a company incorporated in South Africa was resident in London because its board of directors met and made all key decisions there. Lord Loreburn LC stated that "a company resides for purposes of income tax where its real business is carried on... and the real business is carried on where the central management and control actually abides." The case established that residence follows substance over form, looking to where decisions are actually made rather than where the company is registered. *(covered in December 2022)*

Subsequent cases refined this principle. *Unit Construction Co Ltd v Bullock* [1959] examined where vital business decisions were made, emphasising highest-level control over operational decisions. *Wood v Holden* [2006] confirmed that board meeting location is significant but not determinative. *Laerstate BV v HMRC* [2009] emphasised actual management activities over formal control.

The OECD Commentary provides guidance on determining POEM, directing examination of where the board meets, where senior management makes decisions, where day-to-day management occurs, where business records are kept, and where strategic decisions are formulated. The fundamental principle is that there can be only one POEM at any given time.

#### 3.3. The Seat Test

Continental European jurisdictions commonly apply the seat test, which examines where the company's head office or registered office is located. Unlike the central management and control test, which focuses on where decisions are actually made, the seat test considers where day-to-day management and operational control are exercised. France and Germany both use seat-based criteria, which may produce different results from the UK's central management and control approach when a company's formal seat differs from where its highest-level decisions are taken.

### 4. Treaty Tie-Breaker Rules

#### 4.1. Individual Tie-Breakers

When an individual is resident in both contracting states under their respective domestic laws, Article 4(2) of the OECD Model provides a sequential hierarchy to determine treaty residence. The tests are applied in order until one resolves the issue.

The first test examines permanent home. If the individual has a permanent home available in only one state, they are resident there. If homes exist in both states, residence is determined by the centre of vital interests—the state with which personal and economic relations are closer. Relevant factors include family location, social connections, employment, business activities, investments, and administrative ties.

If the centre of vital interests cannot be determined or no permanent home exists in either state, the second test considers habitual abode—where the individual stays more regularly over time. Failing this, the third test looks to nationality. If none of these tests resolves the matter, or if the individual is a national of both or neither state, the competent authorities must settle the question by mutual agreement. *(covered in December 2023)*

#### 4.2. Corporate Tie-Breakers

For entities other than individuals, the 2017 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention fundamentally changed the tie-breaker approach. Previously, Article 4(3) specified that dual-resident entities would be treated as resident only in the state where their place of effective management was situated.

The revised Article 4(3) replaced this automatic rule with a case-by-case determination through the Mutual Agreement Procedure. The competent authorities must endeavour to determine residence by mutual agreement, having regard to the place of effective management, place of incorporation, and any other relevant factors.

#### 4.3. Implications of the 2017 Changes

The shift to MAP for corporate residence reflects recognition that POEM alone may be inadequate for determining residence in an era of virtual meetings, distributed management teams, and algorithmic decision-making. The change also addresses concerns about POEM manipulation through carefully staged board meetings.

However, the MAP approach introduces uncertainty. If the competent authorities cannot reach agreement, the entity is not entitled to any treaty relief or exemption except to the extent specifically agreed between the authorities. This creates significant practical consequences for companies facing genuine dual residence situations, as their treaty entitlement becomes contingent on administrative resolution rather than application of objective criteria.

The Multilateral Instrument implements this change for countries that have opted in, though empirical analysis indicates that place of effective management remains predominant in actual treaty practice, with MAP adoption increasing only marginally following MLI implementation. For practitioners, this means that the traditional POEM analysis remains relevant both for domestic law purposes and for understanding how competent authorities are likely to approach residence determinations under the new regime.
