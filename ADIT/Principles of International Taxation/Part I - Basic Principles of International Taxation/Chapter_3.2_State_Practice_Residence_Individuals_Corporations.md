## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION

### 1. The Domestic Law Primacy Principle

**Key Principle**: Tax residence is determined under **domestic law** of each jurisdiction. There is no universal international definition of residence.

**Article 4(1) OECD MTC** states:
> "The term 'resident of a Contracting State' means any person who, under the **laws of that State**, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature."

**Critical Implication**: A person may be:
- Resident in one country under its domestic law
- Non-resident in another country under its domestic law
- **Dual resident** if both countries' domestic laws treat them as resident

**Why This Creates Problems**:
- Different countries use different tests (physical presence, domicile, incorporation, management)
- Tests may produce conflicting results
- Dual residence leads to double taxation unless resolved by treaty

### 2. Types of Residence Tests

States generally use one or more of the following approaches:

| Test Category | Basis | Example Countries |
|--------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Physical presence** | Days spent in country | USA (183-day), Australia, many others |
| **Permanent home** | Available accommodation | UK (SRT), Germany |
| **Centre of vital interests** | Personal/economic ties | France, Switzerland |
| **Domicile** | Permanent home + intention | UK (for certain purposes) |
| **Incorporation** | Place of legal formation | USA, UK, Ireland |
| **Place of management** | Where decisions made | Germany, India, many civil law countries |

---

## B. INDIVIDUAL RESIDENCE: STATE PRACTICE

### 1. Physical Presence Tests

The most common approach uses **number of days** present in the country.

#### The 183-Day Rule

Many countries use 183 days (half a year) as a threshold:

| Jurisdiction | 183-Day Rule Details |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Most countries** | Present ≥183 days in tax year = resident |
| **OECD MTC Art. 15** | 183-day threshold for employment income taxation |
| **USA (SPT)** | Modified: weighted average over 3 years |
| **UK** | 183 days = automatic UK residence under SRT |

**How Days Are Counted**:
- Generally: Present at **midnight** = 1 day counted
- Some countries count arrival/departure days
- "Exceptional circumstances" days may be excluded (UK: up to 60 days)

#### US Substantial Presence Test (SPT)

The US uses a sophisticated **3-year weighted formula**:

```
SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE TEST CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Formula:
  Current year days × 1.0
+ Prior year days × 1/3
+ Second prior year days × 1/6
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
≥ 183 days = Meets SPT (potentially US resident)

PLUS: Must have ≥31 days in current year

Example:
Year 2024: 120 days × 1.0 = 120
Year 2023: 120 days × 1/3 = 40
Year 2022: 120 days × 1/6 = 20
                    Total = 180 days

Result: Does NOT meet SPT (below 183)
```

**Exceptions to SPT**:
- Closer connection exception (tax home + closer ties elsewhere)
- Treaty tie-breaker (if dual resident under SPT + other country's test)
- Exempt individuals (F-1 students for 5 years, J-1 scholars for 2 years)

### 2. UK Statutory Residence Test (SRT)

The UK's SRT (introduced 2013) is the most sophisticated domestic residence test globally. It uses a **three-tier structure**:

#### Tier 1: Automatic Overseas Tests (Non-Residence)

Meet **any one** of these = automatically non-resident:

| Test | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **First automatic overseas** | UK resident in ≥1 of prior 3 years AND <16 days in UK in current year |
| **Second automatic overseas** | NOT UK resident in any of prior 3 years AND <46 days in UK in current year |
| **Third automatic overseas** | Work full-time overseas, <91 days in UK, <31 UK work days |

#### Tier 2: Automatic UK Tests (Residence)

If no automatic overseas test met, meet **any one** of these = automatically UK resident:

| Test | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **183-day test** | ≥183 days in UK |
| **UK home test** | Home in UK for >90 days + no overseas home (or present <30 days in overseas home) |
| **Full-time UK work** | Work sufficient hours in UK (average 35/week), >75% UK work days |

#### Tier 3: Sufficient Ties Test

If neither automatic test applies, residence depends on **combination of days + ties**:

**UK Ties** (5 possible):
1. **Family tie**: Spouse/civil partner or minor child resident in UK
2. **Accommodation tie**: UK accommodation available ≥91 days, used ≥1 night
3. **Work tie**: ≥40 UK work days in year
4. **90-day tie**: >90 days in UK in either of prior 2 years
5. **Country tie** (leavers only): Present in UK at midnight more days than any other country

**Days/Ties Matrix for Leavers** (resident in ≥1 of prior 3 years):

| Days in UK | Ties Needed for Residence |
|------------|---------------------------|
| <16 | Automatic non-resident |
| 16-45 | 4+ ties |
| 46-90 | 3+ ties |
| 91-120 | 2+ ties |
| 121-182 | 1+ ties |
| ≥183 | Automatic resident |

### 3. Other State Practice Examples

#### France

**Resident if ANY of**:
- Primary home (*foyer*) in France
- Principal place of abode in France
- Professional activity in France (unless ancillary)
- Centre of economic interests in France

#### Germany

**Resident if**:
- Dwelling (*Wohnung*) in Germany, OR
- Habitual abode in Germany (>6 months continuous presence)

#### Australia

Uses a **combination approach**:
- Resides in Australia (ordinary meaning)
- Domiciled in Australia (unless permanent place of abode outside)
- Present ≥183 days (unless usual place of abode outside)
- Commonwealth superannuation fund member

## C. CORPORATE RESIDENCE: STATE PRACTICE

### 1. The Two Primary Tests

Corporate residence is determined by one of two main tests:

| Test | Basis | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Incorporation** | Where legally formed | Simple, certain, objective | Easy to manipulate |
| **Place of Effective Management (POEM)** | Where key decisions made | Substance-based, harder to manipulate | Uncertain, subjective |

### 2. Place of Incorporation Test

**How It Works**: A company is resident where it is legally incorporated/registered.

**Countries Using This Test**:
- United States (primary test)
- United Kingdom (as one of two tests)
- Ireland, Netherlands (alongside management tests)

**Advantages**:
- Simple and certain
- Easy to determine
- Provides planning certainty

**Disadvantages**:
- Easily manipulated (incorporate in tax haven, manage elsewhere)
- Form over substance
- Facilitates stateless income structures

### 3. Place of Effective Management (POEM)

**Definition**: POEM is where key management and commercial decisions necessary for the conduct of business are **in substance made**.

**OECD Commentary Guidance on POEM**:

> "The place of effective management is the place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the entity's business as a whole are in substance made. All relevant facts and circumstances must be examined to determine the place of effective management."

**Factors to Consider**:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| **Board meetings** | Where are they held? Who attends? |
| **Senior management** | Where do they live and work? |
| **Day-to-day management** | Where are operational decisions made? |
| **Business records** | Where are books and records kept? |
| **Bank accounts** | Where are they operated from? |
| **Strategic decisions** | Where are major business decisions made? |

**Key Principle**: There can be **only one POEM** at any given time. The test looks for where decisions are made **in substance**, not just where formal meetings occur.

#### India's POEM Rules (Illustrative Example)

India introduced detailed POEM guidance in 2017:

**For companies with turnover ≤₹50 crore in any financial year** (active business outside India):
- POEM presumed to be outside India if majority of board meetings held outside India

**For other companies**, POEM determined by examining:
1. Where board decisions taken and board meetings held
2. Where senior management decisions taken
3. Where executive decisions taken
4. Where company's head office located
5. Where main and substantial activity carried out

### 4. Dual Corporate Residence Scenarios

**Problem**: A company incorporated in Country A may be managed from Country B, creating dual residence.

**Example**:
```
ALGERO CORPORATION (December 2022 Q6 Pattern)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Country A: Incorporation test
  → Algero incorporated in Country A = Resident

Country B: POEM test
  → Management team in Country B
  → Key decisions made in Country B
  → Board meetings sometimes in Country B
  = Potentially Resident

Result: Dual residence requiring treaty resolution
```

### 5. 2017 OECD MTC Changes for Corporate Residence

**Pre-2017**: Article 4(3) used POEM as the tie-breaker for dual-resident companies

**Post-2017**: Article 4(3) replaced POEM tie-breaker with **Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)**:

> "Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident..."

**Factors for MAP determination**:
- Place of effective management
- Place of incorporation
- Any other relevant factors

**Critical Point**: If no agreement reached, the company is **not entitled to treaty benefits** (except as agreed between competent authorities).

## D. TREATY TIE-BREAKER RULES (ARTICLE 4 OECD MTC)

### 1. Individual Tie-Breaker Rules (Article 4(2))

When an individual is resident in both states under domestic law, Article 4(2) provides a **sequential hierarchy**:

```
INDIVIDUAL TIE-BREAKER HIERARCHY (ARTICLE 4(2) OECD MTC)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: PERMANENT HOME TEST
  (a) Home in ONE state only → Resident of that state (STOP)
  (b) Home in BOTH states → Apply Centre of Vital Interests (sub-test)
      → CVI = state with closer personal AND economic relations
      → Consider: family, social ties, business, investments
      → If CVI resolves → Resident of that state (STOP)
      → If CVI cannot be determined → Go to Step 2
  (c) Home in NEITHER state → Go to Step 2

Step 2: HABITUAL ABODE
  → Resident of state where individual habitually lives
  → Based on frequency, duration, regularity of stays over time
  → If habitual abode in both/neither, go to Step 3

Step 3: NATIONALITY
  → Resident of state of which individual is national
  → If national of both/neither, go to Step 4

Step 4: MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE
  → Competent authorities must resolve by agreement
  → Individual not entitled to treaty benefits until resolved
```

### 2. Applying the Tie-Breaker: Worked Example

```
SCENARIO: Maria's Dual Residence
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Facts:
- Portuguese national
- Employed in UK, spends 200 days/year in UK
- House available in both UK and Portugal
- Spouse and children live in Portugal
- Bank accounts in both countries
- UK employer, Portuguese property investments

ANALYSIS:

Step 1: Permanent Home Test
→ Home available in UK (rented apartment) ✓
→ Home available in Portugal (family house) ✓
→ BOTH have permanent homes → Apply CVI sub-test

Step 1 (CVI sub-test): Centre of Vital Interests
Personal relations:
  → Spouse and children in Portugal (+Portugal)
  → Social life primarily in Portugal (+Portugal)
Economic relations:
  → Employment in UK (+UK)
  → Investments primarily in Portugal (+Portugal)
→ On balance, CLOSER TIES TO PORTUGAL
→ CVI resolves the issue → STOP (no need for Step 2)

RESULT: Maria is treated as resident ONLY of Portugal
for treaty purposes, despite spending more time in UK.
```

## E. THE EVOLUTION OF RESIDENCE TESTS AND POLICY DEBATES

### Historical Development

The concept of tax residence has evolved significantly over time:

**19th Century**: Simple domicile/presence tests sufficient for relatively immobile populations

**20th Century**: 183-day rules became standard as international travel increased

**21st Century**: Sophisticated multi-factor tests (like UK SRT) needed to address:
- Digital nomads and remote workers
- Frequent travellers
- International families
- Mobile entrepreneurs

### The Policy Tension: Certainty vs. Substance

Residence tests face an inherent trade-off:

| Approach | Certainty | Manipulation Risk | Example |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Bright-line rules** (183 days) | High | High | Day-counting to stay under threshold |
| **Subjective tests** (CVI) | Low | Low | Genuine ties harder to fake |
| **Hybrid** (UK SRT) | Medium | Medium | Complexity creates own manipulation opportunities |

The UK's 2013 shift to SRT reflects recognition that purely day-count rules were insufficient—but the complexity created new planning opportunities.

### Corporate Residence in the Digital Age

Traditional POEM concepts assume physical board meetings and identifiable management locations. Modern business reality challenges these assumptions:

**Virtual Board Meetings**: Directors participate from multiple jurisdictions simultaneously—where is the "place" of meeting?

**Distributed Management**: Senior executives work remotely across different countries—no single POEM location exists.

**Algorithmic Decision-Making**: Some business decisions made by automated systems located on servers in data centres—is that the POEM?

**Policy Responses**:
- 2017 OECD MTC moved to MAP for corporate tie-breakers (acknowledging POEM difficulties)
- Some countries considering "significant people functions" tests
- Pillar One effectively bypasses residence for largest MNEs

#### The Arbitrage Problem

Differences in domestic residence rules create arbitrage opportunities:

**Example**: "Nowhere" Residence
```
Country A: Residence based on presence (183+ days)
Country B: Residence based on domicile (intention to remain)

Individual Strategy:
- Spend 180 days in Country A (below threshold)
- Present in Country B but claim no intention to remain
- Potentially resident in neither country
```

**Example**: "Double" Residence
```
Country A: Resident based on home availability
Country B: Resident based on 90+ days presence

Individual could be resident in both simultaneously,
accessing treaty benefits of both countries with
third parties while potentially abusing CRS/FATCA
classifications.
```

These arbitrage opportunities explain why information exchange (CRS) requires residence self-certification and why treaty anti-abuse provisions have expanded.

## F. EXAM APPLICATION FRAMEWORK

### Recognition Triggers

| Trigger Phrase | Analysis Required |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "spent X days in Country Y" | Physical presence test |
| "home in both countries" | Permanent home + CVI analysis |
| "employed in X, family in Y" | CVI analysis |
| "incorporated in A, managed from B" | Corporate residence, POEM |
| "dual resident" | Article 4 tie-breaker |
| "board meets in various locations" | POEM uncertainty |

## G. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLE

### June 2022, Question 7 - Mykola Case (25 marks)

**Scenario Summary**:
- Mykola moves from Country U to Country X for work
- Initially 3-month assignment, extended to 18 months
- Country U: 8-month absence test (absent >8 months = non-resident)
- Country X: 183-day presence test (present >183 days = resident)
- Owns home in Country U, rents apartment in Country X
- Family remains in Country U initially

**Model Answer Structure**:

**Part 1: Country U Residence Status**

Under Country U domestic law, Mykola becomes non-resident if absent for more than 8 continuous months.

*Year 1*: Initially present for first part of year, then absent from [date]. If absence continues >8 months, non-resident from start of absence.

*Year 2*: If absence continues, remains non-resident.

However, continuing ownership of home in Country U may be relevant if Country U has secondary residence tests based on home availability.

**Part 2: Country X Residence Status**

Under Country X domestic law, Mykola becomes resident if present for more than 183 days in a tax year.

*Year 1*: If starts July, maximum 184 days (July-December) = potentially resident if present throughout.

*Year 2*: Full year present = clearly >183 days = resident.

**Part 3: Dual Residence Analysis**

If Mykola is resident in both countries (Country U not yet treating as non-resident while Country X treats as resident), Article 4(2) tie-breaker applies:

*Step 1: Permanent Home Test*
- Country U: Owned home remains available ✓
- Country X: Rented apartment available ✓
- Both have permanent homes → Apply CVI sub-test

*Step 1 (CVI sub-test): Centre of Vital Interests*
- Personal: Family in Country U (+U)
- Economic: Employment in Country X (+X)
- Need to weigh factors...

**Conclusion**: Result depends on how tribunal weighs personal vs. economic ties. If family location considered paramount, Country U residence. If employment location considered more significant, Country X residence.

## H. COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

| Error | Impact | Prevention |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Not stating domestic law determines residence | 3-4 marks | Always cite Article 4(1) first |
| Applying tie-breaker without dual residence | 4-5 marks | Check BOTH countries' domestic law first |
| Wrong order of tie-breaker steps | 3-4 marks | Permanent home (with CVI sub-test) → Habitual abode → Nationality → MAP |
| Confusing POEM with board meeting location | 3-4 marks | POEM = where decisions made in substance |
| Not addressing 2017 changes for companies | 2-3 marks | Note MAP replaced POEM for corporate tie-breaker |
| Forgetting treaty benefits denied if MAP fails | 2-3 marks | State consequence of no agreement |
