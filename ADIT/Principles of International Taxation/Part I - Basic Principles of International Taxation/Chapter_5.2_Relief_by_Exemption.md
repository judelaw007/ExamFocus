## Chapter 5.2: Relief by Exemption

### 1. The Exemption Method: Concept and Legal Foundation

#### 1.1. Article 23A OECD Model Tax Convention

The exemption method represents a fundamentally different approach to eliminating international double taxation compared to the credit method. While the credit method taxes worldwide income and provides relief through a deduction for foreign taxes paid, the exemption method removes foreign income entirely from the residence state's tax base. Article 23A of the OECD Model Tax Convention establishes the legal foundation for this approach, providing that where a resident of a Contracting State derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall exempt such income from tax.

The key distinction lies in the word "exempt"—the residence state relinquishes its taxing right over the income entirely, rather than taxing it and then providing relief. This produces a fundamentally different result than the credit method, as the effective tax rate on foreign income equals only the source state rate, with no residence state "top-up" regardless of rate differentials between the two jurisdictions. *(covered in December 2022)*

The exemption method may be applied either unilaterally through domestic legislation or bilaterally through tax treaty provisions. Many countries that use the credit method as their default relief mechanism nonetheless apply the exemption method to specific categories of income, most commonly business profits attributable to foreign permanent establishments and dividends from qualifying foreign subsidiaries.

#### 1.2. The Territorial Philosophy and Capital Import Neutrality

The exemption method embodies a territorial or source-based philosophy of taxation. Under this approach, the residence state accepts that income arising in foreign jurisdictions should be taxed exclusively by those jurisdictions, with no residual residence state claim. This contrasts with the worldwide taxation philosophy underlying the credit method, where the residence state asserts a continuing claim to tax its residents' global income regardless of where it arises.

This territorial philosophy produces Capital Import Neutrality, a principle holding that all investors competing in a particular market should face the same tax burden regardless of their country of residence. When the exemption method applies, a foreign investor and a domestic investor operating in the same source country face identical taxation—the source country rate only. Neither investor suffers competitive disadvantage from residence state taxation layered on top of source taxation.

Consider three companies operating in a source country with a 20% corporate tax rate: a domestic company, a company resident in an exemption-method country, and a company resident in a credit-method country with a 30% rate. The domestic and exemption-method companies both face 20% effective taxation on their source country profits. The credit-method company faces 30%—the source country's 20% plus a 10% residence state top-up—placing it at a competitive disadvantage against local and exemption-method competitors in that market.

Capital Import Neutrality stands in conceptual tension with Capital Export Neutrality, the principle underlying the credit method which holds that investment decisions should not be distorted by tax considerations—investors should face the same rate whether investing domestically or abroad. These two neutrality concepts cannot be achieved simultaneously unless all countries have identical tax rates. States must choose which neutrality to prioritise, and the exemption method reflects a choice in favour of competitive neutrality in foreign markets.

### 2. Types of Exemption

#### 2.1. Full Exemption and Its Limitations

Under full exemption, foreign income is entirely disregarded for all purposes—both for determining the tax base and for calculating the applicable tax rate. While conceptually straightforward, full exemption creates significant policy problems in systems with progressive tax rates.

The difficulty arises because progressive tax systems impose higher marginal rates as income increases. When foreign income is entirely excluded from rate calculations, the taxpayer's domestic income is taxed starting from the lowest bracket rather than the bracket appropriate to their total economic income. This produces a windfall benefit unrelated to territoriality principles.

Consider two individuals in a country with a 20% rate on the first €100,000 and 40% above that threshold. One earns €200,000 entirely from domestic sources; the other earns €100,000 domestic and €100,000 foreign. Under full exemption, the first pays €60,000 (€20,000 at 20% plus €100,000 at 40%), while the second pays only €20,000 (€100,000 at 20%), despite identical total income. This violates horizontal equity—the principle that taxpayers with equal ability to pay should bear equal tax burdens.

This "rate reset" effect explains why full exemption has become rare in modern tax systems. The policy justification for exemption is that source state taxation should be final, not that foreign income should provide domestic rate advantages.

#### 2.2. Exemption with Progression

Exemption with progression resolves the full exemption problem by excluding foreign income from the tax base while including it when calculating the applicable tax rate. Article 23A(3) of the OECD Model expressly authorises this approach, providing that where income is exempt from tax in the residence state, that state may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income, take into account the exempted income.

The mechanism operates by first calculating hypothetical tax on worldwide income to determine an average rate, then applying that rate to domestic income only. Using the earlier example, the taxpayer with €100,000 domestic and €100,000 foreign income would calculate tax on €200,000 total (€60,000), determine the average rate (30%), and apply that rate to domestic income only (€100,000 × 30% = €30,000).

This preserves the territorial principle—foreign income bears no residence state tax—while maintaining progressive rate structures and horizontal equity. The taxpayer still benefits from exemption (paying €30,000 rather than €60,000 if worldwide taxation applied), but does not receive the artificial rate advantage of full exemption.

Exemption with progression has become the standard form of exemption in modern tax systems. It represents a careful balance between territorial taxation principles and domestic tax policy objectives, ensuring that exemption relieves foreign income from double taxation without providing unintended domestic benefits.

### 3. Participation Exemption

#### 3.1. Concept and Policy Rationale

The participation exemption is a specific application of the exemption method to dividends received from qualifying foreign subsidiaries and, in many systems, to capital gains on the disposal of qualifying shareholdings. It addresses economic double taxation in corporate group structures—the risk that corporate profits will bear both corporate tax at the subsidiary level and additional tax when distributed as dividends to the parent.

Without participation exemption, profits flowing through a corporate group face cumulative taxation. A subsidiary earns €100 and pays €25 corporate tax; it distributes €75 as dividends; the parent pays €19 tax on the dividend (at 25%); net retained earnings are €56. The effective combined rate on the original €100 profit exceeds 44%, substantially higher than either jurisdiction's statutory rate.

The participation exemption eliminates this cascading effect by exempting qualifying dividends from parent company taxation. The subsidiary pays its €25 tax, distributes €75, and the parent retains €75 with no additional tax burden. The single-level corporate tax rate applies, allowing profits to flow through group structures without escalating effective rates. *(covered in June 2023)*

This treatment reflects recognition that subsidiary profits and parent dividends represent economically identical income. Taxing both constitutes economic double taxation even though different legal persons are involved. The participation exemption is thus not properly understood as a subsidy or preference—it is a mechanism for achieving single taxation of corporate profits within group structures.

#### 3.2. Qualifying Conditions

States impose conditions on participation exemption eligibility to ensure benefits reach genuine business operations rather than artificial arrangements designed to exploit the exemption. These conditions reflect anti-avoidance concerns and typically address ownership thresholds, holding periods, activity requirements, and taxation levels.

Minimum shareholding thresholds ensure the exemption applies to substantial investments representing genuine economic stakes rather than portfolio holdings. Common thresholds range from 5% to 25%, with lower thresholds favouring flexibility and higher thresholds ensuring only significant participations qualify. The EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive applies a 10% threshold for intra-EU dividend exemption.

Holding period requirements prevent dividend stripping—the acquisition of shares shortly before dividend distribution specifically to access exemption benefits. Typical requirements range from twelve months to two years of continuous holding. Some jurisdictions apply the requirement prospectively (shares must be held for the required period after acquisition), while others permit retroactive compliance if shares are ultimately held long enough.

Active business tests distinguish operating subsidiaries engaged in genuine economic activities from passive holding structures. Requirements may specify that the subsidiary conduct substantial business operations, maintain adequate employees and premises, or derive its income predominantly from active business rather than passive investment returns.

Subject-to-tax conditions address concerns that participation exemption combined with low or zero source-state taxation produces double non-taxation. These conditions require that the subsidiary be subject to genuine profit taxation at a minimum effective rate—commonly around 10%—before the parent qualifies for exemption. Where the subsidiary is located in a low-tax or no-tax jurisdiction, the exemption may be denied entirely or replaced with the credit method.

#### 3.3. State Practice: Netherlands, Germany, and the United States

The Netherlands operates one of the most developed participation exemption regimes globally, reflecting its traditional role as a holding company jurisdiction. Dutch companies holding at least 5% of a subsidiary's nominal paid-up capital may qualify for full exemption on dividends and capital gains. The exemption requires satisfaction of one of three tests: the subsidiary must be subject to genuine profit taxation at an effective rate of at least 10%; or the parent must have qualifying involvement in the subsidiary's management and strategy; or the subsidiary's assets must consist predominantly of active business assets rather than passive investments. Recent clarifications confirm that the exemption applies to the full capital gain on disposal even where transfer pricing adjustments have affected the tax basis.

Germany applies a 95% participation exemption, with 5% of dividends deemed non-deductible business expenses and therefore effectively taxed. This approach provides substantial relief while maintaining a modest revenue stream and creating a disincentive for purely tax-motivated structures. The German system includes switch-over provisions allowing tax authorities to apply the credit method instead of exemption where the subsidiary is subject to low taxation, providing a built-in anti-abuse mechanism. For capital gains, similar principles apply with a 10% minimum shareholding threshold.

The United States underwent fundamental transformation in 2017 with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, shifting from a worldwide credit system to a quasi-territorial approach. The new regime provides a 100% dividends-received deduction for qualifying dividends from foreign subsidiaries in which the US parent holds at least 10%. This represents a dramatic departure from the prior system, which taxed worldwide income with deferral until repatriation. The shift was accompanied by anti-abuse provisions including the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime, which imposes current US taxation on certain low-taxed foreign income regardless of distribution. This combination of participation exemption with targeted anti-abuse rules reflects the modern approach to territorial taxation. *(covered in December 2024)*

### 4. Anti-Abuse Measures and Double Non-Taxation

#### 4.1. The Double Non-Taxation Problem

A significant concern with the exemption method is double non-taxation—situations where income escapes taxation in both residence and source states. This occurs when the residence state exempts income that the source state does not actually tax, whether due to domestic incentives, classification differences, or structural mismatches.

Classification mismatches illustrate this problem clearly. The residence state may classify a payment as business profits and exempt it under Article 7 on the assumption the source state will exercise its permanent establishment-based taxing right. The source state may classify the same payment as royalties and find it has no taxing right because no permanent establishment exists and its treaty with the residence state eliminates source taxation of royalties. Neither state taxes the income.

Similar outcomes arise where source states offer tax holidays or investment incentives. The residence state exempts income assuming it will be taxed at source; the source state exempts or reduces taxation to attract investment; the income escapes meaningful taxation entirely. While the source state intended to incentivise investment, the combined effect with residence state exemption may exceed what either state intended.

Hybrid instrument mismatches produce comparable results. An instrument treated as equity in the residence state generates exempt dividends for the parent; the same instrument treated as debt in the source state produces deductible interest for the subsidiary. The payment reduces taxable income at source and is excluded from income at residence—a deduction with no corresponding inclusion.

#### 4.2. Subject-to-Tax Clauses

Subject-to-tax clauses address double non-taxation by conditioning residence state exemption on actual taxation at source. The exemption applies only if the income is subject to tax in the source state at or above a specified minimum rate. If the source state fails to exercise its taxing right, the residence state is not obliged to relinquish its own.

The mechanism operates as a conditional exemption: the residence state commits to exempt only income that faces genuine source taxation. This preserves the basic exemption structure while preventing exploitation where source taxation is absent. The clause may specify a minimum effective rate, typically between 10% and 15%, below which the condition is not satisfied.

Subject-to-tax clauses gained prominence following the BEPS project's focus on preventing double non-taxation. The OECD Commentary now explicitly contemplates their inclusion in bilateral treaties, and many recent treaties incorporate such provisions. The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive similarly requires member states to address situations where exemption would otherwise result in double non-taxation.

#### 4.3. Switch-Over Clauses

Switch-over clauses provide a more flexible anti-abuse mechanism by allowing the residence state to abandon the exemption method and apply the credit method when abuse indicators are present. Rather than denying relief entirely, the switch-over preserves relief while ensuring residence state taxation applies.

Typical switch-over triggers include source state exemption of the income, source state taxation below a specified threshold, or classification mismatches that would produce double non-taxation. When triggered, the residence state includes the income in its tax base and provides credit for any foreign tax actually paid. The income faces at least residence state taxation rather than escaping both jurisdictions.

Germany's treaties frequently include switch-over provisions, reflecting policy concerns about low-tax foreign income. The German domestic law regime similarly provides for switch-over where foreign income is subject to preferential regimes or effectively exempt at source. This approach maintains the exemption method as the default while providing targeted protection against its exploitation.

### 5. Current Developments

#### 5.1. Pillar Two and the Subject to Tax Rule

The OECD/G20 Pillar Two framework introduces significant new constraints on exemption method outcomes. The global minimum tax of 15% on multinational enterprise profits fundamentally challenges the exemption method's traditional logic—that source state taxation should be final regardless of its rate.

The Income Inclusion Rule requires parent companies to pay top-up tax on subsidiary income where the subsidiary's effective tax rate falls below 15%. This applies regardless of whether the parent's jurisdiction uses exemption or credit methods. A parent that would normally exempt subsidiary dividends must nevertheless ensure the underlying income has faced at least 15% taxation, either at source or through top-up.

The Subject to Tax Rule operates differently, addressing specific categories of intra-group payments rather than subsidiary profits generally. This treaty-based rule permits source countries to impose additional withholding taxation on interest, royalties, and service fees paid to related parties where those payments are subject to nominal taxation below 9% in the recipient's jurisdiction. The STTR thus provides a source-country backstop against base-eroding payments to low-tax affiliates.

A dedicated multilateral convention facilitates STTR implementation. Signed by multiple jurisdictions in 2024, it amends covered tax treaties to incorporate the rule without requiring bilateral renegotiation. The STTR particularly benefits developing countries that rely heavily on withholding taxes and faced erosion of their tax base through deductible payments to low-tax affiliates.

#### 5.2. The Global Trend Toward Territorial Taxation

Despite Pillar Two's constraints, the broader trend over recent decades has been toward territorial taxation and the exemption method. The United States' 2017 shift from worldwide credit to quasi-territorial dividend exemption represented the most significant reform, but similar movements occurred earlier in the United Kingdom (2009), Japan (2009), and other major economies.

Several factors drove this trend. Competitiveness concerns featured prominently, as companies from credit-method countries faced higher effective rates than competitors from exemption-method jurisdictions when operating in the same markets. The United States experienced substantial accumulation of unrepatriated foreign earnings—exceeding $2 trillion by some estimates—as companies deferred repatriation to avoid the additional US tax layer. Administrative simplicity also favoured exemption, avoiding the complex credit calculations, limitation categories, and cross-crediting issues inherent in credit systems.

Pillar Two changes this calculus by establishing a 15% floor regardless of the relief method chosen. The competitive advantage of exemption over credit diminishes when both must ensure at least 15% taxation. However, Pillar Two does not eliminate exemption methods or require countries to adopt credit systems. Rather, it overlays a minimum tax requirement on whatever domestic and treaty arrangements exist.

The participation exemption remains fully operative for qualifying dividends even under Pillar Two. The difference is that the underlying subsidiary profits will have faced at least 15% taxation through some combination of source country tax and top-up. The exemption continues to prevent additional parent-level taxation on dividend receipt, preserving its role in facilitating profit flows within corporate groups while the minimum tax ensures adequate aggregate taxation of the underlying profits.
