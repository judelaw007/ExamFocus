## Chapter 3.5: Tax Issues Arising from a Change of Residence

### 1. The Tax Implications of Residence Changes

#### 1.1. Competing State Interests

When an individual or company changes tax residence, fundamental tensions arise between the departure state's interest in taxing gains accrued during residence and the arrival state's interest in establishing an appropriate basis for future taxation. The departure state faces potential erosion of its tax base if appreciated assets leave its jurisdiction untaxed, while the arrival state must determine whether to provide a stepped-up cost basis reflecting the value at immigration or to carry over the historical basis from the departure state.

These competing interests produce several categories of tax issues. Exit taxes or deemed dispositions may trigger immediate taxation in the departure state. The arrival state's treatment of the immigrant's cost basis affects future capital gains calculations. Dual residence during transitional periods creates potential double taxation requiring treaty resolution. Anti-avoidance rules may apply to temporary absences specifically designed to exploit residence changes for tax advantage.

#### 1.2. Key Issues on Emigration and Immigration

The departure state typically seeks to preserve its taxing rights over gains accrued during residence through exit taxation mechanisms. These may take the form of actual realisation requirements, deemed dispositions treating assets as sold at fair market value, or extended taxing rights over certain asset categories after emigration.

The arrival state faces different considerations. If it provides a stepped-up cost basis equal to fair market value at immigration, it forgoes tax on pre-arrival appreciation but avoids double taxation. If it requires the immigrant to use the historical cost basis, it captures full appreciation but creates potential double taxation where the departure state has already taxed pre-departure gains.

### 2. Exit Taxation

#### 2.1. Policy Rationale and Concerns

States impose exit taxes to protect their domestic tax base from erosion through emigration. Without such provisions, taxpayers could accrue substantial gains during residence, emigrate to a jurisdiction with lower or no capital gains taxation, and realise those gains without either state collecting tax on the appreciation.

Exit taxes remain controversial for several reasons. They impose tax on unrealised gains, potentially creating liquidity difficulties where the taxpayer has no cash proceeds from which to pay the liability. They may result in double taxation if the arrival state does not provide corresponding relief. Within the European Union, they raise concerns about compatibility with fundamental freedoms, particularly the free movement of persons and establishment. They may also deter legitimate mobility and create administrative complexity.

#### 2.2. United States: Expatriation Tax

The United States imposes an expatriation tax under IRC §877A on "covered expatriates"—US citizens renouncing citizenship or long-term residents terminating their status. An individual becomes a covered expatriate by meeting any of three tests: net worth exceeding $2 million; average annual net income tax liability exceeding approximately $200,000 (indexed annually) over the five preceding years; or failure to certify five-year tax compliance.

The mechanism is mark-to-market: covered expatriates are treated as having sold all worldwide property at fair market value on the day before expatriation. The resulting gain is taxable, though an exclusion amount (approximately $866,000 in 2024, indexed for inflation) reduces the taxable portion. Deferred compensation items, such as retirement accounts, are not subject to immediate mark-to-market taxation but face 30% withholding when distributions occur. *(covered in December 2023)*

The US approach is particularly stringent because it combines citizenship-based taxation during residence with exit taxation on departure, creating what practitioners sometimes describe as a comprehensive departure penalty.

#### 2.3. Canada: Departure Tax

Canada imposes departure tax through a deemed disposition mechanism. When an individual ceases Canadian tax residence, they are treated as having disposed of most property at fair market value on the departure date, triggering capital gains tax on appreciation accrued during Canadian residence.

Significant exceptions apply. Canadian real property is excluded from deemed disposition—it remains subject to Canadian taxation on actual sale regardless of the owner's residence. Registered pension plans, RRSPs, and similar tax-deferred accounts are also excluded from the deemed disposition. Individuals resident in Canada for fewer than sixty months are subject to departure tax only on assets acquired during their Canadian residence, protecting short-term residents from tax on pre-immigration appreciation.

Canada provides a corresponding deemed reacquisition at fair market value, establishing a stepped-up basis for the departing taxpayer's future reference. Taxpayers may elect to defer payment by providing security to the Canada Revenue Agency, and those who return to Canadian residence may elect to unwind the departure tax, reversing the deemed disposition and its tax consequences.

#### 2.4. Australia: CGT Election

Australia's approach offers taxpayers a choice upon ceasing residence. The default rule treats the taxpayer as having disposed of non-Australian assets at fair market value, triggering capital gains tax on pre-departure appreciation. However, taxpayers may elect to remain subject to Australian CGT on worldwide assets, avoiding the deemed disposal.

The election has significant implications. Choosing deemed disposal provides finality—no future Australian CGT obligation arises on those assets. Choosing continued Australian taxation defers any immediate liability but means the taxpayer remains subject to Australian CGT on eventual actual disposal, calculated from the original cost base. The optimal choice depends on expected future appreciation, the taxpayer's likely return to Australia, and comparative tax rates.

The main residence exemption provides additional protection: the principal residence is generally exempt from deemed disposal, with a six-year absence rule permitting continued exemption for temporary departures.

#### 2.5. European Approaches

European jurisdictions have developed varied exit tax regimes, increasingly harmonised through EU directives but retaining national variations.

France imposes exit taxation on individuals holding shareholdings exceeding €800,000 or representing more than 50% ownership in a company, provided the individual was French resident for at least six of the ten years preceding departure. Payment may be deferred for moves within the EU or EEA.

Germany applies exit taxation to shareholdings exceeding 1% in corporations, with a ten-year look-back period affecting returning emigrants who previously triggered exit taxation.

The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), adopted in 2016 with implementation required by 2020, has harmonised exit taxation across member states. The directive requires taxation of unrealised gains on asset transfers while mandating that member states permit payment deferral over five years for intra-EU relocations. This reflects European Court of Justice jurisprudence in cases such as *de Lasteyrie du Saillant* (C-9/02) and *N v. Inspecteur* (C-470/04), which found immediate exit tax collection incompatible with EU fundamental freedoms. The ATAD also requires member states to provide step-up relief to prevent double taxation, though implementation details vary across jurisdictions.

### 3. United Kingdom: Specific Rules

#### 3.1. No General Exit Tax

The United Kingdom does not impose a general exit tax on individuals ceasing UK residence. There is no deemed disposal of worldwide assets on emigration, distinguishing the UK from most other developed economies.

This approach reflects historical policy choices rather than inability to tax emigrants. The UK does impose CGT on non-residents disposing of UK residential property (and, since 2019, certain commercial property), maintaining source-state taxation on immovable assets. However, portfolio investments, foreign property, and other assets may be removed from the UK tax base through emigration without triggering immediate taxation. The temporary non-residence rules, discussed below, provide partial protection against short-term departures designed to realise gains outside UK taxation.

#### 3.2. Split-Year Treatment

The UK Statutory Residence Test provides split-year treatment in specified circumstances, dividing a tax year into resident and non-resident portions rather than applying whole-year residence or non-residence.

Eight cases qualify for split-year treatment. For departures, these include starting full-time work overseas, accompanying a partner starting full-time work overseas, or ceasing to have a UK home. For arrivals, qualifying cases include starting full-time UK work, ceasing full-time overseas work, or starting to have a UK home as sole residence.

During the overseas portion of a split year, the individual is treated as non-resident for most purposes, meaning only UK-source income and gains are taxable. During the UK portion, worldwide income and gains are taxable. This treatment operates under domestic law; treaty residence may differ depending on tie-breaker application. *(covered in June 2022)*

#### 3.3. Temporary Non-Residence Rules

UK temporary non-residence rules prevent individuals from exploiting short periods of non-residence to realise gains outside UK taxation and then returning. The rules apply where an individual was solely UK resident for at least four of the seven tax years preceding departure, the period of non-residence comprises fewer than five complete tax years, and relevant gains or income arise during the non-residence period.

Where these conditions are met, specified gains and income become chargeable in the year of return to UK residence. The rules capture gains on assets held before departure but not assets acquired during non-residence. To avoid the rules, an individual must remain non-resident for at least five complete tax years before returning. *(covered in June 2024)*

### 4. Resolving Double Taxation

#### 4.1. The Step-Up Problem

Exit taxation creates potential double taxation where the departure state taxes pre-departure appreciation and the arrival state subsequently taxes the same appreciation on actual disposal. This occurs when the arrival state uses historical cost basis rather than fair market value at immigration.

Consider an asset acquired for $60,000, worth $100,000 at emigration, and ultimately sold for $150,000. If the departure state imposes exit tax on the $40,000 pre-departure gain and the arrival state taxes gain calculated from the $60,000 original basis (producing a $90,000 gain), total taxation applies to $130,000—exceeding the actual $90,000 economic gain by $40,000.

The solution is a step-up: the arrival state should use fair market value at immigration ($100,000) as the cost basis, producing a $50,000 gain on sale. Combined with the $40,000 departure state gain, total taxation applies to $90,000—matching the actual economic gain.

#### 4.2. Relief Mechanisms

Several mechanisms may prevent or relieve double taxation arising from residence changes. Arrival state step-up provisions, where available, directly prevent double taxation by adjusting the cost basis. Foreign tax credits in the arrival state for exit tax paid to the departure state provide relief where the same gain is taxed twice. Treaty provisions may allocate exclusive taxing rights, though few treaties specifically address exit taxation. The Mutual Agreement Procedure allows competent authorities to resolve cases of unrelieved double taxation through negotiated solutions.

The OECD Commentary encourages states to provide relief mechanisms and discourages exit taxation that results in unrelieved double taxation. However, implementation varies significantly across jurisdictions, and taxpayers changing residence must carefully analyse both departure and arrival state rules to understand their combined effect.

The increasing prevalence of exit taxation reflects broader trends in international tax policy. States facing mobile capital and wealthy individuals have sought to protect their tax bases while balancing concerns about free movement and legitimate migration. The tension between these objectives continues to shape the development of exit tax regimes and the treaty framework addressing residence changes.
