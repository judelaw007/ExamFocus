## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION

### 1. Why Change of Residence Creates Tax Issues

When an individual or company changes tax residence, several competing claims arise:

```
COMPETING STATE INTERESTS ON CHANGE OF RESIDENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                    DEPARTURE STATE          ARRIVAL STATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Interest:           Tax accrued gains       Tax future gains
                    before departure        from arrival date

Concern:            Loss of tax base        Cost base issues
                    on appreciated assets   (step-up or not?)

Mechanism:          Exit tax / deemed       Fresh start or
                    disposal                carryover basis

Anti-avoidance:     Temporary non-          CFC rules on
                    residence rules         former residents
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Key Tax Issues on Change of Residence

| Issue | Description | Exam Relevance |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Exit taxes** | Tax on accrued gains at departure | HIGH - Know country examples |
| **Deemed disposal** | Fiction of selling assets on departure | HIGH - Canada, Australia |
| **Dual residence** | Resident in two states simultaneously | VERY HIGH - Treaty tie-breakers |
| **Split-year treatment** | Part-year residence rules | MEDIUM - UK rules |
| **Temporary non-residence** | Anti-avoidance for short absences | MEDIUM - UK rules |
| **Corporate inversions** | Change of corporate residence | LOW - BEPS context |

---

## B. EXIT TAXES AND DEEMED DISPOSAL

### 1. The Policy Rationale

**Why States Impose Exit Taxes**:
- Protect tax base on gains accrued during residence
- Prevent tax-motivated emigration to low-tax jurisdictions
- Ensure fair contribution before accessing other systems

**Why Exit Taxes Are Controversial**:
- Tax on unrealised gains (no cash to pay)
- Potential double taxation if arrival state doesn't provide step-up
- May deter legitimate mobility
- EU law concerns (freedom of movement)

### 2. Country-Specific Exit Tax Regimes

#### United States: Expatriation Tax (IRC §877A)

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Who is caught** | "Covered expatriates" - citizens renouncing, long-term residents terminating |
| **Covered expatriate tests** | Net worth >$2M OR average tax liability >$206,000 (2024) OR failure to certify 5-year compliance |
| **Mechanism** | Mark-to-market: deemed sale at FMV day before expatriation |
| **Exclusion amount** | First $866,000 (2024) of gain excluded |
| **Deferred compensation** | Subject to 30% withholding when paid |

**US Exit Tax Example**:
```
US CITIZEN RENOUNCING - EXIT TAX CALCULATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Assets:
  House (FMV $1.5M, basis $400K)    Gain: $1,100,000
  Portfolio (FMV $3M, basis $2M)    Gain: $1,000,000
  Retirement accounts               EXCLUDED from mark-to-market
                                    (taxed on distribution)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total deemed gain:                  $2,100,000
Less: Exclusion amount              ($866,000)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Taxable gain:                       $1,234,000
Tax @ 23.8% (max LTCG + NIIT):      $293,692
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### Canada: Departure Tax

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Trigger** | Ceasing to be Canadian tax resident |
| **Mechanism** | Deemed disposition at FMV on departure date |
| **Exceptions** | Canadian real property, business property used in Canada, pension plans |
| **Relief** | Can elect to defer tax with security; "unwind" election if returning |
| **Step-up** | Deemed reacquisition at FMV (fresh basis going forward) |

**Key Canada Feature**: On return to Canada, taxpayer can elect to "unwind" the departure tax, reversing the deemed disposition. This is particularly relevant for temporary assignments abroad.

#### Australia: CGT on Residency Change

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Default rule** | Deemed disposal of non-Australian assets at FMV |
| **Election available** | Can choose to remain subject to Australian CGT on worldwide assets |
| **Effect of election** | No deemed disposal; Australian CGT applies on eventual sale |
| **Main residence** | Exempt from deemed disposal (6-year absence rule) |

**Australia Choice**:
```
AUSTRALIAN EMIGRANT OPTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Option 1: DEFAULT                   Option 2: ELECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Deemed disposal at departure        No deemed disposal

CGT payable now on non-             Assets remain "taxable
Australian assets                   Australian property"

No future Australian CGT            Future CGT on eventual sale
liability                           (from original cost base)

Good if: Assets will appreciate     Good if: Returning to
significantly; lower tax in         Australia; expect lower
new country                         gains; want to defer tax
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### European Examples

| Country | Key Features |
|---------|--------------|
| **France** | Exit tax on >€800K shareholdings or >50% ownership; applies if resident 6/10 years before departure; deferred if moving within EU/EEA |
| **Germany** | Exit tax on >1% shareholdings in corporations; 10-year look-back for returning emigrants |
| **Norway** | 2024 reforms: must settle tax within 12 years regardless of sale; 3M NOK exemption |
| **Spain** | Exit tax if resident 10/15 years; extended 5-year tax on worldwide income if moving to tax haven |
| **Netherlands** | Conservative tax claim on substantial shareholdings (>5%); deferred within EU |

#### United Kingdom: No General Exit Tax

**Key Point**: The UK does **not** impose a general exit tax on individuals ceasing UK residence.

| What UK Does | What UK Does NOT Do |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Temporary non-residence rules | General deemed disposal on departure |
| Extended CGT on UK residential property | Exit tax on worldwide assets |
| Remittance basis charge for non-doms | Mark-to-market on emigration |

### 3. Double Taxation Issues

**The Core Problem**:
```
DOUBLE TAXATION ON RESIDENCE CHANGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                        DEPARTURE        ARRIVAL          ACTUAL
                        STATE            STATE            SALE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Asset value:            $100,000         $100,000         $150,000
Cost base:              $60,000          ???              ???
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Scenario A: No step-up in arrival state
  Departure tax: $100K - $60K = $40K gain (taxed)
  On sale: $150K - $60K = $90K gain (taxed)
  TOTAL TAX BASE: $130K (exceeds actual $90K gain)

Scenario B: Step-up to FMV in arrival state
  Departure tax: $100K - $60K = $40K gain (taxed)
  On sale: $150K - $100K = $50K gain (taxed)
  TOTAL TAX BASE: $90K (equals actual gain)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Step-up provision** in arrival state
2. **Foreign tax credit** for exit tax paid
3. **Treaty provisions** allocating exclusive taxing rights
4. **Mutual Agreement Procedure** for unrelieved double taxation

---

## C. DUAL RESIDENCE AND TREATY TIE-BREAKERS

### 1. When Dual Residence Arises

Dual residence occurs when an individual is **simultaneously resident** in two states under their respective domestic laws:

| Common Scenarios | State A Basis | State B Basis |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Relocation mid-year** | Domicile retained | Physical presence met |
| **Cross-border commuter** | Family home | Employment location |
| **Extended assignment** | Ties maintained | Days threshold exceeded |
| **Student abroad** | Home maintained | Presence for studies |
| **Retirement migration** | Home country ties | New permanent residence |

### 2. Article 4 OECD MTC Tie-Breaker Rules

**The Sequential Tests** (Article 4(2)):

```
TREATY TIE-BREAKER SEQUENCE - INDIVIDUALS (ARTICLE 4(2))
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 1: PERMANENT HOME TEST
         → If home in ONE state only: Resident there (STOP)
         → If home in BOTH states: Apply CVI sub-test
              └─ CENTRE OF VITAL INTERESTS (sub-test)
                 → Closer personal AND economic relations
                 → If CVI resolves: Resident there (STOP)
                 → If CVI indeterminate: Go to Step 2
         → If home in NEITHER state: Go to Step 2

STEP 2: HABITUAL ABODE
         ↓ If in both states or neither...
STEP 3: NATIONALITY
         ↓ If national of both or neither...
STEP 4: MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Detailed Analysis of Each Test

#### Test 1: Permanent Home

**Definition**: A dwelling available to the individual on a continuous basis (not occasional), which they maintain and use regularly.

| Permanent Home | NOT Permanent Home |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Owned house maintained while abroad | Hotel room during assignment |
| Rented apartment retained long-term | Short-term rental |
| Family home available for use | House rented out to third parties |
| Dwelling always available | Accommodation provided by employer term-by-term |

**Exam Application** (June 2022 Mykola, June 2025 Amelie):
- Look for owned property retained in departure state
- Consider whether property remains "available" (not rented out)
- Temporary accommodation in arrival state often not "permanent"

#### Test 2: Centre of Vital Interests

**Factors Considered**:

| Personal Relations | Economic Relations |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Family location (spouse, children) | Employment location |
| Social connections | Business interests |
| Cultural/religious ties | Bank accounts |
| Political activities | Investment location |
| Club memberships | Professional registrations |

**Key Principle**: Look at the **totality of circumstances** - where is the individual's life truly centred?

**Common Exam Scenario**:
```
TYPICAL CENTRE OF VITAL INTERESTS ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                        COUNTRY U           COUNTRY X
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Family:                 Spouse + children   None
Employment:             Long-term employer  Temporary project
Property:               Family home owned   Rented apartment
Bank accounts:          Main accounts       Expense account
Social ties:            15 years residence  Recently arrived
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CONCLUSION: Centre of vital interests in Country U
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### Test 3: Habitual Abode

**When Applied**: Only if permanent home in both states or neither, AND centre of vital interests cannot be determined.

**Meaning**: Where does the individual have the **habit of living**? Looks at pattern of presence over time, not just a single year.

**Exam Tip**: This test is rarely determinative in exam scenarios - most cases resolve at permanent home or centre of vital interests.

#### Test 4: Nationality

**Application**: Only if habitual abode doesn't resolve, individual is a national of one state only.

**Exam Note**: Rarely reached in practice. If mentioned in exam facts, may be a red herring or relevant if previous tests inconclusive.

#### Test 5: Mutual Agreement Procedure

**When Reached**: If dual national or national of neither state, and previous tests inconclusive.

**Consequence**: States must agree; taxpayer faces uncertainty pending resolution.

### 4. Corporate Dual Residence

**Article 4(3)** provides tie-breaker for companies:

| Pre-2017 Rule | Post-2017 Rule (MLI Article 4) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Place of Effective Management (POEM) | Case-by-case MAP determination |

**POEM Factors**:
- Where board meetings held
- Where key management decisions made
- Where strategic direction determined
- NOT merely where day-to-day operations occur

---

## D. SPLIT-YEAR TREATMENT

### 1. The Concept

**Split-year treatment** divides a tax year into:
- **Resident portion**: Taxed on worldwide income
- **Non-resident portion**: Taxed only on source income

**Without Split-Year**: Individual is resident for entire year OR non-resident for entire year based on status at particular point (often year-end).

### 2. UK Split-Year Rules

The UK Statutory Residence Test (SRT) provides **8 cases** for split-year treatment:

**Leaving the UK** (Cases 1-3):
| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Case 1 | Starting full-time work overseas |
| Case 2 | Partner starting full-time work overseas |
| Case 3 | Ceasing to have UK home |

**Arriving in the UK** (Cases 4-8):
| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Case 4 | Starting full-time work in UK |
| Case 5 | Ceasing full-time work overseas |
| Case 6 | Partner ceasing full-time work overseas |
| Case 7 | Starting to have UK home only |
| Case 8 | Starting to have UK home (various) |

**Exam Relevance**: UK split-year is domestic law, not treaty-based. Most exam questions focus on treaty tie-breakers rather than domestic split-year rules.

### 3. Interaction with Treaties

**Important Distinction**:
- **Domestic split-year**: Determines residence under internal law
- **Treaty residence**: Determined under Article 4, may differ from domestic position
- **Result**: Can be treaty-resident in one state while domestically non-resident in part of year

---

## E. TEMPORARY NON-RESIDENCE RULES

### 1. UK Temporary Non-Residence (TNR) Rules

**Purpose**: Prevent individuals leaving the UK for short periods to realise gains/income outside UK tax net, then returning.

**Conditions for TNR Rules to Apply**:
1. "Sole UK residence" for at least 4 of 7 years preceding departure
2. Period of non-residence less than 5 complete tax years
3. Gains/income arose during non-residence period

**Effect**: Specified gains and income become chargeable in **year of return**.

### 2. What Is Caught by TNR Rules

| Caught | Not Caught |
|--------|------------|
| Gains on assets held before departure | Gains on assets acquired during non-residence |
| Certain dividend income | Employment income earned abroad |
| Distributions from close companies | Interest income |
| Gains on assets connected to pre-departure period | Trading profits |

### 3. Planning Implications

**To Avoid TNR Rules**:
- Remain non-resident for **5 complete tax years**
- Dispose of appreciated assets before leaving (realise gains as resident)
- Defer return until 5-year period satisfied

**Exam Application**: If UK resident leaves briefly, realises gains, and returns within 5 years, TNR rules likely apply.

## F. GLOBAL TRENDS AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS

### The Global Trend Toward Exit Taxation

**Historical Development**:
Exit taxes have proliferated significantly since 2000, driven by:
1. **Capital mobility**: Easier to relocate with wealth intact
2. **BEPS concerns**: Fear of losing tax base to low-tax jurisdictions
3. **Aging populations**: Wealthy retirees moving to tax-favourable locations
4. **Revenue pressures**: Governments seeking to protect domestic tax claims

**European Union Developments**:

The EU has grappled with tension between exit taxes and free movement:

| Case | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| *de Lasteyrie du Saillant* (C-9/02) | French exit tax violated freedom of establishment |
| *N v. Inspecteur* (C-470/04) | Dutch rules disproportionate due to security requirement |
| **ATAD (2016)** | Harmonised exit tax rules with payment deferral within EU |

**Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD)** provisions:
- Exit taxation required on transfer of assets between states
- Payment may be deferred over 5 years for intra-EU moves
- Step-up provisions to prevent double taxation

### The US Unique Position

The US is unique in combining:
1. **Citizenship-based taxation** (ongoing obligation)
2. **Exit tax on renunciation** (departure penalty)
3. **No arrival step-up** for incoming residents on foreign assets

This creates "Hotel California" effect - difficult to leave US tax system cleanly.

### Corporate Inversions and Anti-Inversion Rules

**What Is a Corporate Inversion?**
Restructuring where a US parent becomes subsidiary of foreign parent, typically in low-tax jurisdiction, while maintaining US operations.

**US Anti-Inversion Rules (IRC §7874)**:

| Foreign Ownership | Treatment |
|-------------------|-----------|
| <60% | Inversion respected |
| 60-80% | "Surrogate foreign corporation" - some US tax continues |
| >80% | Foreign corporation treated as US corporation for tax |

**Post-TCJA (2017)**: Corporate inversions have declined significantly due to:
- Reduced US corporate rate (35% → 21%)
- GILTI provisions taxing foreign subsidiary income
- BEAT provisions limiting deductions to foreign related parties

### Treaty Implications of Residence Changes

**Article 4 Commentary Developments**:

The 2017 OECD MTC update modified the corporate tie-breaker (Article 4(3)):
- Pre-2017: POEM determined treaty residence
- Post-2017: Case-by-case determination through MAP

**Rationale**: POEM too easily manipulated; case-by-case allows consideration of all factors including where incorporated, where managed, where shareholders located.

### Double Taxation Relief Mechanisms

When exit taxes create double taxation, relief may come from:

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Step-up in arrival state** | Arrival state uses FMV at immigration as cost base |
| **FTC for exit tax** | Arrival state credits exit tax against its CGT |
| **Treaty override** | Treaty may allocate exclusive taxing right, preventing exit tax |
| **MAP resolution** | Competent authorities agree allocation of taxing rights |
| **Domestic credit** | Exit state credits future foreign tax against exit tax |

**OECD Commentary Position**: Exit taxes should not result in double taxation; states encouraged to provide relief mechanisms.

## G. EXAM APPLICATION

### Systematic Approach to Change of Residence Questions

**Step 1: Identify Domestic Residence Status in Each State**

| State | Residence Test | Apply Facts | Conclusion |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| State A | [Insert rule] | [Apply] | Resident/Non-resident |
| State B | [Insert rule] | [Apply] | Resident/Non-resident |

**Step 2: If Dual Resident - Apply Treaty Tie-Breakers**

```
TIE-BREAKER ANALYSIS TEMPLATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Test 1 - Permanent Home:
  State A: [Describe dwelling and availability]
  State B: [Describe dwelling and availability]
  RESULT: Permanent home in [State A/State B/Both/Neither]

Test 2 - Centre of Vital Interests (if needed):
  Personal ties: [Compare]
  Economic ties: [Compare]
  RESULT: Centre in [State A/State B/Cannot determine]

Test 3 - Habitual Abode (if needed):
  Pattern of presence: [Analyse]
  RESULT: Habitual abode in [State A/State B/Both/Neither]

Test 4 - Nationality (if needed):
  RESULT: National of [State A/State B/Both/Neither]

CONCLUSION: Treaty resident of [State] for purposes of DTC
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Step 3: Consider Exit Tax/Deemed Disposal Issues**

- Does departure state impose exit tax?
- What assets are within scope?
- What relief mechanisms exist?
- How does arrival state treat cost base?

**Step 4: Identify Double Taxation and Relief**

- Dual taxation exposure on same income/gains
- Treaty relief (credit method vs exemption method)
- Domestic relief in each state

### Worked Example: Change of Residence Scenario

**Based on June 2022 Q7 Pattern (Mykola)**

```
SCENARIO FACTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Petra, resident of Country A, sent to Country B for 8-month project
• Lives with partner and children in Country A (owned home)
• Country A: Non-resident after 8 months consecutive absence
• Country B: Resident if present >183 days (backdated to arrival)
• Petra present in Country B: January 1 - September 5 (248 days)
• Rental apartment in Country B provided by employer
• Bank account and investment property in Country B from prior visits
• Returns to Country A September 5
• DTC mirrors OECD MTC 2017
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ANALYSIS

Step 1: Domestic Residence Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Country A: Absent January 1 - September 5 = 8 months exactly
           Non-resident status requires 8+ months absence
           BORDERLINE - arguably still resident

Country B: Present 248 days > 183 days
           Backdated to January 1
           RESIDENT of Country B for Year One

Result: Likely DUAL RESIDENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 2: Treaty Tie-Breaker Analysis (Article 4(2))
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Test 1 - Permanent Home:
  Country A: Owned home with family - PERMANENT HOME ✓
  Country B: Employer-provided rental apartment - likely NOT permanent
             (temporary, tied to project duration)
             Investment property rented out - NOT available to Petra

  RESULT: Permanent home in Country A only
  → Country A is treaty residence; no need for further tests
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 3: Tax Consequences
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Petra is treaty resident of Country A
• Employment income: Article 15 applies
  - Exercised in Country B, so Country B has source right
  - Country A taxes as residence state but must give credit
• Investment property income (Country B): Article 6
  - Country B taxes (situs of property)
  - Country A taxes worldwide, gives credit
• Bank interest (Country B): Article 11
  - Taxable only in Country A (residence state) under OECD MTC
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCLUSION
Petra is treaty resident of Country A throughout Year One. Despite
meeting Country B's 183-day threshold, the tie-breaker resolves in
favour of Country A due to permanent home with family. Country A taxes
worldwide income with credit for Country B source taxes.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## H. COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

```
ERROR PREVENTION CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ WRONG: Skipping domestic residence analysis
✓ RIGHT: Always establish domestic residence in EACH state
         before considering treaty

❌ WRONG: Applying tie-breakers when not dual resident
✓ RIGHT: Tie-breakers only needed if resident in BOTH states
         under domestic law

❌ WRONG: Treating all dwellings as "permanent homes"
✓ RIGHT: Permanent home requires availability, permanence,
         and actual use - not just ownership

❌ WRONG: Jumping to nationality before exhausting other tests
✓ RIGHT: Apply tests SEQUENTIALLY - stop when one resolves

❌ WRONG: Ignoring treaty when discussing exit tax
✓ RIGHT: Treaty may allocate exclusive rights, overriding
         domestic exit tax provisions

❌ WRONG: Assuming arrival state provides step-up
✓ RIGHT: State the rule in that jurisdiction; not automatic

❌ WRONG: Confusing domestic split-year with treaty residence
✓ RIGHT: These are SEPARATE concepts - split-year is domestic,
         treaty residence is per Article 4
