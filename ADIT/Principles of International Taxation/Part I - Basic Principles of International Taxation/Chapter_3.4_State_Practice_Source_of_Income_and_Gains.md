Frequency: 30% (3/10 papers direct testing 2020-2025)
Mark Range: 15-25 marks when directly tested
Syllabus Level: 2 (detailed knowledge required)

Key Question Patterns:
  • June 2023 Q7: Source taxation of non-resident performers (25 marks)
  • June 2023 Q6: Employment income source (DynaCorp - 25 marks)
  • December 2023 Q6: Immovable property situs/source (Angelica - 25 marks)

Strategic Priority: ★★★★☆ HIGH - FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHY THIS MATTERS: Source rules determine whether a state can tax
non-residents. Every treaty article allocating taxing rights implicitly
applies source principles. Understanding source is essential for
analyzing any cross-border income scenario.

## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION

### 1. What Is "Source" of Income?

**Definition**: The **source** of income refers to the geographic location where income is deemed to originate or arise. It determines which state has the territorial connection to tax that income.

**Key Principle**: Source-based taxation allows a state to tax income arising within its territory, **regardless of the taxpayer's residence**.

### 2. Why Source Matters

| Purpose | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Non-resident taxation** | Determines if state can tax non-residents |
| **Treaty allocation** | Identifies which state is "source" vs "residence" |
| **Double taxation relief** | Foreign tax credit limited to tax on foreign-source income |
| **Withholding taxes** | Source state withholds tax at source on payments to non-residents |

### 3. The Fundamental Problem

**Different states use different source rules**. Income that is "sourced" in Country A under its domestic law may not be "sourced" there under Country B's rules—creating potential:
- **Double source taxation**: Two countries both claim income as sourced there
- **Nowhere taxation**: Neither country claims the income

**Treaties resolve this** by providing uniform allocation rules that override domestic source rules between treaty partners.

## B. SOURCE RULES BY INCOME TYPE

### 1. Employment Income (Services)

**General Rule**: Income from employment is sourced where the **services are performed**.

**OECD MTC Article 15**: Employment income taxable in state where employment exercised.

| Scenario | Source State | Basis |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Work performed in Country X | Country X | Place of performance |
| Work performed in multiple countries | Apportioned by days worked | Pro-rata allocation |
| Remote work from Country A for Country B employer | Country A | Where services performed |

**The 183-Day Exception (Article 15(2))**:
Income remains taxable **only** in residence state if ALL conditions met:
1. Recipient present in source state ≤183 days in any 12-month period
2. Remuneration paid by employer NOT resident in source state
3. Remuneration NOT borne by PE in source state

```
EXAMPLE: Employment Income Sourcing
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Employee resident in France
Works for French employer
Sent to Germany for 120 days (within 12 months)
Salary €100,000

Source Analysis:
  Work in France: 245 days → €67,123 French-source
  Work in Germany: 120 days → €32,877 German-source

BUT Article 15(2) applies to German portion:
  ✓ <183 days in Germany
  ✓ Paid by French employer (not German resident)
  ✓ Not borne by German PE

Result: ALL €100,000 taxable only in France
(Germany waives source taxation under treaty)
```

### 2. Business Profits

**General Rule**: Business profits sourced where **permanent establishment (PE)** located.

**OECD MTC Article 7**: Business profits taxable only in residence state UNLESS carried on through PE in source state.

| Scenario | Source Taxation? |
|----------|-----------------|
| Sales to foreign customers (no PE) | No source taxation |
| PE in Country X | Profits attributable to PE taxable in X |
| Services performed via PE | PE state can tax |

**Key Principle**: Without PE, no source-state taxation of business profits under treaties.

### 3. Dividends

**General Rule**: Dividends sourced in state where **paying company is resident**.

**OECD MTC Article 10**: Limited source taxation (WHT) permitted:
- 5% if beneficial owner is company holding ≥25% (direct dividends)
- 15% in other cases

| Dividend Payer | Source | WHT under Treaty |
|---------------|--------|------------------|
| UK company | UK | UK can withhold (typically 0-15%) |
| US company | USA | US can withhold (typically 0-15%) |
| Foreign subsidiary of UK parent | Foreign country | That country can withhold |

### 4. Interest

**General Rule**: Interest sourced in state where **payer is resident** (or where PE bearing interest located).

**OECD MTC Article 11**: Limited source taxation permitted (typically 10% WHT or lower).

**Special Rules**:
- Interest paid by PE → sourced where PE located
- Many treaties provide 0% WHT (UK-US, UK-Germany)

### 5. Royalties

**General Rule**: Royalties sourced where **IP is used** or where **payer is resident** (varies by jurisdiction).

**OECD MTC Article 12**: Royalties taxable ONLY in residence state (no source WHT).

**BUT many actual treaties** permit source taxation:
- UN Model: 10-15% WHT permitted
- US treaties: Often permit source taxation
- Many bilateral treaties: Vary widely

| State Practice | Royalty Source Rule |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **OECD Model** | Residence only |
| **UN Model** | Source can tax (limited WHT) |
| **US domestic** | Place of use |
| **UK domestic** | Payer residence |

### 6. Capital Gains

**General Rules** (Article 13 OECD MTC):

| Asset Type | Source Rule | Treaty Article |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Immovable property** | Where property located (situs) | Art. 13(1) |
| **PE business property** | Where PE located | Art. 13(2) |
| **Ships/aircraft (international)** | POEM of enterprise | Art. 13(3) |
| **Shares >50% immovable** | Where immovable located | Art. 13(4) |
| **Other property** | Residence only | Art. 13(5) |

**Immovable Property Rule** (Article 13(1)):
Gains from alienation of immovable property may be taxed in the state where the property is **situated** (situs rule).

```
EXAMPLE: Capital Gains Sourcing
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
German resident sells:
  1. UK warehouse → UK-source (Art 13(1))
  2. Shares in UK Co owning UK land (70% value) → UK-source (Art 13(4))
  3. Shares in UK trading company → German-source only (Art 13(5))
  4. US shares → German-source only (Art 13(5))

UK can tax gains 1 and 2
Germany can tax all gains (residence)
Relief: Germany credits UK tax paid
```

## C. STATE PRACTICE: DOMESTIC SOURCE RULES

### 1. United States (IRC §§861-865)

**Detailed statutory source rules**:

| Income Type | US Source If... |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Interest** | Paid by US person (or US PE) |
| **Dividends** | Paid by US corporation |
| **Employment** | Services performed in US |
| **Royalties** | Property used in US |
| **Sales of goods** | Title passage test (negotiable) |
| **Capital gains** | Generally residence (but real property = situs) |

**Significance**: US source rules are highly detailed and can create mismatches with treaty partner classifications.

### 2. United Kingdom

**Less codified approach**:

| Income Type | UK Source If... |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Employment** | Duties performed in UK |
| **Trading profits** | Trade carried on in UK |
| **Interest** | Paid by UK resident (generally) |
| **Dividends** | Paid by UK company |
| **Rent** | UK property |
| **Gains** | UK assets (including UK shares pre-April 2019) |

**Key Point**: UK has narrow territorial source rules for non-residents, focusing on UK-situs property and UK-performed activities.

### 3. Germany

**Comprehensive domestic source rules** (§49 EStG):

| Income Type | German Source If... |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Employment** | Work performed in Germany |
| **Business** | PE in Germany |
| **Investment income** | German debtor/payer |
| **Real property** | Property in Germany |
| **Gains** | German-situs property |

---

## D. TREATY MODIFICATION OF SOURCE RULES

### 1. How Treaties Override Domestic Source Rules

**Principle**: Treaties allocate taxing rights based on agreed source rules that may differ from either state's domestic law.

**Example**:
- Domestic law: Royalties sourced where IP used
- Treaty: Royalties taxable only in residence state
- Result: Treaty overrides domestic source taxation

### 2. Re-Sourcing Under Treaties

Some treaties explicitly **re-source** income for treaty purposes:

**US Practice**: If income is US-source under domestic law but foreign-source under treaty, taxpayer can elect treaty treatment. This affects Foreign Tax Credit calculations.

### 3. Source Conflicts and Resolution

| Conflict Type | Example | Resolution |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| **Both claim source** | Both states say interest sourced there | Treaty allocation determines |
| **Neither claims source** | Royalties: payer test vs. use test | May lead to under-taxation |
| **Domestic vs. treaty** | Domestic says source, treaty says not | Treaty prevails |

## E. POLICY PERSPECTIVES: RESIDENCE VS SOURCE TAXATION

### The Historical Compromise

The current international tax framework, developed in the 1920s under the League of Nations, represents a **compromise** between capital-exporting countries (favouring residence taxation) and capital-importing countries (favouring source taxation):

**1923 Economists' Report**: Recommended primary residence-state taxation with limited source-state rights

**1928 Model Conventions**: Established framework that:
- Business profits: Source only if PE exists
- Passive income: Limited source WHT, primary residence taxation
- Immovable property: Full source-state rights

This compromise has persisted for nearly a century but faces increasing challenges.

### Challenges to Traditional Source Rules

**Digital Economy**: Traditional source rules assume physical presence creates economic nexus. Digital businesses can generate substantial revenue without physical presence:

| Traditional Source | Digital Reality |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Services sourced where performed | Services delivered remotely |
| PE required for business profits | Value created by users/data |
| Sales sourced at title passage | Digital goods have no "location" |

**Pillar One's Market-Based Approach**: Represents a partial shift from traditional source to market/destination taxation for largest MNEs.

### Developing Country Perspectives

The UN Model Convention provides broader source-state taxation rights, reflecting developing country interests:

| Issue | OECD Model | UN Model |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Services PE** | No specific provision | Article 5(3)(b) - services PE |
| **Royalties** | Residence only | Source can tax (Art. 12) |
| **Technical fees** | No separate article | Article 12A - source can tax |
| **Capital gains** | Limited source rights | Broader source rights (Art. 13) |

#### The Source Erosion Problem

Aggressive tax planning has exploited source rule gaps:

**Stateless Income**: Structures where income has no taxable source:
```
Structure Example:
  IP held by Irish subsidiary
  Royalties paid to Ireland → low Irish tax
  Irish sub has no real substance
  Income escapes meaningful taxation

BEPS Response:
  Substance requirements
  PE anti-avoidance rules
  Interest deduction limits
```

## G. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLE

### June 2023, Question 7 - Azurian Music Festival (25 marks)

**Scenario Summary**:
- Non-resident musicians perform at festival in Azuria
- Receive: (a) Performance fee from festival organizers, (b) TV appearance fee from Azurian TV network
- Azuria has OECD-based treaty with musicians' residence states

**Model Answer**:

**Part 1: Taxing Rights under OECD MTC (15 marks)**

**Article 17 (Entertainers and Sportspersons)**

Article 17 provides that income derived by an entertainer from personal activities as such exercised in a Contracting State may be taxed in that State, notwithstanding Articles 7 and 15.

This is an **exception** to the normal source rules:
- Article 7: Business profits require PE
- Article 15: Employment income subject to 183-day exception
- Article 17: No exceptions—source state can ALWAYS tax performers

**Application to Scenario**:

*Festival Performance Fee*:
- Personal activity as entertainer exercised in Azuria
- Article 17 applies
- Azuria (source state) has **unrestricted taxing right**
- No PE or 183-day exception applies

*TV Appearance Fee*:
- Also personal activity as entertainer in Azuria
- Paid by Azurian TV network (Azurian-source)
- Article 17 applies equally
- Azuria has **unrestricted taxing right**

**Rationale for Article 17**:
- Entertainers often highly paid for short performances
- Without special rule, 183-day exception would exempt most performer income
- Source states want to tax value created by performances in their territory

**Part 2: Information Exchange (10 marks)**

[Analysis of Article 26 exchange of information provisions...]

**Conclusion**:
Azuria has full taxing rights over both income streams under Article 17. The non-resident performers' residence states must provide relief (typically FTC) to prevent double taxation.

## H. COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

| Error | Impact | Prevention |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Applying wrong source rule for income type | 4-5 marks | Identify income category first |
| Forgetting Article 17 exception for performers | 3-4 marks | Check if entertainer/sportsperson |
| Missing 183-day exception for employment | 3-4 marks | Always check three conditions |
| Confusing situs with source | 2-3 marks | Situs = property location; source = income origin |
| Assuming domestic rules override treaty | 3-4 marks | Treaty prevails between treaty partners |
| Not distinguishing OECD from UN Model | 2-3 marks | Note which model applies |
