## Chapter 3.4: State Practice in Determining the Source of Income and Gains

### 1. The Concept of Source in International Taxation

#### 1.1. Source as a Connecting Factor

The source of income refers to the geographic location where income is deemed to originate or arise. Unlike residence, which establishes a personal connection between a taxpayer and a state, source creates a territorial connection between income and a state. Source-based taxation allows a jurisdiction to tax income arising within its territory regardless of the taxpayer's residence, reflecting the principle that states have a legitimate interest in taxing economic activity occurring within their borders.

Source rules serve several critical functions in international taxation. They determine whether a state can impose tax on non-residents, identify which state qualifies as the "source state" for treaty allocation purposes, define the scope of foreign-source income eligible for foreign tax credit relief, and establish the basis for withholding taxes on cross-border payments.

#### 1.2. The Interaction of Source and Residence

The fundamental challenge of international taxation arises from the interaction between source and residence principles. Different states apply different source rules, and income that one country treats as arising within its territory may not be so treated by another. This creates potential for both double taxation—where two states each claim the income as sourced within their jurisdiction—and double non-taxation, where neither state treats the income as sourced there.

Tax treaties address these conflicts by establishing uniform allocation rules that override domestic source classifications between treaty partners. However, treaties operate bilaterally; they cannot resolve source conflicts involving third states or situations where no treaty exists.

### 2. Source Rules by Income Type

#### 2.1. Employment Income

Employment income is generally sourced where the services are physically performed, regardless of where the employer is located or where payment is made. This principle applies whether the employee works for a domestic or foreign employer.

Article 15 of the OECD Model Tax Convention confirms this approach, providing that employment income may be taxed in the state where the employment is exercised. When an employee works in multiple countries, the income is typically apportioned based on working days in each jurisdiction.

The 183-day exception under Article 15(2) modifies this general rule. Employment income remains taxable only in the residence state if three conditions are satisfied: the employee is present in the source state for no more than 183 days in any twelve-month period; the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in the source state; and the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment in the source state. This exception facilitates short-term cross-border assignments without triggering source-state taxation.

Article 17 provides a notable exception for entertainers and sportspersons. Income from personal activities exercised in a state may be taxed there regardless of the normal employment or business profit rules, reflecting the policy that performers earning substantial fees from brief appearances should be subject to source taxation. *(covered in June 2023)*

#### 2.2. Business Profits

Business profits are sourced where the enterprise conducts its activities, but the treaty framework imposes a significant threshold: under Article 7 of the OECD Model, business profits are taxable only in the enterprise's residence state unless the business is carried on through a permanent establishment in the source state.

The permanent establishment concept thus becomes the gateway for source-state taxation of business profits. Without a PE, a foreign enterprise can conduct substantial commercial activity—selling goods, providing services remotely, licensing intellectual property—without creating taxable presence. This principle, established in the 1920s framework, assumed that meaningful economic activity required physical presence. *(covered in June 2024)*

When a PE exists, the source state may tax profits attributable to that establishment. The profit attribution rules under Article 7 treat the PE as if it were a separate enterprise dealing at arm's length with other parts of the same legal entity, ensuring that source-state taxation corresponds to genuine economic activity rather than mere formal presence.

#### 2.3. Passive Income: Dividends, Interest, and Royalties

For passive income categories, source is typically determined by reference to the payer's characteristics rather than where economic activity occurs.

Dividends are sourced in the state where the paying company is resident. Article 10 of the OECD Model permits limited source-state taxation through withholding, typically at 5% for substantial corporate shareholders and 15% for other recipients, while preserving the residence state's primary taxing right.

Interest follows a similar pattern: it is sourced where the borrower is resident, or where a permanent establishment bearing the interest expense is located. Article 11 permits limited source withholding, though many bilateral treaties reduce or eliminate this, particularly between developed economies. The UK-US and UK-Germany treaties, for example, provide for zero withholding on interest.

Royalties present greater variation in state practice. The OECD Model Article 12 provides that royalties are taxable only in the residence state, eliminating source-state withholding entirely. However, this represents an OECD-country perspective; the UN Model permits source taxation, and many bilateral treaties—particularly those involving developing countries—include withholding provisions. Domestic law approaches also vary: some states source royalties based on where the intellectual property is used, while others focus on the payer's residence.

#### 2.4. Capital Gains

Article 13 of the OECD Model establishes a hierarchy of source rules for capital gains that reflects the nature of the underlying asset.

Gains from immovable property are sourced where the property is situated, following the situs principle. This includes not only direct sales but also sales of shares deriving more than 50% of their value from immovable property in a state, preventing avoidance through corporate structures. *(covered in December 2022)*

Gains from movable property forming part of a permanent establishment's business assets may be taxed where the PE is located, extending source-state rights to business-related disposals. Gains from ships and aircraft in international traffic are sourced at the enterprise's place of effective management.

For all other property—including portfolio shares and most financial instruments—gains are taxable only in the seller's residence state. This residual rule means that pure investment gains generally escape source taxation, concentrating taxing rights in the investor's home jurisdiction.

### 3. Domestic Source Rules: State Practice

#### 3.1. United States

The United States maintains the most detailed statutory source rules in its Internal Revenue Code, sections 861 through 865. These provisions specify source for each major income category with considerable precision.

Interest is US-source if paid by a US person or by a foreign person's US permanent establishment. Dividends are US-source if paid by domestic corporations or by foreign corporations with substantial effectively connected income. Compensation for services is sourced where the services are performed. Royalties are sourced where the property generating them is used.

For sales of personal property, section 865 applies a residence-of-seller rule as the general principle, with exceptions for inventory property (sourced based on title passage or production location) and depreciable property (sourced based on prior depreciation deductions). Sales of real property follow the situs principle.

The comprehensiveness of US source rules creates both clarity and potential for mismatches with treaty partner classifications, requiring careful analysis of both domestic law and applicable treaty provisions.

#### 3.2. United Kingdom

The United Kingdom takes a less codified approach, with source rules developed through case law and statutory provisions specific to each income category. Employment income is UK-source when duties are performed in the UK. Trading income is UK-source when the trade is carried on in the UK, determined by examining where contracts are concluded and operations conducted.

Interest and dividends are generally sourced based on the payer's residence, though specific rules apply to UK permanent establishments of foreign entities. Rental income follows the situs of the property. Capital gains on UK assets may be taxable for non-residents, with the scope of UK-situs assets having been narrowed over time—particularly since April 2019, when the charge on non-residents disposing of UK shares was largely removed except for property-rich companies.

#### 3.3. Civil Law Jurisdictions

Germany exemplifies the continental European approach, with comprehensive source rules in section 49 of the Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz). German-source income includes employment performed in Germany, business conducted through a German PE, investment income from German debtors, and gains from German-situs property.

France and other civil law jurisdictions follow similar patterns, though with variations in specific categories. The interaction between domestic source rules and treaty provisions requires careful analysis in each case, as domestic characterisation may differ from treaty classification.

### 4. Treaty Modification of Source Rules

#### 4.1. The Treaty Framework

Tax treaties fundamentally modify the operation of domestic source rules between contracting states. A treaty does not change whether income is "sourced" in a state as a matter of domestic law; rather, it allocates taxing rights and may require the source state to reduce or eliminate taxation that domestic law would otherwise permit.

For example, domestic law may treat all interest paid by residents as locally sourced and subject to withholding tax. A treaty may reduce the permitted withholding rate or eliminate it entirely, but the income remains domestic-source for other purposes such as foreign tax credit calculations.

#### 4.2. Resolving Source Conflicts

Source conflicts between states take several forms. Both states may claim income as sourced within their territory—common where one applies a payer-residence test and another applies a place-of-use test for the same payment. Neither state may claim the income, creating potential for under-taxation. Domestic characterisation may conflict with treaty classification.

Treaties resolve bilateral conflicts through their allocation provisions. However, triangular situations involving third states, or situations where treaties provide different results depending on which state's treaty is applied, require careful analysis of each applicable instrument.

### 5. Evolving Concepts of Source

#### 5.1. The Digital Economy Challenge

Traditional source rules assume that meaningful economic activity requires physical presence in a jurisdiction. Digital business models challenge this assumption fundamentally. An enterprise can generate substantial revenue from customers in a country without any physical presence there—no employees, no office, no warehouse—conducting its entire business through digital platforms and remote service delivery.

Under traditional rules, such an enterprise would have no taxable presence in the market country despite substantial economic engagement with its consumers. This disconnect between economic activity and taxable presence has driven significant reform efforts.

#### 5.2. Market-Based Approaches

The OECD/G20 Pillar One framework represents a partial departure from traditional source concepts toward market-based taxation. For the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises, Pillar One would allocate a portion of residual profits to market jurisdictions based on revenue sourced to those markets, regardless of physical presence.

This approach redefines source for a subset of income, treating market presence as a sufficient connection for taxation. While Pillar One applies only to enterprises exceeding substantial revenue and profitability thresholds, it signals a conceptual shift that may influence broader developments in source-based taxation.

The UN Model has long provided broader source-state rights than the OECD Model, reflecting developing country perspectives. Article 12A on technical services fees and expanded PE definitions for services demonstrate alternative approaches to creating source-state taxing rights where traditional concepts would deny them.

These developments suggest that source concepts will continue to evolve, with increasing tension between the historical framework developed for industrial economies and the realities of globalised, digitalised commerce.
