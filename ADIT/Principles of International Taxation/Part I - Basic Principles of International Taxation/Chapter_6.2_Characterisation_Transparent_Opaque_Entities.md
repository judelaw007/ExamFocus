## Chapter 6.2: Characterisation of Entities as Transparent or Opaque

### 1. From Recognition to Characterisation

While recognition addresses whether a foreign entity exists as a legal person, characterisation asks a different question: assuming the entity exists, how should it be treated for tax purposes? Specifically, should the entity itself be taxed on its income, or should the entity be disregarded with its members taxed directly on their share of entity income?

This is fundamentally a tax law question rather than a private international law question. A state may fully recognise a foreign partnership as a valid legal entity capable of owning property and entering contracts while simultaneously treating it as transparent for tax purposes—looking through the entity to tax the partners directly on partnership income as it arises. The legal existence of the entity and its tax treatment operate on different planes.

Understanding entity characterisation matters because the same entity may be treated differently by different states. One jurisdiction may view an entity as transparent while another treats it as opaque. These characterisation conflicts create the foundation for hybrid mismatch arrangements that have attracted significant regulatory attention under the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative.

### 2. The Core Distinction: Transparent Versus Opaque

#### 2.1. Tax Treatment Differences

An opaque entity—also called a non-transparent or fiscally opaque entity—is treated as a separate taxpayer. The entity itself is subject to tax on its income. When the entity distributes profits to its owners, those distributions constitute a separate taxable event, typically characterised as dividends. The entity and its owners are treated as distinct taxpayers with separate tax obligations.

A transparent entity—also called a flow-through, pass-through, or fiscally transparent entity—is not treated as a separate taxpayer. Instead, the entity's income, deductions, and credits flow through to its members, who include those items in their own tax calculations. No entity-level tax applies; all taxation occurs at the member level. When the entity distributes funds to members, no further taxation arises because the income has already been taxed in the members' hands.

#### 2.2. Consequences for International Taxation

The distinction produces significant differences across multiple dimensions. For income taxation, opaque entities pay tax at the entity level with members facing additional tax on distributions, while transparent entity income is taxed once at the member level. For loss utilisation, losses remain trapped within opaque entities and cannot offset owner income, while transparent entity losses flow through to members who may use them against other income. For treaty access, opaque entities may qualify as treaty residents in their own right, while transparent entities typically cannot claim treaty benefits—only their members may do so.

These differences explain why entity characterisation has become central to international tax planning and why characterisation mismatches between jurisdictions create both planning opportunities and policy concerns.

### 3. State Practice in Entity Characterisation

#### 3.1. The United States Check-the-Box Regime

The United States operates perhaps the most flexible entity classification system globally through its check-the-box regulations under Treasury Regulations sections 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3, effective since 1997. These regulations allow certain entities to elect their tax classification by filing Form 8832 with the Internal Revenue Service.

The system distinguishes between per se corporations, which are automatically classified as corporations regardless of election, and eligible entities, which may choose their classification. Per se corporations include specified entity types from various jurisdictions—Aktiengesellschaft from Germany, Société Anonyme from France, Public Limited Company from the United Kingdom—that possess characteristics making them inherently corporate. These entities cannot elect different treatment.

Eligible entities may elect classification as either corporations or partnerships. Single-owner eligible entities may elect to be disregarded entirely, treating all assets and liabilities as belonging directly to the owner. Default rules apply where no election is made: domestic entities with two or more owners default to partnership treatment; single-owner domestic entities default to disregarded status; foreign entities default based on whether members have limited liability.

The elective nature of check-the-box creates opportunities for hybrid structures. A foreign entity might be classified as a corporation under local law but elect partnership treatment for US purposes, or vice versa. This flexibility, while simplifying domestic classification questions, generates the cross-border characterisation conflicts that produce hybrid mismatches.

#### 3.2. United Kingdom: Following Legal Form

The United Kingdom traditionally follows a legal form approach to entity characterisation. Whether an entity is transparent or opaque depends primarily on its legal structure under UK law or, for foreign entities, its characteristics when analysed against UK concepts.

Limited companies incorporated under UK law are opaque—they constitute separate taxpayers subject to corporation tax. General partnerships are transparent—partners are taxed individually on their share of partnership profits. The Scottish partnership presents an interesting case: it possesses separate legal personality under Scottish law yet remains fiscally transparent, demonstrating that legal personality and tax transparency can coexist.

UK Limited Liability Partnerships exemplify this separation of legal and tax treatment. An LLP is a body corporate with separate legal personality—it can own property, sue, and be sued. Yet for tax purposes it is treated as transparent, with members taxed on their share of LLP profits as if the LLP structure did not exist. *(covered in June 2022)*

For foreign entities, the UK applies a comparative analysis, examining whether the foreign entity more closely resembles a UK company or a UK partnership based on its characteristics. Factors include whether the entity has separate legal personality, whether member liability is limited, and how the entity is governed.

#### 3.3. Germany: The Structural Approach

Germany characterises entities based on their structural similarity to German entity types, applying detailed comparison criteria including centralised management structure, limited liability of members, free transferability of interests, continuity of existence independent of member changes, and the ability to distribute profits.

An entity exhibiting corporate characteristics—limited liability, centralised management, freely transferable ownership interests—is typically treated as opaque. Partnership-like entities lacking these characteristics are treated as transparent. German limited partnerships such as the Kommanditgesellschaft are transparent, while the Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung is opaque.

This structural approach can produce different results than the US check-the-box system for the same entity. A German KG viewed from the US might be classified as a corporation under check-the-box defaults if all members have limited liability, while Germany treats it as transparent. Such differences create the conditions for hybrid mismatches.

### 4. Hybrid Entities and Mismatches

#### 4.1. What Creates a Hybrid Entity

A hybrid entity arises when the same legal arrangement receives different characterisation in two or more jurisdictions. The hybrid quality is not inherent to the entity itself but results from how different states perceive it.

Consider a Delaware LLC owned by a UK parent company. Under US check-the-box defaults, the LLC may be treated as transparent, with income flowing through to the UK parent for US tax purposes. The UK, however, may view the LLC as opaque based on its corporate characteristics—limited liability, centralised management, transferable interests. From the US perspective, income has already been attributed to the UK parent; from the UK perspective, the LLC is a separate entity whose income is not taxed until distributed.

This characterisation conflict can produce double non-taxation. The US sees income as flowing to the UK parent and imposes no US tax at the LLC level. The UK sees the LLC as opaque and imposes no UK tax until dividend distribution. Income escapes taxation in both jurisdictions.

#### 4.2. Types of Hybrid Mismatches

The OECD's BEPS Action 2 identifies several categories of hybrid mismatches arising from entity characterisation differences.

Deduction without inclusion outcomes occur when a payment is deductible in the payer jurisdiction but not included in income in the payee jurisdiction. This commonly arises where the payer jurisdiction treats the recipient entity as opaque—allowing deduction for interest paid to a separate entity—while the payee jurisdiction treats the recipient as transparent and the ultimate owner is exempt or otherwise not taxed on the receipt.

Double deduction outcomes occur when the same expense is deducted in two jurisdictions. This can arise with hybrid entities where both the entity jurisdiction and the owner jurisdiction permit deduction of the same payment, perhaps because each jurisdiction treats the entity differently and applies its deduction rules accordingly. *(covered in December 2024)*

#### 4.3. Reverse Hybrids

A reverse hybrid is the mirror image of a standard hybrid: an entity treated as opaque in its jurisdiction of establishment but transparent in the investor's jurisdiction.

Consider a German KG with a US corporate investor. Germany treats the KG as transparent—a partnership whose income is attributed to its partners. The US investor, however, may treat the KG as opaque under check-the-box rules if the KG is classified as a foreign corporation. Germany attributes income to the US partner and expects that partner to pay tax; the US sees a separate foreign corporation whose income is not currently taxable to the US shareholder.

Reverse hybrids can produce similar double non-taxation outcomes. Germany imposes no entity-level tax, expecting the US investor to be taxed on attributed income. The US imposes no tax, treating the German KG as a separate corporation not currently distributing dividends. The income escapes both jurisdictions.

### 5. Treaty Application and Transparent Entities

#### 5.1. Article 1(2) of the OECD Model

The 2017 OECD Model Tax Convention added Article 1(2) specifically to address fiscally transparent entities. The provision states that income derived by or through an entity treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered income of a resident of a Contracting State, but only to the extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income of a resident of that State.

This provision clarifies that transparent entity treatment does not preclude treaty benefits. When an entity is transparent, its income flows through to its members. Those members, if they are residents of a Contracting State who are taxed on the income, may claim treaty benefits in respect of that income. The transparent entity itself need not be a treaty resident; its members claim benefits directly.

Article 1(2) resolves uncertainty about whether income derived through a transparent entity qualifies for treaty protection. Without this provision, questions arose about whether the income was truly derived by the member or whether the interposition of the entity disrupted the connection between the member and the income.

#### 5.2. The Liable to Tax Connection

Article 4(1) of the OECD Model requires a person to be liable to tax by reason of domicile, residence, or similar criterion to qualify as a resident. Transparent entities raise a fundamental question: is a transparent entity liable to tax when it pays no tax itself?

The answer distinguishes between liable to tax and subject to tax. Liable to tax means falling within the scope of the taxing jurisdiction—being a person to whom the tax law applies. Subject to tax means actually bearing a tax burden after applying exemptions, deductions, and allowances. A person can be liable to tax without being subject to tax if, for example, losses eliminate taxable income or exemptions apply to particular income types.

For transparent entities, the partners or members are liable to tax on partnership income even though the partnership itself is not a taxpayer. The members fall within the taxing jurisdiction; the partnership income is attributed to them and included in their tax calculations. Article 1(2) confirms that these members may claim treaty benefits as residents who are liable to tax on the income in question.

### 6. BEPS Action 2: Neutralising Hybrid Mismatches

#### 6.1. The Linking Rules Approach

BEPS Action 2 implements linking rules that connect the tax treatment in one jurisdiction to the treatment in another, neutralising hybrid mismatches without requiring harmonisation of classification rules.

For deduction without inclusion outcomes, the primary rule applies in the payer jurisdiction and denies the deduction if the corresponding payment is not included in the payee jurisdiction's tax base due to hybrid mismatch. If the payer jurisdiction does not apply the primary rule, a defensive rule applies in the payee jurisdiction requiring inclusion of the payment that would otherwise escape taxation.

For double deduction outcomes, the primary rule applies in the parent jurisdiction, denying deduction to the extent the same expense is also deducted in the subsidiary jurisdiction. The defensive rule applies in the subsidiary jurisdiction if the parent jurisdiction fails to act.

The rule hierarchy ensures that only one jurisdiction adjusts, preventing both the primary and defensive rules from applying simultaneously—which would convert double non-taxation into double taxation. This ordering requires information exchange between jurisdictions, as each must know whether the other has acted before determining its own response.

#### 6.2. Implementation

Major jurisdictions have implemented BEPS Action 2 recommendations. The United Kingdom introduced comprehensive hybrid mismatch rules effective from January 2017. European Union member states implemented rules through the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, with most provisions taking effect by 2020. Australia, Canada, and other jurisdictions have followed.

The linking rules approach preserves domestic sovereignty over classification decisions. States need not harmonise their rules on whether particular entities are transparent or opaque. Instead, they adjust the tax consequences when classification differences produce unintended double non-taxation, addressing revenue concerns without requiring global agreement on uniform classification.
