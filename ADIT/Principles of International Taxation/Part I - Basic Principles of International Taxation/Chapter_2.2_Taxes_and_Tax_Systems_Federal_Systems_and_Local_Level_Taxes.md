## 1. Concept Foundation

### 1.1. Federal vs. Unitary Systems

Countries organize their tax systems based on their constitutional structure:

| System | Characteristics | Examples |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Federal** | Multiple levels of government with independent taxing powers | USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, India, Brazil |
| **Unitary** | Single central government holds primary taxing authority | UK, France, Japan, Italy, New Zealand |
| **Quasi-Federal** | Constitutionally unitary but highly decentralized | Spain, Colombia |

### 1.2. Key Statistics (OECD 2023 Data)

**Federal Countries (8 OECD members)**:
| Government Level | Average Revenue Share |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Central government | 53.1% |
| Social security funds | 21.5% |
| State/regional level | 17.6% |
| Local level | 7.5% |

**Unitary Countries (28 OECD members)**:
| Government Level | Average Revenue Share |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Central government | 64.8% |
| Social security funds | 25.0% |
| Local level | 9.8% |

**Range of Variation**:
- Central government share: 29.9% (France) to 93.5% (New Zealand)
- Local government share: 0.6% (Estonia) to 35.7% (Sweden)

### 1.3. Fiscal Federalism: The Theory

**Definition**: Fiscal federalism is an economic framework for understanding the division of spending and taxing powers among different levels of government.

**Core Principles** (Richard Musgrave, 1959):

| Government Function | Best Level | Rationale |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Stabilization** | Federal/Central | Only national government large enough to affect overall economic activity |
| **Redistribution** | Federal/Central | Prevents "race to the bottom" in welfare provision |
| **Allocation** | State/Local | Better knowledge of local preferences and needs |

**Tax Assignment Principles**:

| Tax Type | Recommended Level | Reasoning |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Taxes on mobile bases (capital, corporate income) | Central | Prevent tax competition, base flight |
| Taxes on less mobile bases (property, sales) | State/Local | Geographic connection to services |
| Personal income tax | Shared | Can work at multiple levels |

#### The Race to the Bottom Debate

A central concern in fiscal federalism is whether decentralised taxation leads to destructive tax competition:

**The Race to the Bottom Thesis**:
Subnational governments competing for mobile capital may engage in successive tax cuts, ultimately:
- Eroding tax revenues across all jurisdictions
- Underfunding public services
- Shifting tax burden to immobile factors (labour, property)

**Counter-Arguments**:
Critics argue the "race to the bottom" is overstated:
1. **Tiebout sorting**: Competition allows citizens to choose jurisdictions matching their service/tax preferences
2. **Efficiency gains**: Competition disciplines governments from excessive taxation
3. **Empirical evidence**: Many high-tax jurisdictions maintain competitive economies (Nordic countries, California, New York)

**The International Dimension**:
This debate directly parallels international discussions on corporate tax competition that led to Pillar Two. The 15% global minimum tax represents a floor preventing the race from continuing indefinitely. Similar arguments apply to subnational taxation - many federal systems have mechanisms to prevent internal tax wars.

**Coordination Mechanisms**:

| Country | Mechanism | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Germany | Revenue sharing formulas | Equalisation between states |
| Canada | Tax Collection Agreements | Harmonised provincial bases |
| USA | None (limited coordination) | Significant state variation |
| Australia | GST distribution | Federal collection, state allocation |

### 1.4. Levels of Government and Their Taxes

#### Federal/Central Government

| Typical Taxes | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Personal income tax | Progressive rates, broad base |
| Corporate income tax | Uniform rate nationwide |
| VAT/GST | National consumption tax |
| Customs duties | Border levies |
| Social security taxes | Earmarked for specific programs |

#### State/Regional Government

| Typical Taxes | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| State income tax | May piggyback on federal base |
| State sales tax | Rates vary by state |
| State corporate tax | May differ from federal |
| Motor vehicle taxes | Registration, fuel |

#### Local/Municipal Government

| Typical Taxes | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Property tax | Primary local revenue source |
| Local income tax | Limited adoption |
| Business license taxes | Local business taxes |
| User fees | Service-specific charges |

### 1.5. Country Examples

#### United States

```
Federal Level (IRS):
• Personal income tax: 10-37% progressive
• Corporate income tax: 21% flat
• Payroll taxes: Social Security, Medicare
• No VAT/national sales tax

State Level (50 states):
• State income tax: 0% (9 states) to 13.3% (California)
• State sales tax: 0% (5 states) to 7.25% (California)
• State corporate tax: 0% (6 states) to 11.5% (New Jersey)

Local Level (thousands of jurisdictions):
• Property tax: Primary source (average ~1% of value)
• Local income tax: 16 states allow
• Local sales tax: Additional to state tax
```

**Note on DTCs**: U.S. tax treaties generally **exclude** state and local taxes from coverage (except for non-discrimination provisions).

## 2. Treaty Coverage of Subnational Taxes

### Article 2(1) OECD Model Tax Convention

> "This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and on capital imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of **its political subdivisions or local authorities**, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied."

**Key Points**:
- DTCs cover taxes at **all levels** of government (federal, state, local)
- Applies regardless of collection method
- Covers "political subdivisions" (states, provinces, regions)
- Covers "local authorities" (municipalities, counties)

### Treatment Varies by Country

| Country | Treaty Treatment of Subnational Taxes |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| **Most countries** | Subnational income taxes covered by DTC |
| **United States** | State/local taxes generally **excluded** (except non-discrimination) |
| **Switzerland** | Cantonal taxes covered |
| **Germany** | State share of taxes covered |

### U.S. Model Convention Approach

The U.S. Model Tax Convention takes a unique position:

> "Except with respect to Article 24 (Nondiscrimination), state and local taxes in the United States are not covered by the Convention."

**Implications**:
- State income taxes are NOT reduced by U.S. DTCs
- Non-residents may face both federal AND state tax
- Non-discrimination protection still applies at state level
- Creates complexity for international taxpayers

#### The Policy Debate: Should Subnational Taxes Be Treaty-Covered?

The divergence between the OECD approach (include subnational taxes) and U.S. approach (exclude state taxes) reflects genuine policy tensions:

**Arguments for Including Subnational Taxes**:
1. **Comprehensive relief**: International taxpayers face combined burden; partial relief is inadequate
2. **Constitutional basis**: Federal government typically has treaty-making power
3. **Administrative simplicity**: Single point of coordination for foreign taxpayers
4. **Fairness**: Domestic taxpayers don't face layered taxation in the same way

**Arguments for Excluding Subnational Taxes (U.S. Position)**:
1. **Federalism**: States are sovereign within their sphere; federal government shouldn't bind them in treaties
2. **Revenue protection**: States need their tax bases; cannot be overridden by federal action
3. **Complexity**: Different states have different taxes; hard to address comprehensively
4. **Practical enforceability**: Federal government cannot compel state compliance

**International Pressure**: The U.S. exclusion of state taxes has been criticised by treaty partners. Some countries have negotiated specific provisions addressing state taxes in U.S. treaties, though with limited success.

**Practical Workaround**: Many U.S. states allow credits for foreign taxes paid, providing unilateral relief even absent treaty coverage. Additionally, the non-discrimination provisions (applicable to state taxes) prevent the most egregious forms of discrimination against foreigners.

## 3. International Tax Implications

### 3.1. Multiple Layers of Double Taxation

In federal systems, international taxpayers may face:

```
Example: Non-resident earning income in USA

Federal Level:
• U.S. federal income tax (potentially reduced by DTC)

State Level:
• State income tax (NOT covered by DTC)
• Rates: 0% to 13.3%

Result: Even with DTC relief, state tax may still apply
```

### 3.2. Residence Determination Complexity

Different government levels may have different residence rules:

| Level | Residence Test | Issue |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Federal | 183-day rule, green card | National standard |
| State | Varies widely | Domicile, statutory residence, source rules |
| Local | Physical presence | May trigger local tax |

### 3.3. Compliance Burden

Federal systems create additional compliance requirements:

| Compliance Area | Challenge |
|----------------|-----------|
| Filing requirements | Multiple returns at different levels |
| Tax rates | Must track rates for each jurisdiction |
| Tax base | May differ between federal and state |
| Credits/deductions | May not align across levels |
| Withholding | May be required at multiple levels |

### 3.4. Transfer Pricing

Subnational transfer pricing issues arise when:
- States have their own transfer pricing rules
- Arm's length requirement applies at state level
- State may not follow federal adjustments

#### Case Study: Transfer Pricing in Federal Systems

The interaction between federal and subnational transfer pricing rules creates unique challenges:

**U.S. State Transfer Pricing**:
- Most states follow federal transfer pricing rules by reference (IRC §482)
- HOWEVER, states may not accept IRS adjustments automatically
- Some states have separate administrative processes
- APAs (Advance Pricing Agreements) with IRS may not bind states

**Germany's Approach**:
- Trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) is municipal but uses federal profit calculation
- Federal transfer pricing adjustments automatically affect trade tax
- Creates coherence but can amplify adjustment effects

**Canada's Provincial Coordination**:
- Federal transfer pricing rules in ITA §247 apply consistently
- Provinces generally follow federal income allocation
- Transfer pricing adjustments flow through to provincial tax

**Practical Implications for MNEs**:

| Issue | Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Multiple audits | Different jurisdictions may audit same transaction | Document comprehensively from outset |
| Inconsistent outcomes | State may reach different conclusion than federal | Seek coordinated review where possible |
| Compliance burden | Multiple reporting requirements | Centralise documentation |
| Dispute resolution | MAP at federal level may not bind states | Consider state-specific resolution |

**Link to Pillar Two**: The GloBE rules introduce additional complexity - the top-up tax calculation requires determining "covered taxes" which may include certain subnational taxes. Understanding which subnational taxes qualify as "covered" becomes crucial for effective tax rate calculations.

## 4. Practical Considerations

### For Individual Taxpayers

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| **Residence changes** | May trigger state exit taxes |
| **Multi-state income** | Apportionment rules vary |
| **Credits for taxes paid** | State may credit other state taxes |
| **Treaty benefits** | May not apply to state/local taxes |

### For Corporate Taxpayers

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| **Nexus rules** | Each state has different thresholds |
| **Apportionment formulas** | Sales, payroll, property factors |
| **Unitary taxation** | Some states tax worldwide combined income |
| **Permanent establishment** | State rules may differ from federal |

### For Tax Authorities

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| **Information exchange** | May not cover subnational taxes |
| **Administrative assistance** | Limited to treaty-covered taxes |
| **Competent authority** | Usually federal-level only |
