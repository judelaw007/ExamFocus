# Chapter 2.2: Taxes and Tax Systems - Federal Systems and Local-Level Taxes

## 2.2.1. The Multi-Level Structure of Taxation

The constitutional structure of a country determines how taxing powers are distributed among different levels of government. This distribution has significant implications for international taxation, particularly regarding treaty coverage, compliance obligations, and the potential for multiple layers of taxation on cross-border activities.

### 2.2.1.1. Federal Versus Unitary Systems

Countries organise their governmental structures in fundamentally different ways. **Federal systems** divide sovereignty between a central government and constituent units (states, provinces, cantons, or Länder), each possessing independent legislative and taxing powers. Examples include the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, India, and Brazil. In contrast, **unitary systems** concentrate taxing authority in the central government, which may delegate limited powers to local authorities. The United Kingdom, France, Japan, and New Zealand operate as unitary states.

Some countries occupy an intermediate position. Spain and Colombia, while constitutionally unitary, have devolved substantial taxing powers to autonomous regions, creating quasi-federal arrangements in practice.

### 2.2.1.2. Fiscal Federalism Theory

The economic framework underpinning tax allocation across government levels draws on the work of economist Richard Musgrave. His analysis identified three governmental functions and their optimal assignment:

**Stabilisation** (managing economic cycles) belongs at the central level, as only the national government possesses sufficient scale to affect overall economic activity. **Redistribution** (addressing inequality) similarly requires central coordination to prevent a destructive competition in which jurisdictions reduce welfare provision to avoid attracting benefit recipients. **Allocation** (providing public services), however, may be more efficiently performed at state or local levels, where governments possess better knowledge of local preferences.

These principles inform tax assignment. Taxes on mobile bases such as capital and corporate income are typically assigned to central governments to prevent base flight, while taxes on less mobile bases (property, local consumption) suit subnational levels due to their geographic connection to local services.

## 2.2.2. Typical Tax Assignments by Level

### 2.2.2.1. Central Government Taxes

Central governments typically impose taxes requiring uniform application across the national economy. Personal income tax forms the largest revenue source in most developed countries, often with progressive rate structures. Corporate income tax applies a uniform national rate to business profits. Value-added tax or goods and services tax provides consumption-based revenue. Customs duties and excise taxes on specific goods (tobacco, alcohol, fuel) complete the typical federal portfolio.

### 2.2.2.2. State and Regional Taxes

State-level taxation varies significantly across federal countries. The United States permits states to impose separate income taxes (ranging from 0% in nine states to 13.3% in California), state sales taxes, and corporate taxes. Canadian provinces levy provincial income taxes and, in most cases, participate in harmonised sales tax arrangements with the federal government. German Länder receive shared revenue from federal taxes and impose inheritance and real property transfer taxes.

### 2.2.2.3. Local and Municipal Taxes

Local governments rely primarily on property taxation, which provides a stable revenue base connected to immovable assets within municipal boundaries. Germany's Gewerbesteuer (trade tax) represents an unusual local business tax that significantly contributes to municipal revenue. Some jurisdictions permit local income taxes—sixteen American states authorise municipalities to impose them, most notably New York City's additional resident income tax.

## 2.2.3. Treaty Coverage of Subnational Taxes

### 2.2.3.1. The OECD Model Approach

Article 2(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention extends treaty coverage to taxes "imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local authorities." This broad formulation encompasses subnational taxes, providing comprehensive double taxation relief regardless of which government level imposes the tax.

Most countries follow this approach. German trade tax, Swiss cantonal and communal taxes, and Canadian provincial taxes all fall within the scope of their respective treaties.

### 2.2.3.2. The United States Exception

The United States takes a distinctive position. The U.S. Model Tax Convention explicitly excludes state and local taxes from treaty coverage, except for non-discrimination provisions under Article 24. This reflects federalism concerns—the federal government lacks constitutional authority to bind states in matters within their sovereign sphere.

The practical consequence is significant: non-residents earning U.S.-source income may obtain federal tax relief under an applicable treaty while remaining fully liable for state income tax. A German company with a California presence faces 21% federal corporate tax (potentially reduced by treaty) plus 8.84% California franchise tax with no treaty relief.

### 2.2.3.3. Policy Considerations

This divergence reflects genuine tensions. Proponents of comprehensive coverage argue that international taxpayers face combined burdens requiring integrated relief, and that administrative simplicity favours single-point coordination. Those supporting the U.S. approach emphasise state sovereignty, revenue protection, and the practical difficulty of addressing diverse state tax systems in bilateral instruments.

## 2.2.4. Compliance Implications

### 2.2.4.1. Multiple Filing Requirements

Federal systems impose significant compliance burdens. A corporation operating in multiple U.S. states must file separate returns in each jurisdiction, applying different apportionment formulas to allocate income among states. The formula components (sales, payroll, property) and their weighting vary by state, requiring sophisticated tracking systems.

### 2.2.4.2. Residence and Nexus Determination

Different government levels may apply different tests to establish taxing rights. Federal residence rules may differ from state domicile concepts; local presence thresholds may create tax obligations absent at higher levels. In the United States, the physical presence standard for state sales tax nexus was abandoned following the Supreme Court's 2018 decision in *South Dakota v. Wayfair*, permitting states to assert jurisdiction based on economic activity alone.

### 2.2.4.3. Transfer Pricing Considerations

While most states follow federal transfer pricing rules by reference, they may not automatically accept federal audit adjustments. Advance Pricing Agreements concluded with the Internal Revenue Service do not bind state tax authorities, potentially leaving transfer pricing disputes unresolved at the subnational level.

## 2.2.5. The International Dimension

Understanding subnational taxation matters for international tax practice. Article 2(3) of bilateral treaties typically lists covered taxes, including relevant subnational levies. The UK-Germany treaty, for example, explicitly covers Gewerbesteuer. Determining whether specific subnational taxes fall within treaty scope requires careful examination of both the treaty text and the characterisation of the tax under domestic law.

The OECD/G20 Pillar Two rules add further complexity. Calculating the effective tax rate for Global Anti-Base Erosion purposes requires identifying "covered taxes," which may include qualifying subnational taxes. Understanding which local taxes qualify becomes essential for multinational enterprises assessing their exposure to top-up taxation.
