## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION

### 1. What Is Citizenship-Based Taxation?

**Definition**: Citizenship-based taxation (CBT) imposes tax liability on individuals based on their citizenship or nationality, **regardless of where they live or where their income is earned**.

**Key Distinction**:

| Tax System | Basis for Tax | Who Is Taxed on Worldwide Income |
|------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Residence-based** | Where you live | Residents only |
| **Territorial** | Where income arises | No one (only source income taxed) |
| **Citizenship-based** | Nationality | All citizens, regardless of residence |

### 2. Countries Using Citizenship-Based Taxation

Only **two countries** in the world tax based on citizenship:

| Country | System | Key Features |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **United States** | Full CBT | Citizens taxed on worldwide income at normal rates |
| **Eritrea** | Diaspora tax | 2% flat tax on citizens abroad (limited enforcement) |

**Every other country** uses residence-based or territorial taxation. Citizenship is irrelevant for tax purposes in the UK, Germany, France, and virtually all other jurisdictions.

---

## B. THE US SYSTEM: HOW IT WORKS

### 1. Who Is Subject to US CBT?

**US "tax persons"** subject to worldwide US taxation:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **US Citizens** | Anyone with US citizenship, including dual citizens |
| **Green Card Holders** | Lawful permanent residents |
| **Substantial Presence** | Non-citizens meeting the 183-day SPT test |

**Critical Point**: A US citizen living abroad for 30 years, earning only foreign income, with no US assets, must still file US tax returns and potentially pay US tax.

### 2. US Filing Requirements for Citizens Abroad

| Requirement | Threshold | Form |
|-------------|-----------|------|
| **Tax Return** | Income exceeds filing threshold (~$14,600 single, 2024) | Form 1040 |
| **FBAR** | Foreign accounts >$10,000 aggregate at any time | FinCEN 114 |
| **FATCA** | Foreign financial assets >$200,000 (single abroad) | Form 8938 |
| **Foreign Corporations** | Own >10% of foreign corporation | Form 5471 |
| **Foreign Trusts** | Beneficiary/transferor to foreign trust | Forms 3520/3520-A |

### 3. Relief Mechanisms

The US provides relief to prevent double taxation:

#### Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Amount (2024)** | Up to $126,500 excludable |
| **Qualification** | Physical Presence Test (330 days abroad) OR Bona Fide Residence Test |
| **Scope** | Only **earned income** (wages, self-employment) |
| **Exclusions** | Does NOT apply to passive income, pensions, Social Security |
| **Form** | Form 2555 |

#### Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Mechanism** | Dollar-for-dollar credit for foreign taxes paid |
| **Limitation** | Credit limited to US tax on foreign-source income |
| **Carryover** | Excess credits can be carried back 1 year, forward 10 years |
| **Form** | Form 1116 |

**Choice Between FEIE and FTC**:
- **FEIE**: Better when foreign tax rate < US rate (excludes income entirely)
- **FTC**: Better when foreign tax rate > US rate (credit eliminates US tax)
- Can use both for different income types

## C. THE TREATY SAVING CLAUSE

### 1. What Is the Saving Clause?

The **saving clause** in US tax treaties preserves the US right to tax its citizens and residents as if the treaty did not exist.

**Standard US Treaty Saving Clause Language**:
> "This Convention shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its residents (as determined under Article 4) and its citizens."

### 2. Effect of the Saving Clause

**Without Saving Clause**:
- Treaty allocates taxing rights between states
- US citizens could use treaty to reduce US tax on foreign income

**With Saving Clause**:
- US retains full right to tax its citizens
- Most treaty benefits unavailable to US citizens
- Treaty primarily benefits **foreign persons** earning US income

**Example**:
```
US CITIZEN WORKING IN UK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Without Saving Clause:
  UK employment income taxable only in UK (Article 15)
  US would provide exemption

With Saving Clause (Reality):
  UK taxes employment income (source)
  US ALSO taxes employment income (citizenship)
  US must provide relief via FTC (not exemption)
```

### 3. Exceptions to the Saving Clause

Most US treaties list specific articles **exempt** from the saving clause:

| Common Exceptions | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Pensions (some treaties)** | May reduce US tax on foreign pensions |
| **Students/Trainees** | May provide tax exemption |
| **Non-Discrimination** | US citizens can't be treated worse |
| **Relief from Double Taxation** | FTC provisions apply |
| **MAP** | Competent authority assistance available |

---

## D. IMPLICATIONS AND PROBLEMS

### 1. Double Taxation Exposure

US citizens abroad face potential **triple taxation**:

```
TRIPLE TAX SCENARIO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Layer 1: Source State (where income earned)
Layer 2: Residence State (where living)
Layer 3: Citizenship State (USA)

Example: US citizen resident in Germany earning French income
  France (source): WHT on French dividends
  Germany (residence): Income tax on worldwide income
  USA (citizenship): Income tax on worldwide income

Must coordinate 3 countries' taxes via credits
```

### 2. Compliance Burden

**Annual US Filing Requirements** for citizens abroad:
- Tax return (even if no US tax owed)
- FBAR (if foreign accounts >$10,000)
- FATCA Form 8938 (if substantial foreign assets)
- Various information returns (foreign companies, trusts, gifts)

**Penalties for Non-Compliance**:

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Failure to file FBAR | $10,000-$100,000+ per violation |
| FATCA non-filing | $10,000+ per form |
| Willful violations | Criminal penalties possible |

### 3. Banking Access Challenges

**FATCA's Impact on US Citizens Abroad**:
- Foreign banks must report US account holders to IRS
- Many foreign banks refuse to open accounts for US persons
- Compliance costs lead to "de-banking" of Americans abroad
- Some Americans renounce citizenship due to banking difficulties

### 4. Renunciation Considerations

US citizens considering renunciation face:

| Issue | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Exit Tax** | Mark-to-market on unrealized gains (covered expatriates) |
| **Covered Expatriate** | Net worth >$2M OR average tax liability >$190,000 (2024) |
| **Tax Compliance** | Must certify 5 years tax compliance |
| **Administrative** | State Department fee of $2,350 |

## E. HISTORICAL AND POLICY CONTEXT

### Historical Origins of US Citizenship-Based Taxation

The US adopted citizenship-based taxation during the **Civil War (1861)** when Congress was concerned that wealthy Americans would move abroad to avoid financing the war effort. The policy was intended as a temporary wartime measure but was never repealed.

**Key Historical Points**:
- 1861: First US income tax included citizenship provision
- 1894: Income tax struck down but CBT concept established
- 1913: 16th Amendment enables permanent income tax, CBT continued
- 1962: Kennedy administration expanded foreign income reporting
- 2010: FATCA enacted, dramatically increasing enforcement

### The International Outlier Position

The US position is increasingly criticized internationally:

**Arguments Against CBT**:
1. **Violates residence principle**: Tax should follow where benefits received
2. **Unfair burden**: Citizens abroad don't use US public services
3. **Compliance impossibility**: Complex rules create inadvertent non-compliance
4. **Banking discrimination**: FATCA causes foreign banks to reject US persons
5. **Affects "accidental Americans"**: Born in US but left as infants

**US Government Defense**:
1. **Revenue protection**: Prevents tax-motivated emigration
2. **Benefits of citizenship**: US passport, consular services, political rights
3. **Equity argument**: US citizens shouldn't avoid tax by moving
4. **Enforcement mechanism**: FATCA succeeds where voluntary compliance fails

### Policy Reform Discussions

Various reform proposals have been suggested:

| Proposal | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Residency-based reform** | Switch to residence-based taxation | Bills introduced but not passed |
| **Territorial for individuals** | Tax only US-source income | Discussed, no action |
| **Same country exception** | No US tax if paying full tax in high-tax country | Proposed |
| **FATCA reform** | Reduce reporting burden | Limited modifications |

### Practical Impact on International Structures

CBT affects international tax planning involving US persons:

**Investment Structures**: US citizens face different tax consequences than non-US persons for:
- Offshore funds (PFIC rules apply to US persons)
- Foreign companies (CFC rules more burdensome)
- Foreign trusts (complex reporting requirements)

**Multinational Families**: Mixed-citizenship families face planning challenges:
- Joint accounts trigger US reporting for non-US spouse
- Non-US children may become "accidental Americans" through birth
- Inheritance from US citizen has different implications

## F. EXAM APPLICATION

### When Citizenship-Based Taxation Is Relevant

Look for these triggers in exam questions:

| Trigger | Analysis Required |
|---------|-------------------|
| "US citizen" mentioned | Consider CBT implications |
| "Saving clause" referenced | Explain how it preserves US taxing right |
| "American living abroad" | Note FTC/FEIE relief mechanisms |
| "Dual citizen including US" | US retains taxing right regardless of residence |
| "Treaty benefits for US person" | Saving clause may block benefits |

### If Tested: Answer Structure

**For scenario involving US citizen abroad**:

1. **State the CBT rule** (2 marks)
   - US taxes citizens on worldwide income regardless of residence

2. **Explain treaty position** (3 marks)
   - Saving clause preserves US taxing right
   - Most treaty benefits unavailable to US citizens

3. **Identify relief mechanisms** (4 marks)
   - FEIE ($126,500 exclusion for 2024)
   - FTC (credit for foreign taxes paid)

4. **Apply to facts** (remaining marks)
   - Identify income types and applicable relief
   - Note compliance requirements
