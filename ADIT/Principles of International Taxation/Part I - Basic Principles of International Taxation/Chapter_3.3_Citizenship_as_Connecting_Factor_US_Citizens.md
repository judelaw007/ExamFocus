# Chapter 3.3: Implications of the Use of Citizenship as a Connecting Factor

## 1. Citizenship-Based Taxation as an Exception

Citizenship-based taxation imposes tax liability on individuals based on their nationality, regardless of where they reside or where their income originates. This approach stands in marked contrast to the residence-based systems employed by virtually all other countries, where tax liability attaches to the place a person lives rather than their formal legal status.

Only two countries in the world currently practice citizenship-based taxation. The **United States** operates a comprehensive system taxing citizens on worldwide income at full domestic rates. **Eritrea** imposes a more limited 2% diaspora tax on citizens abroad, though enforcement capacity remains constrained and collection typically occurs through consular services.

The overwhelming majority of states reject citizenship as a connecting factor for taxation. The prevailing international view holds that tax obligations should correspond to the jurisdiction where a person actually resides and benefits from public services. A person's nationality represents a formal legal status that may bear little relationship to their current circumstances—a citizen may have emigrated decades ago and maintain no meaningful connection with their country of nationality. Residence-based taxation better aligns tax obligations with the benefits received from government services and the ability of tax authorities to administer and enforce tax laws.

## 2. The United States System

### 2.1. Worldwide Taxation of Citizens

The United States taxes its citizens on worldwide income under the Internal Revenue Code. This obligation applies regardless of where citizens reside or where their income arises. A US citizen living abroad for decades, earning only foreign income, and maintaining no US assets remains subject to US tax on worldwide income throughout their life.

The US definition of taxable persons extends beyond citizens to include lawful permanent residents (green card holders) and individuals meeting the Substantial Presence Test based on physical presence in the United States. For citizenship-based taxation specifically, the obligation attaches at birth to anyone born in the United States or born abroad to US citizen parents meeting statutory requirements.

### 2.2. Filing and Compliance Requirements

US citizens abroad face substantial compliance obligations. Annual tax return filing is required regardless of whether any US tax is ultimately owed. Beyond the basic return, citizens must file the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) if foreign accounts exceed $10,000 in aggregate at any point during the year. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), enacted in 2010, requires disclosure of foreign financial assets exceeding specified thresholds on Form 8938.

Additional information returns apply to interests in foreign corporations, partnerships, and trusts. Failure to file these forms triggers substantial penalties—FBAR violations can result in penalties of $10,000 or more per account, with willful violations attracting significantly higher penalties and potential criminal prosecution.

### 2.3. Relief Mechanisms

The United States provides mechanisms to prevent double taxation of citizens abroad. The **Foreign Tax Credit** allows citizens to offset foreign taxes paid against US tax liability on foreign-source income. The credit is limited to the US tax attributable to foreign income, preventing foreign taxes from reducing US tax on domestic income. Excess credits may be carried back one year or forward ten years.

The **Foreign Earned Income Exclusion** permits qualifying citizens abroad to exclude a substantial portion of foreign earned income from US taxation—the amount exceeded $120,000 for recent tax years. Qualification requires either physical presence abroad for at least 330 days in a twelve-month period or establishment of bona fide residence in a foreign country. The exclusion applies only to earned income such as wages and self-employment income, not to passive income, pensions, or investment returns.

## 3. The Treaty Saving Clause

US tax treaties contain a distinctive provision known as the **saving clause** that preserves the United States' right to tax its citizens and residents as if the treaty did not exist. The typical formulation provides that the treaty "shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its residents and its citizens."

The practical effect is significant. Without the saving clause, treaty provisions allocating taxing rights exclusively to one contracting state would prevent the other state from taxing that income. A US citizen working in Germany might argue that Article 15 allocates taxing rights over employment income to Germany alone. The saving clause defeats this argument—the United States retains its citizenship-based taxing right regardless of treaty allocation provisions.

Most US treaties enumerate specific articles exempt from the saving clause, typically including non-discrimination, mutual agreement procedures, and certain provisions regarding students and trainees. However, the core distributive articles remain subject to the saving clause, meaning US citizens cannot use treaty provisions to escape US tax on foreign income.

## 4. Practical Implications and Criticisms

### 4.1. Compliance Challenges

US citizenship-based taxation creates significant practical difficulties. The FATCA regime requires foreign financial institutions to report accounts held by US persons or face withholding on US-source payments. Many foreign banks have responded by refusing to open accounts for US citizens, creating banking access difficulties for Americans abroad. This "de-banking" phenomenon has contributed to a significant increase in citizenship renunciations.

The system particularly affects "accidental Americans"—individuals born in the United States who left as infants and may be unaware of their citizenship status. Such persons face substantial compliance obligations and potential penalties despite having no meaningful connection to the United States.

### 4.2. Policy Debate

The United States position attracts substantial international criticism. Opponents argue that citizenship-based taxation violates the fundamental principle that tax should follow residence, imposes unfair burdens on citizens who derive minimal benefit from US government services, and creates impossible compliance requirements for individuals living ordinary lives abroad.

Defenders of the US approach point to revenue protection—preventing tax-motivated emigration by high-net-worth individuals—and the benefits citizenship provides, including consular protection and political rights. The equity argument suggests US citizens should not escape their share of taxation merely by relocating.

Article 24 of the OECD Model Tax Convention addresses non-discrimination based on nationality, prohibiting contracting states from treating nationals of the other state less favourably than their own nationals in similar circumstances (covered in December 2023). However, this provision protects foreign nationals from discrimination by the host state rather than limiting a state's taxation of its own nationals. Citizenship-based taxation by a state of its own citizens falls outside the scope of Article 24 protection.

Reform proposals—including conversion to residence-based taxation for individuals—have been introduced in Congress but have not progressed. The compliance burden, particularly FATCA's extraterritorial reach, continues to generate international diplomatic friction and advocacy from Americans abroad.
