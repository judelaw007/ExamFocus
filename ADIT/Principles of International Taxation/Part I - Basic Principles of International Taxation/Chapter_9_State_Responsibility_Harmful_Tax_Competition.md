## A. INTRODUCTION: STATE RESPONSIBILITY AND TAX COMPETITION

### 1. The Concept of Tax Competition

Tax competition refers to the use of tax policy by states to attract mobile capital, investment, or activities from other jurisdictions. This phenomenon has both positive and negative aspects:

| Aspect | Positive View | Negative View |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Economic** | Promotes efficiency; disciplines government spending | Race to the bottom; revenue erosion |
| **Sovereignty** | Reflects legitimate policy choice | Undermines other states' tax bases |
| **Investment** | Attracts foreign direct investment | Distorts allocation of capital |
| **Development** | Tool for developing countries | Benefits mobile capital over immobile factors |

### 2. When Does Tax Competition Become "Harmful"?

The key question is distinguishing **legitimate** tax competition from **harmful** tax practices:

```
TAX COMPETITION SPECTRUM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LEGITIMATE TAX COMPETITION           HARMFUL TAX PRACTICES
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  Low general       Preferential     Ring-fenced      Tax        │
│  tax rates         regimes with     regimes          havens     │
│                    substance        lacking          with no    │
│                                     transparency     substance  │
│                                                                 │
│  ← Generally       ← FHTP scrutiny → ← Harmful →               │
│    accepted                                                     │
│                                                                 │
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

KEY DISTINCTION:
• Low general tax rates ≠ harmful (legitimate sovereignty)
• Ring-fenced preferential regimes = potentially harmful
• No substance + no transparency = harmful
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. State Responsibility in Public International Law

Traditional public international law provides limited constraints on tax sovereignty. However, the concept of "harmful tax competition" represents an emerging norm of **state responsibility** in fiscal matters:

- States should not adopt practices that unduly erode other states' tax bases
- International cooperation required to address cross-border tax avoidance
- Soft law standards (OECD) have developed quasi-binding character through peer review

---

## B. THE 1998 OECD REPORT: FOUNDATION OF THE CONCEPT

### 1. Background and Context

The OECD's landmark report **"Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue"** (1998) was the first comprehensive international effort to address harmful tax practices.

**Driving factors:**
- Increased capital mobility in 1990s
- Growth of offshore financial centres
- Concerns about tax base erosion in OECD countries
- Recognition that unilateral measures insufficient

### 2. The Report's Two Categories

The 1998 Report distinguished between:

| Category | Definition | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Tax Havens** | Jurisdictions with no or nominal taxes offering themselves as places to escape tax | Traditional offshore centres |
| **Preferential Tax Regimes** | Regimes within otherwise normal tax systems that provide preferential treatment | Patent boxes, holding company regimes |

### 3. Original Tax Haven Criteria (1998)

The 1998 Report established four criteria for identifying tax havens:

```
1998 TAX HAVEN CRITERIA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Criterion 1: NO OR ONLY NOMINAL TAXES
             • The starting point
             • Not harmful in itself, but triggers other criteria

Criterion 2: LACK OF EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
             • Refusal to provide information to other tax authorities
             • Bank secrecy laws
             • Nominee arrangements

Criterion 3: LACK OF TRANSPARENCY
             • Non-transparent operation of legislative, legal or
               administrative provisions
             • Secret rulings
             • Negotiated tax rates

Criterion 4: NO SUBSTANTIAL ACTIVITIES REQUIREMENT
             • Tolerates "brass plate" companies
             • No real economic activity needed
             • NOTE: Withdrawn in 2001 after US objections

Post-2001: "Two of three" criteria (excluding Criterion 4)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4. Preferential Regime Criteria (1998)

For identifying harmful preferential regimes within OECD countries:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ring-fencing** | Regime isolated from domestic economy; benefits only non-residents or foreign income |
| **No substantial activity** | Benefits available without requirement for real presence |
| **Lack of transparency** | Preferential treatment negotiated or granted without clear criteria |
| **No information exchange** | Information on taxpayers not shared with other states |

---

## C. EVOLUTION: FROM 1998 TO BEPS

### 1. Early Challenges (1998-2006)

The 1998 initiative faced significant challenges:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **US position change (2001)** | Bush administration withdrew support for substance criterion |
| **Tax haven resistance** | Many jurisdictions challenged legitimacy of OECD standards |
| **Sovereignty arguments** | Small states argued discrimination |
| **Definition difficulties** | Distinguishing harmful from legitimate competition |

### 2. Shift to Transparency Focus (2000s)

After US objections, the FHTP shifted focus from tax rates to **transparency and information exchange**:

- Emphasis on exchange of information agreements
- Development of TIEA (Tax Information Exchange Agreement) model
- Global Forum on Transparency established (2000)
- Peer review of information exchange compliance

### 3. Reinvigoration Through BEPS (2013-2015)

The G20/OECD BEPS Project (Chapter 7.2) reinvigorated the harmful tax practices agenda:

**BEPS Action 5: Counter Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively**

This became one of the **four BEPS Minimum Standards**, meaning:
- All Inclusive Framework members must implement
- Subject to peer review
- Renewed focus on **substance** (not just transparency)

---

## D. BEPS ACTION 5: THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK

### 1. Two Main Workstreams

BEPS Action 5 established two parallel workstreams:

```
BEPS ACTION 5 STRUCTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                    BEPS ACTION 5
                    (Minimum Standard)
                          │
          ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
          │                               │
          ▼                               ▼
    WORKSTREAM 1:                   WORKSTREAM 2:
    PREFERENTIAL REGIMES            TRANSPARENCY

    • Review of IP regimes          • Spontaneous exchange of
    • Modified nexus approach         tax rulings
    • Substance requirements        • Rulings on preferential regimes
    • Non-IP regimes review         • Cross-border rulings
                                    • PE rulings
                                    • TP rulings

    OUTCOME: Regime assessment      OUTCOME: Rulings database
             (harmful/not harmful)           & exchange framework
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. The Modified Nexus Approach for IP Regimes

For IP regimes (patent boxes, innovation boxes), BEPS Action 5 introduced the **modified nexus approach**:

**Core principle:**
Tax benefits from IP income must be linked to the R&D expenditure incurred by the taxpayer that generated the IP.

**The Formula:**

```
              Qualifying Expenditure (+ 30% uplift)
Qualifying = ─────────────────────────────────────── × Overall IP Income
  Income            Overall Expenditure
```

**Where:**
- **Qualifying expenditure**: R&D costs incurred directly by taxpayer or unrelated parties
- **30% uplift**: Allows some credit for related-party or acquisition costs (up to 30% of qualifying expenditure)
- **Overall expenditure**: Total costs to develop IP (including acquisition, related-party costs)

```
EXAM TIP: Modified Nexus Approach
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The KEY POINT is that nexus approach uses EXPENDITURE as a
PROXY for substantial activity.

✓ You did the R&D yourself → Full benefit
✓ You outsourced to third party → Full benefit (arm's length)
✗ You acquired IP → Limited benefit (only via 30% uplift)
✗ Related-party R&D → Limited benefit (only via 30% uplift)

This ensures benefits go to entities with REAL R&D activities,
not those that merely acquire or hold IP.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Non-IP Preferential Regimes

For non-IP regimes (headquarters regimes, holding company regimes, financing regimes):

**General substantial activity requirement:**
- Must demonstrate genuine economic activity
- Core income-generating activities (CIGA) must be performed
- Personnel and facilities appropriate to activities

### 4. Transparency: Compulsory Spontaneous Exchange of Rulings

The transparency framework requires exchange of information on:

| Type of Ruling | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Rulings on preferential regimes** | Any ruling granting preferential treatment |
| **Cross-border unilateral APAs** | Transfer pricing rulings with cross-border effect |
| **Rulings on PE existence/attribution** | Rulings determining PE status or profit allocation |
| **Related-party conduit rulings** | Rulings involving conduit arrangements |
| **Other BEPS-relevant rulings** | Catch-all for other concerning rulings |

---

## E. THE FORUM ON HARMFUL TAX PRACTICES (FHTP)

### 1. Structure and Role

The **Forum on Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP)** is the OECD body responsible for implementing Action 5:

**Functions:**
- Reviews preferential tax regimes
- Monitors no/nominal tax jurisdictions
- Administers rulings exchange framework
- Conducts peer reviews
- Issues guidance on harmful practices

**Membership:**
- Open to Inclusive Framework members (145+ jurisdictions)
- Decisions by consensus
- Secretariat support from OECD

### 2. Current FHTP Work Programme

```
FHTP CURRENT WORKSTREAMS (2024-2025)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. PREFERENTIAL REGIME REVIEW
   • Assessment of new and amended regimes
   • Application of nexus approach (IP regimes)
   • Substance requirements (non-IP regimes)
   • Status: 332 regimes reviewed since BEPS started
   • Over 40% abolished or amended

2. NO/NOMINAL TAX JURISDICTION MONITORING
   • Annual review of 12 jurisdictions
   • Substantial activity requirements
   • Economic substance legislation compliance
   • Jurisdictions: Anguilla, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados,
     Bermuda, BVI, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man,
     Jersey, Turks & Caicos
   • Note: UAE removed (introduced 9% CIT in 2023)

3. TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK
   • Exchange of rulings between jurisdictions
   • Monitoring compliance with exchange obligations
   • Quality and timeliness of exchanges

4. PEER REVIEW
   • Annual peer review reports
   • Identification of areas for improvement
   • Focused monitoring for problem jurisdictions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Assessment Outcomes

Regimes are classified as:

| Classification | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Not harmful** | Meets nexus approach (IP) or substance requirements |
| **Harmful** | Does not meet requirements; must be abolished/amended |
| **In the process of being amended** | Transitional; jurisdiction committed to changes |
| **Under review** | Assessment ongoing |
| **Abolished** | Regime no longer exists |

---

## F. SUBSTANCE REQUIREMENTS IN NO/NOMINAL TAX JURISDICTIONS

### 1. Background

Following BEPS, attention turned to jurisdictions with **no or only nominal taxation**. Even without preferential regimes, these jurisdictions must demonstrate:
- Adequate substance for resident entities
- Economic activity requirements
- Compliance with international standards

### 2. Core Income-Generating Activities (CIGA)

Entities must undertake **core income-generating activities** in the jurisdiction:

| Activity Type | Required CIGA |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Headquarters** | Taking strategic decisions, coordinating group activities |
| **Holding company** | Making investment decisions, managing portfolio |
| **Distribution/service centres** | Purchasing, managing stock, distributing, logistics |
| **Finance/leasing** | Agreeing terms, managing risks, maintaining adequate capital |
| **IP holding** | Taking decisions on IP strategy, R&D direction |
| **Shipping** | Managing crew, maintaining vessels, supervising operations |

### 3. Implementation in Practice

Jurisdictions have enacted **economic substance legislation**:

**Common requirements:**
- Direction and management in jurisdiction
- Adequate employees with appropriate qualifications
- Adequate physical presence
- Core income-generating activities performed in jurisdiction
- Adequate expenditure proportionate to activities

---

## G. CHALLENGES AND CRITICISMS

### 1. Ongoing Challenges for FHTP

As noted in examiner guidance (December 2023 Q3), the FHTP faces significant challenges:

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Implementation consistency** | Ensuring all jurisdictions apply standards consistently |
| **Adaptive practices** | Tax planning evolves to circumvent rules |
| **Resource constraints** | Developing countries lack capacity to implement |
| **Political will** | Some jurisdictions benefit from preferential regimes |
| **Defining "harmful"** | Line between legitimate and harmful remains contested |
| **Digital economy** | New business models challenge traditional substance concepts |

### 2. Criticisms of the Framework

| Criticism | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **OECD-centric** | Inclusive Framework expanded participation |
| **Favours large countries** | Low rates ≠ harmful; substance focus neutral |
| **Limits development options** | Legitimate competition still permitted |
| **Soft law only** | Peer review creates accountability pressure |

### 3. Relationship with Pillar Two

The introduction of Pillar Two (Global Minimum Tax, 15% ETR) has implications for harmful tax competition:

- Pillar Two directly addresses low-taxed income
- May reduce importance of traditional FHTP work
- However, FHTP continues as complementary framework
- Substance requirements remain relevant even with minimum tax

---

## H. PRACTICAL APPLICATION

### 1. Identifying Potentially Harmful Features

When analysing a tax regime, consider:

```
HARMFUL TAX PRACTICE CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

□ Ring-fencing from domestic economy?
  • Benefits only for foreign income/non-residents?
  • Prohibited from operating in domestic market?

□ No substantial activity requirement?
  • Can benefits be obtained without real presence?
  • Brass plate companies tolerated?

□ Lack of transparency?
  • Secret rulings or negotiated rates?
  • Non-public criteria for benefits?

□ No effective information exchange?
  • Bank secrecy impediments?
  • Limitations on EOI cooperation?

□ For IP regimes: Nexus approach compliance?
  • Benefits linked to own R&D expenditure?
  • 30% uplift properly applied?

If multiple features present → POTENTIALLY HARMFUL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Link to Other Topics

Harmful tax competition connects to several other syllabus areas:

| Topic | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| **BEPS Actions (Chapter 7.2)** | Action 5 as minimum standard; broader BEPS context |
| **Transfer pricing** | Nexus approach uses arm's length concepts |
| **Information exchange** | Transparency framework; Article 26 OECD MTC |
| **Tax avoidance** | Harmful practices as avoidance enabler |
| **Pillar Two** | Global minimum tax addresses low-tax jurisdictions |

## Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Equating low tax rates with harmful | Low general rates not harmful per se | Focus on ring-fencing, lack of substance |
| Ignoring historical evolution | Misses context of current rules | Trace 1998 → BEPS Action 5 development |
| Confusing nexus with transfer pricing | Different but related concepts | Nexus = substance test; TP = arm's length pricing |
| Missing substance criterion restoration | Central to BEPS Action 5 | Emphasise return of substance requirement |
| Overlooking transparency workstream | Equal importance to regime review | Cover both FHTP workstreams |
| Not knowing current FHTP work | Shows outdated knowledge | Reference 332+ regimes reviewed, annual monitoring |
