## Chapter 9: State Responsibility in International Tax – The Development of the Concept of Harmful Tax Competition

### 1. Tax Competition and State Responsibility

Tax competition refers to the use of tax policy by states to attract mobile capital, investment, or economic activities from other jurisdictions. As capital has become increasingly mobile in the modern economy, states have competed to offer attractive tax environments, raising fundamental questions about the limits of fiscal sovereignty and whether states bear responsibility for the effects of their tax policies on other jurisdictions.

#### 1.1. The Concept of Tax Competition

From one perspective, tax competition is a legitimate exercise of fiscal sovereignty that promotes efficiency and disciplines government spending. States may reasonably choose different levels of taxation reflecting their preferences for public services versus private consumption, and competition ensures that governments cannot extract excessive rents from taxpayers. From another perspective, tax competition can trigger a race to the bottom that erodes all states' revenue bases, distorts the allocation of capital toward low-tax rather than high-productivity locations, and shifts the tax burden from mobile capital to immobile factors such as labour and consumption.

This debate frames the development of international standards distinguishing legitimate tax competition from harmful tax practices. The critical insight is that low tax rates are not themselves harmful—states retain sovereign authority to set their general tax rates at whatever level they choose. What becomes potentially harmful is the combination of low or preferential rates with other features that facilitate base erosion and profit shifting, particularly the absence of substantial economic activity and the lack of transparency.

#### 1.2. State Responsibility in Fiscal Matters

Traditional public international law provides limited constraints on tax sovereignty. However, the concept of harmful tax competition represents an emerging norm of state responsibility in fiscal matters. The underlying principle is that states should not adopt practices that unduly erode other states' tax bases by providing mechanisms for profits to be shifted out of jurisdictions where economic activity occurs. This responsibility is enforced not through binding international law but through soft law standards developed primarily by the OECD and implemented through peer review mechanisms that create reputational consequences for non-compliance.

### 2. The 1998 OECD Report

The OECD's 1998 report "Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue" was the first comprehensive international effort to address harmful tax practices. The report emerged from concerns about increased capital mobility in the 1990s, the growth of offshore financial centres, and recognition that unilateral measures by individual countries could not effectively address cross-border tax avoidance.

#### 2.1. Two Categories of Harmful Practices

The report distinguished between two categories of harmful practices. Tax havens were defined as jurisdictions with no or nominal taxes that offer themselves as places to escape tax otherwise due in other jurisdictions. These jurisdictions may have no interest in whether taxpayers have genuine economic activity there and may actively resist sharing information with other tax authorities. Preferential tax regimes were defined as regimes within otherwise normal tax systems that provide preferential treatment to certain activities or income types, typically mobile financial or intangible income that can readily be shifted between jurisdictions.

#### 2.2. The Original Criteria

The 1998 report established criteria for identifying tax havens. The starting point was no or only nominal taxation, which was not harmful in itself but triggered assessment against additional criteria. Lack of effective exchange of information meant refusal to provide information to other tax authorities, often reinforced by bank secrecy laws. Lack of transparency meant non-transparent operation of legislative, legal, or administrative provisions, including secret rulings and negotiated tax rates. The fourth criterion was no substantial activity requirement, meaning tolerance of brass plate companies with no real economic activity.

For preferential regimes within OECD member countries, the report identified ring-fencing from the domestic economy as a key indicator—regimes that benefited only non-residents or foreign income while excluding domestic taxpayers. Other indicators included absence of substantial activity requirements, lack of transparency in how benefits were granted, and failure to exchange information about taxpayers benefiting from the regime.

### 3. Evolution of the Framework

#### 3.1. Early Challenges and the Substance Retreat

The 1998 initiative faced significant challenges in its early years. Most significantly, the new US administration in 2001 withdrew support for the substance criterion, arguing that it inappropriately constrained legitimate tax competition. Many tax havens challenged the legitimacy of OECD standards, arguing that they had no voice in developing rules that would affect their economies. Small states argued they were being discriminated against by larger countries that had their own preferential regimes.

In response to these challenges, the OECD effectively abandoned the substance criterion and shifted focus to transparency and information exchange. The framework became primarily about ensuring that jurisdictions would share information with other tax authorities rather than about whether taxpayers had genuine economic activity in low-tax jurisdictions.

#### 3.2. Shift to Transparency Focus

Throughout the 2000s, the harmful tax practices agenda focused on transparency. The OECD developed the model Tax Information Exchange Agreement as a template for bilateral agreements requiring jurisdictions to exchange information on request. The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information in Tax Matters was established to monitor compliance with information exchange standards through peer review. By 2009, under G20 pressure in the aftermath of the financial crisis, virtually all significant financial centres had committed to implementing the internationally agreed tax standard for information exchange.

#### 3.3. BEPS Reinvigoration

The G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, launched in 2013 and completed in 2015, reinvigorated the harmful tax practices agenda with renewed emphasis on substance. BEPS Action 5 on countering harmful tax practices more effectively became one of the four BEPS minimum standards that all Inclusive Framework members committed to implement and that would be subject to peer review. Critically, Action 5 restored the substance requirement that had been abandoned in the early 2000s, reflecting recognition that transparency alone was insufficient to address profit shifting to jurisdictions without genuine economic activity (covered in December 2023).

### 4. BEPS Action 5: The Current Framework

#### 4.1. The Two Workstreams

BEPS Action 5 established two parallel workstreams. The first addresses preferential regimes, reviewing IP regimes and other preferential arrangements to ensure they meet substance requirements. The second addresses transparency, establishing a framework for compulsory spontaneous exchange of information on tax rulings between jurisdictions. Both workstreams are administered by the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices and are subject to peer review by the Inclusive Framework.

#### 4.2. Modified Nexus Approach for IP Regimes

For IP regimes such as patent boxes and innovation boxes, BEPS Action 5 introduced the modified nexus approach. The core principle is that tax benefits from IP income must be linked to the research and development expenditure incurred by the taxpayer that generated the IP. This uses expenditure as a proxy for substantial activity—if a taxpayer performed or funded the R&D activities that created the IP, the benefits are available; if the taxpayer merely acquired the IP or had related parties perform the R&D, benefits are limited.

The approach operates through a formula that calculates qualifying income based on the ratio of qualifying expenditure to overall expenditure. Qualifying expenditure includes R&D costs incurred directly by the taxpayer or outsourced to unrelated parties at arm's length. Overall expenditure includes all costs to develop the IP, including acquisition costs and related-party R&D costs. A thirty percent uplift allows some credit for related-party or acquisition costs, up to thirty percent of qualifying expenditure, recognising that complete exclusion of such costs would be excessively restrictive.

The practical effect is that an entity that performs its own R&D or outsources to independent contractors receives the full benefit of an IP regime. An entity that merely acquires IP or has related parties perform R&D receives limited benefits proportionate to any direct expenditure it incurred. This ensures that IP regime benefits flow to entities with genuine R&D activities rather than to holding structures that have acquired or been assigned intellectual property.

#### 4.3. Substance Requirements for Non-IP Regimes

For non-IP preferential regimes including headquarters regimes, holding company regimes, and financing regimes, BEPS Action 5 requires substantial activity in the jurisdiction. Entities must undertake core income-generating activities in the jurisdiction, maintain adequate employees with appropriate qualifications, have adequate physical presence, and incur adequate expenditure proportionate to their activities.

These requirements have been extended to jurisdictions with no or only nominal taxation, even absent preferential regimes. Entities in such jurisdictions must demonstrate economic substance appropriate to their activities—taking strategic decisions for headquarters functions, making investment decisions for holding companies, managing risks and maintaining capital for financing activities, and so forth. Many of these jurisdictions have enacted economic substance legislation to comply with international standards.

### 5. The Forum on Harmful Tax Practices

The Forum on Harmful Tax Practices is the OECD body responsible for implementing Action 5. It reviews preferential tax regimes submitted by member jurisdictions, monitors jurisdictions with no or only nominal taxation, administers the transparency framework for spontaneous exchange of rulings, and conducts peer reviews of compliance with the minimum standard.

Since the BEPS project began, the FHTP has reviewed over three hundred preferential regimes. More than forty percent have been abolished or amended to comply with the nexus approach or substance requirements. The remaining regimes have been assessed as not harmful or are in the process of being amended. The FHTP also conducts annual monitoring of jurisdictions with no or only nominal taxation, currently including Anguilla, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, and Turks and Caicos Islands. The United Arab Emirates was removed from this list after introducing a nine percent corporate income tax in 2023.

### 6. Challenges and Future Directions

The FHTP faces ongoing challenges in its work. Ensuring consistent implementation across more than one hundred forty Inclusive Framework jurisdictions requires significant monitoring resources. Tax planning practices continue to evolve in response to new rules, and the FHTP must adapt its framework to address emerging structures. Developing countries often lack the administrative capacity to implement sophisticated substance requirements or participate effectively in information exchange. The line between legitimate and harmful tax competition remains contested, with some jurisdictions arguing that the framework unduly constrains their development options.

The relationship between the harmful tax practices framework and Pillar Two of the two-pillar solution raises important questions about future direction. Pillar Two's global minimum tax of fifteen percent directly addresses low-taxed income by allowing parent jurisdictions to impose top-up tax on subsidiaries taxed below the minimum rate. This may reduce the importance of traditional FHTP work on preferential regimes, since enterprises within scope of Pillar Two will face at least fifteen percent tax regardless of where they book profits. However, the FHTP continues as a complementary framework, and substance requirements remain relevant even with a minimum tax—an entity with genuine R&D activity may deserve different treatment than a brass plate holding company, even if both face the same minimum effective rate (covered in June 2025).

The harmful tax practices framework represents a significant evolution in international tax cooperation. From its origins in the 1998 report through the transparency focus of the 2000s to the reinvigorated substance requirements under BEPS, the concept of state responsibility in fiscal matters has developed from an aspirational principle to an operational framework with peer review mechanisms that create meaningful accountability for participating jurisdictions.
