EXAM INTELLIGENCE: Methods of Relieving Double Taxation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Frequency: 75% of exams (6/8 papers 2022-2025)
Mark Range: 12-20 marks
Syllabus Level: 2 (detailed knowledge required)

Key Question Patterns:
  • Dec 2022 Q2: Relief systems and policy considerations (credit vs exemption)
  • June 2025 Q5: Foreign tax credits for digital taxes
  • Dec 2020 Q7: Residence/source conflicts with relief mechanisms
  • Combined with residence/PE questions requiring relief calculations

Examiner Focus:
  • Comparing exemption and credit methods (advantages/disadvantages)
  • Calculating relief under Articles 23A and 23B
  • Policy analysis: Capital Import vs Capital Export Neutrality
  • Practical difficulties in applying relief methods
  • Understanding tax sparing credits and their policy rationale

Strategic Priority: ★★★★☆ HIGH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHY THIS MATTERS: Relief methods are the practical mechanism that
makes the international tax treaty system work. Without Articles 23A
and 23B, treaties would allocate taxing rights but leave taxpayers
bearing the full burden of double taxation. Understanding these
methods is essential for any international tax calculation question.

## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION: WHY RELIEF METHODS ARE NECESSARY

### 1. The Treaty Architecture Recap

As established in Chapter 4.1, international double taxation arises primarily from the overlap between:
- **Residence state**: Claims worldwide taxation of its residents
- **Source state**: Claims territorial taxation of income arising within its borders

The OECD Model Tax Convention addresses this through a **two-step process**:

| Step | Function | Relevant Articles |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Step 1** | Allocate taxing rights between states | Articles 6-22 (Distributive Rules) |
| **Step 2** | Eliminate remaining double taxation | Articles 23A/23B (Relief Methods) |

The distributive rules (Step 1) determine **which state may tax** each type of income. However, for many income types, **both states retain taxing rights**—dividends, interest, and certain other income categories are subject to shared allocation. Step 2 becomes essential: the residence state must provide relief to prevent the taxpayer from paying tax twice on the same income.

### 2. The Three Categories of Relief

Relief from international double taxation can be provided through three main categories of mechanisms:

```

```

### 3. Unilateral vs Bilateral Relief

Before examining treaty-based relief, it is important to understand that relief may come from two sources:

| Source | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Unilateral Relief** | Provided by domestic law regardless of treaty | UK Foreign Tax Credit under domestic legislation |
| **Bilateral Relief** | Provided under a tax treaty between two states | Relief under UK-Germany DTA Article 23 |

Most countries provide unilateral relief for foreign taxes paid, but treaty-based relief is typically more generous and certain. The OECD Model requires contracting states to provide relief, creating a binding obligation rather than discretionary domestic law provisions.

## B. ARTICLE 23A: THE EXEMPTION METHOD

### 1. Text and Structure of Article 23A

Article 23A OECD MTC provides:

> "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, **exempt such income or capital from tax**."

The exemption method operates on a simple principle: if the source state has the right to tax under the treaty's distributive rules, the residence state **gives up its right to tax** that income entirely.

### 2. How the Exemption Method Works

```
EXEMPTION METHOD OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Taxpayer resident in Country R earns:
  • Domestic income: €200,000
  • Foreign income from Country S: €100,000
  • Country R tax rate: 40%
  • Country S tax rate: 25%

UNDER EXEMPTION METHOD:

Step 1: Identify foreign income taxable in source state
        → €100,000 may be taxed in Country S under distributive rules

Step 2: Exclude from residence state tax base
        Country R taxable income: €200,000 (only domestic income)
        Country R tax: €200,000 × 40% = €80,000

Step 3: Calculate total tax burden
        Country S tax: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000
        Country R tax: €80,000
        Total tax: €105,000

RESULT: Foreign income taxed at source rate ONLY (25%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Exemption with Progression (Article 23A(3))

The most common form of exemption is **exemption with progression**. Article 23A(3) provides that the residence state may take the exempted income into account when determining the tax rate applicable to other income.

```
EXEMPTION WITH PROGRESSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Same facts, but Country R has progressive rates:
  • €0-100,000: 20%
  • €100,001-200,000: 35%
  • €200,001+: 45%

FULL EXEMPTION (without progression):
  Taxable in R: €200,000 (domestic only)
  Tax bands: €100,000 × 20% + €100,000 × 35% = €55,000
  Effective rate on domestic income: 27.5%

EXEMPTION WITH PROGRESSION:
  Step 1: Calculate average rate on worldwide income
          Total income: €300,000
          Tax on €300,000: €100,000×20% + €100,000×35% + €100,000×45% = €100,000
          Average rate: €100,000 / €300,000 = 33.33%

  Step 2: Apply average rate to non-exempt income
          Tax: €200,000 × 33.33% = €66,660

  Effective rate on domestic income: 33.33%

DIFFERENCE: €66,660 - €55,000 = €11,660 additional tax
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Rationale for Exemption with Progression**: Without progression, taxpayers with foreign income would benefit from lower tax rates on their domestic income (starting again from the lowest bracket). This would create an artificial incentive to earn foreign income and could be seen as unfair to purely domestic taxpayers. The progression rule ensures that all income is considered when determining the taxpayer's ability to pay.

### 4. Full Exemption vs Exemption with Progression

| Feature | Full Exemption | Exemption with Progression |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Foreign income** | Completely ignored | Considered for rate calculation |
| **Domestic income rate** | Lower brackets apply | Average worldwide rate applies |
| **Taxpayer benefit** | Greater (rate arbitrage) | Lower but fairer |
| **Countries using** | Rare (some special regimes) | Most exemption countries (NL, BE, LU) |
| **Policy rationale** | Maximum investment incentive | Fairness, ability to pay |

### 5. Countries Using the Exemption Method

Several major economies traditionally favor the exemption method:

| Country | Scope of Exemption | Notable Features |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Netherlands** | Broad participation exemption | Business income, qualifying dividends |
| **Belgium** | Participation exemption | 95% dividend exemption for qualifying holdings |
| **Luxembourg** | Participation exemption | Part of attractive holding company regime |
| **Germany** | Exemption for active foreign income | Often with subject-to-tax clauses |
| **France** | Territorial system (post-2020) | Exemption for qualifying foreign profits |

## C. ARTICLE 23B: THE CREDIT METHOD

### 1. Text and Structure of Article 23B

Article 23B OECD MTC provides:

> "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall allow as a **deduction from the tax on the income or capital** of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in that other State."

The credit method takes a fundamentally different approach: instead of excluding foreign income from the tax base, the residence state **includes worldwide income but allows a credit** for foreign taxes paid.

### 2. How the Credit Method Works

```
CREDIT METHOD OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Same taxpayer as exemption example
  • Domestic income: €200,000
  • Foreign income from Country S: €100,000
  • Country R tax rate: 40%
  • Country S tax rate: 25%

UNDER CREDIT METHOD:

Step 1: Calculate tax on worldwide income
        Total income: €300,000
        Country R tax (40%): €120,000

Step 2: Calculate foreign tax paid
        Country S tax: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000

Step 3: Apply credit (limited to domestic tax on foreign income)
        Maximum credit: €100,000 × 40% = €40,000
        Actual foreign tax: €25,000
        Credit allowed: €25,000 (lower of two)

Step 4: Calculate final liability
        Country R tax: €120,000 - €25,000 = €95,000
        Country S tax: €25,000
        Total tax: €120,000

RESULT: Effective rate = 40% (higher of the two rates)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. The Credit Limitation: Ordinary vs Full Credit

The **ordinary credit** (or limited credit) limits the credit to the residence state's own tax on the foreign income. This is the standard approach under Article 23B.

```
ORDINARY CREDIT VS FULL CREDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Higher foreign tax rate
  • Foreign income: €100,000
  • Country R rate: 25%
  • Country S rate: 40%

ORDINARY CREDIT (Limited):
  Country R tax on foreign income: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000
  Country S tax paid: €100,000 × 40% = €40,000
  Credit allowed: €25,000 (limited to R's tax)
  Excess credit: €15,000 (lost or carried forward)
  Total tax: €40,000 (S) + €0 (R after credit) = €40,000
  Effective rate: 40% (source state rate)

FULL CREDIT (Unlimited):
  Credit allowed: €40,000 (full foreign tax)
  Country R tax on all income less credit
  May reduce tax on domestic income
  Rarely used—creates revenue loss for residence state
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Key Point for Exams**: Under the ordinary credit method:
- If foreign rate < domestic rate: credit fully utilized, taxpayer "tops up" to domestic rate
- If foreign rate > domestic rate: excess credit lost (or carried forward if domestic law permits)

### 4. Countries Using the Credit Method

| Country | Notable Features |
|---------|------------------|
| **United States** | Per-country and overall limitation, complex basket system |
| **United Kingdom** | Ordinary credit, excess may not reduce other UK tax |
| **Japan** | Ordinary credit with indirect credit for subsidiaries |
| **Australia** | Foreign income tax offset (FITO) system |
| **Canada** | Foreign tax credit with detailed calculation rules |

## D. COMPARISON: EXEMPTION VS CREDIT

### 1. Summary Comparison Table

| Feature | Exemption Method (23A) | Credit Method (23B) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Foreign income excluded from tax base | Foreign tax credited against domestic liability |
| **Effective tax rate** | Source state rate | Higher of source/residence rate |
| **Residence state revenue** | Gives up tax on foreign income | Retains tax to extent of domestic rate |
| **Administrative burden** | Lower (no credit calculations) | Higher (verification of foreign tax) |
| **Economic neutrality** | Capital Import Neutrality | Capital Export Neutrality |
| **Effect on investment** | Favors investment in low-tax countries | Neutral between domestic/foreign investment |

### 3. When Each Method Produces Different Results

| Scenario | Exemption Result | Credit Result |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Source rate < Residence rate | Taxpayer benefits (lower effective rate) | Taxpayer pays top-up to residence rate |
| Source rate = Residence rate | Same effective rate | Same effective rate |
| Source rate > Residence rate | Effective rate = source rate | Effective rate = source rate (excess credit lost) |

## F. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
ESSENTIAL POINTS TO REMEMBER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TWO MAIN TREATY METHODS:
   • Exemption (Art 23A): Foreign income excluded from tax base
   • Credit (Art 23B): Foreign tax credited against residence state tax

2. KEY OUTCOME DIFFERENCE:
   • Exemption: Effective rate = SOURCE state rate
   • Credit: Effective rate = HIGHER of source/residence rates

3. EXEMPTION WITH PROGRESSION:
   • Most common form of exemption method
   • Foreign income affects rate but not tax base
   • Prevents rate arbitrage

4. CREDIT LIMITATION (ORDINARY CREDIT):
   • Credit limited to residence state's tax on foreign income
   • Excess foreign tax is lost (or carried forward)
   • Ensures residence state never pays a refund

5. POLICY TRADE-OFFS:
   • Exemption → Capital Import Neutrality
   • Credit → Capital Export Neutrality
   • Neither achieves full neutrality

6. EXAM CALCULATION TIPS:
   • Always show workings
   • State the method being applied
   • Calculate credit limit separately
   • Compare with alternative if asked
