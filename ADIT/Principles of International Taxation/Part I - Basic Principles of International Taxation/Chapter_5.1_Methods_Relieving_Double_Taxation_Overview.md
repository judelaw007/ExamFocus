━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHY THIS MATTERS: Relief methods are the practical mechanism that
makes the international tax treaty system work. Without Articles 23A
and 23B, treaties would allocate taxing rights but leave taxpayers
bearing the full burden of double taxation. Understanding these
methods is essential for any international tax calculation question.

## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION: WHY RELIEF METHODS ARE NECESSARY

### 1. The Historical Context: A Problem That Demanded Solutions

The need for double taxation relief emerged alongside the growth of international commerce in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As businesses expanded across borders and individuals began earning income in multiple countries, the collision between residence-based and source-based taxation created an urgent problem: the same income was being taxed twice, sometimes at combined rates exceeding 100% of the income earned.

The League of Nations recognized this threat to international trade and investment as early as the 1920s. Their economists understood that unchecked double taxation would strangle cross-border economic activity—why would anyone invest abroad if governments would collectively take more than the entire return? This recognition drove the development of the first model tax conventions and, crucially, the relief mechanisms we study today.

What makes relief methods intellectually fascinating is that they represent a negotiated compromise between competing sovereign interests. Every country wants to maximize its tax revenue, yet every country also wants its residents and businesses to engage in international commerce. Relief methods are the diplomatic solution to this tension—they require one state (typically the residence state) to sacrifice potential revenue so that the international tax system can function.

### 2. The Treaty Architecture Recap

As established in Chapter 4.1, international double taxation arises primarily from the overlap between:
- **Residence state**: Claims worldwide taxation of its residents
- **Source state**: Claims territorial taxation of income arising within its borders

The OECD Model Tax Convention addresses this through a **two-step process**:

| Step | Function | Relevant Articles |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Step 1** | Allocate taxing rights between states | Articles 6-22 (Distributive Rules) |
| **Step 2** | Eliminate remaining double taxation | Articles 23A/23B (Relief Methods) |

The distributive rules (Step 1) determine **which state may tax** each type of income. However, for many income types, **both states retain taxing rights**—dividends, interest, and certain other income categories are subject to shared allocation. Step 2 becomes essential: the residence state must provide relief to prevent the taxpayer from paying tax twice on the same income.

It is worth pausing to consider why the burden of providing relief falls on the residence state rather than the source state. This reflects a philosophical choice embedded in the OECD Model: source-state taxation is treated as primary, and residence-state taxation is residual. The source state taxes first (because economic activity occurred there), and the residence state then adjusts to prevent double taxation. This ordering has profound implications—it means that source-state tax rates effectively set a floor for taxation, which has historically favored developed countries where most multinational parents are resident.

### 3. The Three Categories of Relief

Relief from international double taxation can be provided through three main categories of mechanisms:

```
RELIEF MECHANISMS HIERARCHY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Full   With      Direct  Indirect  Deduction  Deferral
   Exemp  Progress  Credit  Credit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The choice between these mechanisms is not merely technical—it reflects deep policy choices about how a country views its role in the global economy. Countries that see themselves as capital exporters (sending investment abroad) tend to prefer the credit method, which preserves their tax base. Countries that see themselves as capital importers (receiving foreign investment) or as financial centers (facilitating international structures) tend to prefer exemption, which makes their resident companies more competitive internationally.

### 4. Unilateral vs Bilateral Relief

Before examining treaty-based relief, it is important to understand that relief may come from two sources:

| Source | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Unilateral Relief** | Provided by domestic law regardless of treaty | UK Foreign Tax Credit under domestic legislation |
| **Bilateral Relief** | Provided under a tax treaty between two states | Relief under UK-Germany DTA Article 23 |

Most countries provide unilateral relief for foreign taxes paid, but treaty-based relief is typically more generous and certain. The OECD Model requires contracting states to provide relief, creating a binding obligation rather than discretionary domestic law provisions.

The distinction matters in practice because unilateral relief may be withdrawn or modified at any time by domestic legislation, whereas treaty relief is protected by international law. This is why sophisticated tax planning often depends on the existence of favorable treaties rather than relying solely on domestic relief provisions. When a country changes its domestic relief rules—as the United States did dramatically in its 2017 tax reform—the impact on international structures can be profound.

## B. ARTICLE 23A: THE EXEMPTION METHOD

### 1. Text and Structure of Article 23A

Article 23A OECD MTC provides:

> "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, **exempt such income or capital from tax**."

The exemption method operates on a simple principle: if the source state has the right to tax under the treaty's distributive rules, the residence state **gives up its right to tax** that income entirely.

This apparent simplicity masks a radical policy choice. When a country adopts the exemption method, it is declaring that it will not attempt to impose its own tax policy preferences on income earned abroad. A Dutch company earning profits in a 15% tax jurisdiction keeps those profits at 15%—the Netherlands does not "top up" to its own rate. This restraint reflects a territorial philosophy: income belongs to where it was earned, and the residence state should not interfere.

### 2. How the Exemption Method Works

```
EXEMPTION METHOD OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Taxpayer resident in Country R earns:
  • Domestic income: €200,000
  • Foreign income from Country S: €100,000
  • Country R tax rate: 40%
  • Country S tax rate: 25%

UNDER EXEMPTION METHOD:

Step 1: Identify foreign income taxable in source state
        → €100,000 may be taxed in Country S under distributive rules

Step 2: Exclude from residence state tax base
        Country R taxable income: €200,000 (only domestic income)
        Country R tax: €200,000 × 40% = €80,000

Step 3: Calculate total tax burden
        Country S tax: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000
        Country R tax: €80,000
        Total tax: €105,000

RESULT: Foreign income taxed at source rate ONLY (25%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Exemption with Progression (Article 23A(3))

The most common form of exemption is **exemption with progression**. Article 23A(3) provides that the residence state may take the exempted income into account when determining the tax rate applicable to other income.

This mechanism represents an elegant compromise. Pure exemption would allow taxpayers to artificially lower their tax rates by earning some foreign income—essentially "resetting" their position in progressive rate bands. Exemption with progression prevents this gaming while still achieving the core goal of not taxing foreign income.

```
EXEMPTION WITH PROGRESSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Same facts, but Country R has progressive rates:
  • €0-100,000: 20%
  • €100,001-200,000: 35%
  • €200,001+: 45%

FULL EXEMPTION (without progression):
  Taxable in R: €200,000 (domestic only)
  Tax bands: €100,000 × 20% + €100,000 × 35% = €55,000
  Effective rate on domestic income: 27.5%

EXEMPTION WITH PROGRESSION:
  Step 1: Calculate average rate on worldwide income
          Total income: €300,000
          Tax on €300,000: €100,000×20% + €100,000×35% + €100,000×45% = €100,000
          Average rate: €100,000 / €300,000 = 33.33%

  Step 2: Apply average rate to non-exempt income
          Tax: €200,000 × 33.33% = €66,660

  Effective rate on domestic income: 33.33%

DIFFERENCE: €66,660 - €55,000 = €11,660 additional tax
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Rationale for Exemption with Progression**: The progression rule reflects the "ability to pay" principle that underlies most income tax systems. A taxpayer earning €300,000 total has greater ability to pay than one earning €200,000, even if €100,000 of the first taxpayer's income is exempt. By considering total income for rate purposes, the system maintains horizontal equity—two people with the same total income face similar effective rates on their domestic earnings.

Consider the alternative: without progression, a purely domestic taxpayer earning €200,000 would pay €55,000, while an internationally mobile taxpayer with €200,000 domestic and €100,000 foreign would pay the same €55,000 domestically plus only €25,000 abroad—a total of €80,000 on €300,000 versus €55,000 on €200,000. The domestic taxpayer would rightly feel this was unfair.

### 4. Full Exemption vs Exemption with Progression

| Feature | Full Exemption | Exemption with Progression |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Foreign income** | Completely ignored | Considered for rate calculation |
| **Domestic income rate** | Lower brackets apply | Average worldwide rate applies |
| **Taxpayer benefit** | Greater (rate arbitrage) | Lower but fairer |
| **Countries using** | Rare (some special regimes) | Most exemption countries (NL, BE, LU) |
| **Policy rationale** | Maximum investment incentive | Fairness, ability to pay |

### 5. Countries Using the Exemption Method

Several major economies traditionally favor the exemption method. Understanding why reveals much about international tax policy:

| Country | Scope of Exemption | Notable Features |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Netherlands** | Broad participation exemption | Business income, qualifying dividends |
| **Belgium** | Participation exemption | 95% dividend exemption for qualifying holdings |
| **Luxembourg** | Participation exemption | Part of attractive holding company regime |
| **Germany** | Exemption for active foreign income | Often with subject-to-tax clauses |
| **France** | Territorial system (post-2020) | Exemption for qualifying foreign profits |

The Netherlands provides perhaps the most instructive example. Dutch tax policy has long been shaped by the country's role as a small, open economy dependent on international trade. Dutch policymakers recognized early that their multinationals needed to compete globally, and imposing additional Dutch tax on foreign earnings would handicap them against competitors from territorial-system countries. The participation exemption became a cornerstone of Dutch attractiveness as a holding company location—a status that has generated significant economic activity and employment even as it has drawn criticism for facilitating aggressive tax planning.

Germany's approach is more cautious, reflecting both its larger domestic market (which reduces dependence on outward investment) and its stronger tradition of using tax policy to achieve social equity. German treaties typically include subject-to-tax clauses that switch from exemption to credit if the foreign income wasn't actually taxed abroad—preventing the "double non-taxation" that pure exemption systems can enable.

## C. ARTICLE 23B: THE CREDIT METHOD

### 1. Text and Structure of Article 23B

Article 23B OECD MTC provides:

> "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall allow as a **deduction from the tax on the income or capital** of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in that other State."

The credit method takes a fundamentally different approach: instead of excluding foreign income from the tax base, the residence state **includes worldwide income but allows a credit** for foreign taxes paid.

This difference reflects a fundamentally different philosophy of taxation. Credit-method countries assert that their tax system should apply uniformly to all income earned by their residents, regardless of source. The credit prevents double taxation, but the residence state maintains its policy that residents should bear at least the domestic tax burden on all their income. Where exemption says "we won't interfere with foreign income," credit says "we'll account for foreign tax but our standards still apply."

### 2. How the Credit Method Works

```
CREDIT METHOD OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Same taxpayer as exemption example
  • Domestic income: €200,000
  • Foreign income from Country S: €100,000
  • Country R tax rate: 40%
  • Country S tax rate: 25%

UNDER CREDIT METHOD:

Step 1: Calculate tax on worldwide income
        Total income: €300,000
        Country R tax (40%): €120,000

Step 2: Calculate foreign tax paid
        Country S tax: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000

Step 3: Apply credit (limited to domestic tax on foreign income)
        Maximum credit: €100,000 × 40% = €40,000
        Actual foreign tax: €25,000
        Credit allowed: €25,000 (lower of two)

Step 4: Calculate final liability
        Country R tax: €120,000 - €25,000 = €95,000
        Country S tax: €25,000
        Total tax: €120,000

RESULT: Effective rate = 40% (higher of the two rates)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. The Credit Limitation: Ordinary vs Full Credit

The **ordinary credit** (or limited credit) limits the credit to the residence state's own tax on the foreign income. This is the standard approach under Article 23B.

The limitation exists for a compelling reason: without it, a residence state could find itself effectively subsidizing high-tax foreign countries. If a taxpayer earns income in a 50% tax jurisdiction and the residence state rate is 30%, unlimited credit would mean the residence state refunds the 20% difference—transferring its own revenue to compensate for another country's tax choices. No country willingly accepts this position.

```
ORDINARY CREDIT VS FULL CREDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Higher foreign tax rate
  • Foreign income: €100,000
  • Country R rate: 25%
  • Country S rate: 40%

ORDINARY CREDIT (Limited):
  Country R tax on foreign income: €100,000 × 25% = €25,000
  Country S tax paid: €100,000 × 40% = €40,000
  Credit allowed: €25,000 (limited to R's tax)
  Excess credit: €15,000 (lost or carried forward)
  Total tax: €40,000 (S) + €0 (R after credit) = €40,000
  Effective rate: 40% (source state rate)

FULL CREDIT (Unlimited):
  Credit allowed: €40,000 (full foreign tax)
  Country R tax on all income less credit
  May reduce tax on domestic income
  Rarely used—creates revenue loss for residence state
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Key Point for Exams**: Under the ordinary credit method:
- If foreign rate < domestic rate: credit fully utilized, taxpayer "tops up" to domestic rate
- If foreign rate > domestic rate: excess credit lost (or carried forward if domestic law permits)

The treatment of excess credits reveals an important asymmetry. Under credit systems, investing in low-tax countries provides no tax benefit (you pay the domestic rate either way), but investing in high-tax countries imposes a penalty (excess credits may be lost). This creates a bias against high-tax locations that exemption systems do not share—under exemption, you simply pay whatever the source country charges. This asymmetry has been criticized as penalizing investment in countries with strong public services and infrastructure funded by higher taxes.

### 4. Countries Using the Credit Method

| Country | Notable Features |
|---------|------------------|
| **United States** | Per-country and overall limitation, complex basket system |
| **United Kingdom** | Ordinary credit, excess may not reduce other UK tax |
| **Japan** | Ordinary credit with indirect credit for subsidiaries |
| **Australia** | Foreign income tax offset (FITO) system |
| **Canada** | Foreign tax credit with detailed calculation rules |

The United States historically exemplified the credit approach, reflecting its status as both a major capital exporter and a country with deep concerns about revenue erosion. American policymakers feared that exemption would encourage companies to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions—a fear that proved prescient as base erosion became a global concern. However, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act moved the US toward a hybrid system with participation exemption for dividends from foreign subsidiaries, acknowledging that pure credit was putting US multinationals at a competitive disadvantage.

The UK's position is particularly interesting because British tax policy has evolved significantly over time. The UK maintained strong credit method traditions throughout the 20th century but has gradually adopted more territorial features, recognizing that as an open, trade-dependent economy, excessive residence taxation handicaps British business. This evolution reflects a broader global trend: even credit-method countries are moving toward hybrid systems that incorporate exemption elements.

### 3. When Each Method Produces Different Results

| Scenario | Exemption Result | Credit Result |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Source rate < Residence rate | Taxpayer benefits (lower effective rate) | Taxpayer pays top-up to residence rate |
| Source rate = Residence rate | Same effective rate | Same effective rate |
| Source rate > Residence rate | Effective rate = source rate | Effective rate = source rate (excess credit lost) |

### 4. The Deeper Policy Tension

The choice between exemption and credit methods reflects a fundamental question that has no objectively correct answer: **whose tax policy preferences should govern cross-border income?**

The credit method asserts residence-state primacy. It says that if Country R has decided its citizens should pay 40% tax on income, that policy should apply regardless of where income is earned. The source state gets to tax first, but the residence state has the final word on the effective rate. This preserves residence-state sovereignty over its residents' total tax burden.

The exemption method asserts source-state primacy. It says that income belongs to where it was generated, and the source state's tax policy choices should be respected. If Country S has decided that a 25% rate best balances its needs for revenue against its desire to attract investment, Country R should not second-guess that choice by imposing additional tax.

Neither position is inherently superior—they reflect different values and different assessments of what makes international taxation fair and efficient. The ongoing evolution in global tax policy, including Pillar Two's global minimum tax, represents yet another attempt to resolve this tension by establishing a floor that limits how much source-state tax competition can erode the global tax base.

## F. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
ESSENTIAL POINTS TO REMEMBER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TWO MAIN TREATY METHODS:
   • Exemption (Art 23A): Foreign income excluded from tax base
   • Credit (Art 23B): Foreign tax credited against residence state tax

2. KEY OUTCOME DIFFERENCE:
   • Exemption: Effective rate = SOURCE state rate
   • Credit: Effective rate = HIGHER of source/residence rates

3. EXEMPTION WITH PROGRESSION:
   • Most common form of exemption method
   • Foreign income affects rate but not tax base
   • Prevents rate arbitrage while respecting ability to pay

4. CREDIT LIMITATION (ORDINARY CREDIT):
   • Credit limited to residence state's tax on foreign income
   • Excess foreign tax is lost (or carried forward)
   • Ensures residence state never subsidizes high-tax countries

5. POLICY TRADE-OFFS:
   • Exemption → Capital Import Neutrality (level playing field in source country)
   • Credit → Capital Export Neutrality (same rate regardless of investment location)
   • Neither achieves full neutrality—countries must choose priorities

6. COUNTRY CHOICES REFLECT ECONOMIC POSITION:
   • Small, open economies favor exemption (competitiveness)
   • Large, capital-exporting economies historically favored credit (revenue)
   • Global trend toward hybrid systems with territorial elements
