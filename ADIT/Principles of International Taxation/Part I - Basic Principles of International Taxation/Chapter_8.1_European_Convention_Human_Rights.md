## 1. Introduction: Human Rights and Taxation

### 1. The Fundamental Tension

Taxation involves the compulsory extraction of private property by the state. This raises fundamental questions about individual rights:

| Tension | State Interest | Individual Interest |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Property** | Revenue collection | Protection from arbitrary deprivation |
| **Equality** | Tax policy flexibility | Non-discriminatory treatment |
| **Process** | Efficient administration | Fair procedures and access to justice |
| **Privacy** | Information gathering | Data protection |

Human rights instruments provide a framework for balancing these competing interests, though they generally accord states wide discretion in tax matters.

### 2. The ECHR in Context

The **European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)**, adopted in 1950, is administered by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg. Key features:

- Applies to 46 Council of Europe member states
- Allows individual petition to ECtHR after domestic remedies exhausted
- Judgments binding on respondent states
- Supplemented by Protocols (notably Protocol 1 on property)

```
ECHR STRUCTURE RELEVANT TO TAXATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MAIN CONVENTION
├── Article 6   → Right to fair trial
├── Article 8   → Right to private life
├── Article 14  → Prohibition of discrimination
│
PROTOCOL NO. 1
├── Article 1   → Protection of property (A1P1)

MOST RELEVANT TO TAX: Article 1, Protocol 1 (A1P1)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 2. Article 1, Protocol 1: Protection of Property

### 1. The Text

Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (A1P1) states:

> *"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.*
>
> *The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."*

### 2. The Three Rules

The ECtHR has interpreted A1P1 as containing three distinct rules:

| Rule | Content | Application to Tax |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **First rule** | Peaceful enjoyment of possessions | General principle |
| **Second rule** | Deprivation only in public interest | Confiscation, expropriation |
| **Third rule** | State may control use of property to secure tax | **Express taxation exception** |

The **third rule** expressly permits states to "secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties." This is the most directly relevant provision for taxation.

### 3. Key Principles from Case Law

**Wide margin of appreciation:**
States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in tax matters. The ECtHR has consistently held that:
- States alone are competent to assess political, economic, and social factors
- Tax policy choices are primarily for national authorities
- The Court will not second-guess tax policy decisions unless clearly arbitrary

**Lawfulness requirement:**
Tax measures must be "provided for by law":
- Clear legal basis required
- Accessible and foreseeable legislation
- Protection against arbitrary interference

**Proportionality:**
Even with the taxation exception, measures must not impose an "excessive burden":
- Must not fundamentally interfere with financial position
- Must achieve reasonable balance between public and private interests
- Clear arbitrariness may violate A1P1

```
EXAM TIP: The Taxation Exception
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The key point for exam purposes:

A1P1 EXPRESSLY PERMITS taxation as interference with property

This means:
✓ Taxation is inherently an interference with property rights
✓ BUT the Convention expressly allows this interference
✓ States have WIDE discretion in tax matters
✓ VERY FEW tax cases succeed under A1P1

Successful challenges typically involve:
• Clear arbitrariness
• Procedural unfairness
• Excessive individual burden
• Enforcement excesses (not tax policy itself)

## 3. Leading Cases on Taxation and A1P1

### 1. National & Provincial Building Society v United Kingdom (1997)

**Facts:**
- UK Parliament enacted retrospective legislation to close a tax loophole
- Building societies challenged the retrospective taxation as violating A1P1
- Legislation subjected interest to double taxation

**Held:**
- No violation of A1P1
- States have wide margin of appreciation in tax matters
- Retrospective tax legislation is not prohibited per se
- Parliament acted to correct a manifest deficiency in the law

**Key principle:**
> There is **no general principle against retrospective taxation** under the ECHR.

### 2. Burden v United Kingdom (2008)

**Facts:**
- Two elderly sisters challenged UK inheritance tax rules
- Married couples and civil partners exempt; cohabiting siblings not
- Sisters argued discrimination under Article 14 + A1P1

**Held (Grand Chamber):**
- No violation of Article 14 in conjunction with A1P1
- Cohabiting sisters not in "relevantly similar position" to married/civil partnership couples
- States retain discretion in tax policy regarding different categories
- No discrimination where objective and reasonable justification exists

**Key principle:**
> Different treatment in tax matters is permissible where there is **objective and reasonable justification**.

### 3. Stec v United Kingdom (2006)

**Facts:**
- Challenged differential retirement ages for men and women affecting benefits

**Key principle:**
> "Possessions" under A1P1 can include welfare benefits and tax entitlements where there is a sufficient legal basis creating a legitimate expectation.

### 4. M.A. and Others v Finland (2003)

**Facts:**
- Tax assessment challenged as disproportionate

**Key principles:**
- Tax measures must not place "excessive burden" on taxpayer
- Must not "fundamentally interfere" with financial position
- Balance required between public interest and individual rights

---

## 4. Article 6: Right to Fair Trial and Tax Disputes

### 1. The Ferrazzini Limitation

**Ferrazzini v Italy (2001)** is a landmark case establishing a significant limitation:

**Facts:**
- Italian taxpayer complained that tax proceedings took 14 years
- Argued violation of Article 6(1) (right to hearing within reasonable time)

**Held (Grand Chamber, 11-6):**
- Article 6(1) does **NOT apply** to tax disputes
- Tax matters are "hard core of public-authority prerogatives"
- Public nature of taxpayer-state relationship predominant
- Tax disputes are not "civil rights and obligations"

```
CRITICAL DISTINCTION: ECHR vs EU Charter
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                     ECHR Article 6      EU Charter Article 47
                     ───────────────     ─────────────────────
Tax disputes:        EXCLUDED            INCLUDED
                     (Ferrazzini)        (broader scope)

This means:
• Under ECHR, no right to fair trial in tax disputes
• Under EU law, fair trial rights DO apply to tax matters
• EU law provides stronger taxpayer procedural rights

For ADIT: Know this distinction but note Module 1 focuses on
general international tax, not specifically EU tax law.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Exceptions: When Article 6 May Apply

Article 6 **does apply** to tax-related matters where:

| Situation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| **Tax penalties** | May constitute "criminal charge" if sufficiently severe |
| **Tax fraud prosecution** | Criminal proceedings |
| **Civil claims arising from tax** | Recovery actions, compensation |
| **Tax disputes with private law elements** | Where civil rights engaged |

---

## 5. Article 14: Non-Discrimination

### 1. Structure of Article 14

Article 14 prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of Convention rights:

> *"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."*

**Key limitation:**
Article 14 is **not freestanding**—it must be invoked in conjunction with another Convention right (typically A1P1 for tax cases).

### 2. Application to Tax Discrimination

To establish a violation of Article 14 + A1P1:

1. **Ambit**: The tax measure must fall within the ambit of A1P1 (taxation does)
2. **Comparability**: Claimant must be in "relevantly similar position" to comparator
3. **Different treatment**: Must show differential treatment
4. **No justification**: Difference must lack objective and reasonable justification

**Justification test:**
- Does the distinction pursue a legitimate aim?
- Is there reasonable proportionality between means and aim?

### 3. Wide State Discretion

The ECtHR accords states **particularly wide discretion** in tax discrimination cases:

- Tax systems inherently involve classifications and distinctions
- Policy choices about who bears tax burden are for legislature
- Court reluctant to interfere with democratically determined tax policy
- Will only intervene where distinction "manifestly lacks reasonable foundation"

## 6. Article 8: Privacy and Tax Administration

### 1. Relevance to Tax

Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) may be engaged by:

| Tax Administration Activity | Privacy Concern |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Information gathering | Access to personal financial data |
| Exchange of information | Cross-border data sharing |
| Tax investigations | Searches, seizures |
| Automatic exchange (CRS) | Bulk data transfer |

### 2. Balancing Test

Interference with privacy must be:
- **In accordance with law**: Clear legal basis
- **Necessary in democratic society**: Pressing social need
- **Proportionate**: Balance between state interest and individual privacy

Exchange of information provisions (Chapter 7.2-7.3, Article 26 OECD MTC) must comply with these principles, though states generally have sufficient legal basis in treaty provisions.

---

## 7. Practical Implications for International Tax

### 1. Relationship with DTCs

ECHR principles may interact with DTC application:

| Issue | ECHR Relevance |
|-------|----------------|
| **Non-discrimination (Art 24 OECD MTC)** | Complements Article 14 ECHR but distinct standards |
| **Exchange of information (Art 26)** | Must respect privacy rights |
| **Mutual agreement (Art 25)** | Fair process considerations |
| **Retrospective treaty changes** | Legitimate expectation issues |

### 2. Limits on Tax Enforcement

ECHR provides outer limits on aggressive tax enforcement:

- Disproportionate penalties may violate A1P1
- Excessive confiscation may be challengeable
- Procedural fairness requirements (though limited by Ferrazzini)
- Data protection in cross-border information exchange

### 3. Link to Domestic Law Incorporation

ECHR relevance depends on:
- Whether ECHR incorporated into domestic law (e.g., UK Human Rights Act 1998)
- Direct applicability in national courts
- Availability of ECtHR petition after domestic remedies exhausted

## 9. Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Overstating ECHR impact on tax | ECHR rarely changes tax outcomes | Emphasise wide state discretion |
| Claiming Article 6 applies to tax | Ferrazzini excludes ordinary tax disputes | Know the Article 6 limitation |
| Treating Article 14 as freestanding | Must combine with substantive right | Always link to A1P1 |
| Missing taxation exception in A1P1 | Core feature of A1P1 | Quote second paragraph |
| Excessive case detail | Low-frequency topic | Focus on principles, not minutiae |
