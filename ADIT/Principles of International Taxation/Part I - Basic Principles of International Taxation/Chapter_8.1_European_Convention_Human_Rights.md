## Chapter 8.1: The European Convention on Human Rights

### 1. Human Rights and Taxation: The Fundamental Tension

Taxation involves the compulsory extraction of private property by the state. This reality creates an inherent tension between the state's need to raise revenue and the individual's right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions. Human rights instruments provide a framework for balancing these competing interests, though they generally accord states wide discretion in designing and implementing tax systems.

The fundamental tension manifests in several dimensions. Property rights require protection from arbitrary deprivation, yet taxation by definition involves taking property without individual consent. Equality principles demand non-discriminatory treatment, yet tax systems inherently create classifications and distinctions between different categories of taxpayers. Procedural fairness requires access to justice and fair hearings, yet efficient tax administration may favour expedient procedures over elaborate safeguards. Privacy protections limit government intrusion into personal affairs, yet effective tax enforcement requires access to financial information.

The European Convention on Human Rights addresses these tensions through provisions that recognise state power over taxation while establishing outer boundaries on its exercise. Understanding this framework is essential for appreciating the limits on state tax powers within the Council of Europe's forty-six member states.

### 2. The ECHR Framework

#### 2.1. The Convention Structure

The European Convention on Human Rights was adopted in 1950 and is administered by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Convention establishes a system of individual petition allowing persons within the jurisdiction of contracting states to bring complaints directly to the Court after exhausting domestic remedies. Judgments are binding on respondent states and have shaped human rights protection across Europe.

The Convention is supplemented by protocols adding additional rights to the original text. Protocol No. 1, adopted in 1952, is particularly significant for taxation because it establishes the protection of property. Protocol No. 12, though not widely ratified, provides a general prohibition of discrimination extending beyond the enjoyment of Convention rights specifically.

#### 2.2. Relevant Provisions

Four Convention provisions have particular relevance to taxation. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 protects property rights and is the most frequently invoked provision in tax cases. Article 14 prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of Convention rights and is typically invoked together with the property right in tax discrimination challenges. Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair trial, though its application to tax disputes is limited. Article 8 protects private and family life and has relevance to tax administration practices including information gathering and exchange.

### 3. Article 1, Protocol 1: Protection of Property

The property protection provision is central to understanding the relationship between human rights and taxation under the Convention.

#### 3.1. The Three Rules

Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 states that every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. No one shall be deprived of possessions except in the public interest and subject to conditions provided for by law and by general principles of international law. Critically, the second paragraph provides that the preceding provisions shall not impair the right of a state to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.

The Court has interpreted this provision as containing three distinct rules. The first rule establishes the general principle of peaceful enjoyment of possessions. The second rule addresses deprivation of possessions, requiring public interest justification and legality. The third rule—and this is the crucial point for taxation—expressly permits states to control property use and to secure the payment of taxes.

The taxation exception in the third rule fundamentally shapes the Convention's application to tax matters. Unlike other interferences with property that must be justified under the first or second rules, taxation benefits from an express recognition that states may enact and enforce laws securing tax payment. This does not mean that any tax measure is permissible, but it does mean that states enjoy substantial latitude in tax matters that they do not enjoy in other areas of property regulation.

#### 3.2. The Margin of Appreciation

The margin of appreciation doctrine pervades the Court's approach to tax cases. States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in implementing social and economic policies, and this extends emphatically to taxation. The Court has consistently held that national authorities are best placed to assess the political, economic, and social factors relevant to tax policy and that the Court will not second-guess these assessments unless they are manifestly without reasonable foundation.

This deference reflects practical recognition that tax systems involve complex trade-offs between competing objectives—revenue raising, redistribution, economic efficiency, administrative feasibility—that democratic institutions are better equipped to evaluate than an international court. The wide margin does not mean the Convention imposes no constraints, but it does mean that successful challenges to tax measures are rare and typically involve extreme circumstances rather than disagreements about policy choices.

#### 3.3. Key Case Law

National & Provincial Building Society v United Kingdom established important principles about retrospective taxation. The UK Parliament enacted legislation closing a tax loophole by retrospectively changing the rules for certain interest payments. Building societies challenged the retrospective operation as violating property rights. The Court rejected the challenge, holding that there is no general principle against retrospective taxation under the Convention. Where Parliament acts to correct a manifest deficiency in the law or to prevent exploitation of an unintended loophole, retrospective legislation is permissible provided it is not arbitrary.

Burden v United Kingdom addressed discrimination claims in tax matters. Two elderly sisters challenged UK inheritance tax rules that exempted transfers between married couples and civil partners but not transfers between cohabiting siblings. The Grand Chamber found no violation, holding that the sisters were not in a relevantly similar position to married couples or civil partners. Marriage and civil partnership involve legal consequences and mutual obligations that distinguish them from cohabiting siblings, and states retain discretion in determining how to tax transfers between different categories of persons.

M.A. and Others v Finland established that even within the wide margin, tax measures must not impose an excessive burden that fundamentally interferes with a taxpayer's financial position. There must be a reasonable balance between public interest and protection of individual rights. This proportionality requirement provides the outer boundary on what the taxation exception permits, though in practice the Court rarely finds that boundary exceeded.

### 4. Article 6: The Fair Trial Exclusion

Ferrazzini v Italy is a landmark decision establishing that the right to a fair trial does not apply to ordinary tax disputes. The applicant complained that Italian tax proceedings had taken fourteen years, violating the right to a hearing within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6. The Grand Chamber held, by a vote of eleven to six, that Article 6 does not apply to tax disputes because they do not involve the determination of civil rights and obligations or criminal charges within the meaning of the provision.

The Court reasoned that tax matters lie at the hard core of public authority prerogatives. The relationship between taxpayer and state is predominantly public rather than private in character. While tax disputes may have pecuniary consequences, this is not sufficient to bring them within the civil rights limb of Article 6. The public law character of the relationship between individual and state in tax matters predominates over any private law elements.

This exclusion is significant because it means taxpayers in Council of Europe member states cannot rely on the Convention to challenge unreasonable delay or procedural unfairness in tax proceedings. The contrast with EU law is notable: Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides a right to an effective remedy and fair trial that does extend to tax matters within the scope of EU law, offering stronger procedural protections for taxpayers in EU member states than the Convention provides.

The Ferrazzini exclusion is not absolute. Article 6 does apply to tax-related matters where criminal charges are at stake. Tax penalties of sufficient severity may constitute criminal charges even if classified as administrative under domestic law, and prosecution for tax fraud clearly engages the criminal limb of Article 6. Where civil rights are engaged alongside tax matters—for example, in civil recovery actions or compensation claims arising from tax disputes—Article 6 may also apply.

### 5. Article 14: Non-Discrimination in Tax Matters

Article 14 prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention, covering grounds including sex, race, colour, language, religion, national or social origin, property, birth, and other status. Importantly, Article 14 is not freestanding—it must be invoked in conjunction with another Convention right. In tax cases, this typically means combining Article 14 with the property right under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

To establish a discrimination violation in tax matters, an applicant must demonstrate that the tax measure falls within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol No. 1, which taxation inherently does. The applicant must show they are in a relevantly similar position to a comparator who receives different treatment. There must be differential treatment on one of the prohibited grounds or other status. Finally, the difference must lack objective and reasonable justification.

The justification inquiry asks whether the distinction pursues a legitimate aim and whether there is reasonable proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought. States enjoy a particularly wide margin in justifying tax distinctions because tax systems inherently involve classifications—between income levels, between types of income, between resident and non-resident taxpayers, between different family structures. The Court will only intervene where a distinction manifestly lacks reasonable foundation.

This approach means that discrimination challenges to tax measures face substantial hurdles. Different treatment of different categories—such as the inheritance tax distinction between married couples and cohabiting siblings in Burden—will typically be justified by reference to the different legal characteristics of those categories and the legislature's policy choices about how the tax burden should be distributed.

### 6. Article 8: Privacy and Tax Administration

The right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 has growing relevance to tax administration, particularly as automatic exchange of information has become a standard feature of international tax cooperation. Tax authorities routinely collect extensive personal financial information, and the development of common reporting standards has created systems for bulk cross-border data sharing that engage privacy concerns.

Article 8 interference must be in accordance with law, necessary in a democratic society for a legitimate aim, and proportionate. Tax collection and prevention of tax evasion are recognised legitimate aims. The question is typically whether the interference is proportionate and whether sufficient safeguards exist against arbitrary application.

Exchange of information provisions in tax treaties and multilateral instruments such as the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters generally provide sufficient legal basis for information exchange. States routinely satisfy the legality requirement through their treaty networks and domestic implementation legislation. Proportionality concerns focus on whether information requests are sufficiently targeted rather than constituting fishing expeditions, and whether adequate data protection safeguards exist for transmitted information.

### 7. Practical Implications for International Tax

The Convention's relevance to international tax practice is limited but not negligible. Article 24 of the OECD Model Tax Convention addresses non-discrimination in treaty context, providing detailed rules that complement but differ from Article 14 of the Convention. Exchange of information under Article 26 must respect privacy principles, though the broad international consensus on automatic exchange suggests states consider such measures proportionate to the legitimate aim of combating tax evasion. Enforcement measures must not be so excessive as to exceed the bounds of proportionality, though the wide margin means most enforcement falls within acceptable limits.

The Convention's primary function in tax matters is establishing outer boundaries rather than detailed rules. It prevents the most egregious exercises of state power—confiscatory taxation, manifestly arbitrary distinctions, excessive enforcement—while leaving states wide discretion over the design and implementation of their tax systems. Successful challenges are rare because most tax measures, however contested on policy grounds, fall within the substantial space the Convention allows for democratic choices about taxation.
