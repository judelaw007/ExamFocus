## A. CONCEPT FOUNDATION

### 1. What Are "Connecting Factors"?

**Connecting factors** (also called **nexus** or **tax links**) are the criteria states use to establish their right to tax a person or transaction. They create the legal connection between:
- A **taxing state** (the government asserting tax authority)
- A **taxpayer** (individual or entity)
- **Taxable income or property**

**Key Principle**: Without a valid connecting factor, a state has no legitimate basis to impose tax. International law requires a genuine link between the taxing state and the subject of taxation.

### 2. The Two Fundamental Categories

States claim taxing rights based on **two fundamentally different types of connection**:

| Category | Connection Type | What It Links | Typical Scope |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Personal Connection** | State ↔ Person | Residence, domicile, citizenship | Worldwide income |
| **Territorial Connection** | State ↔ Activity/Asset | Source, situs | Income/assets within territory |

**Exam Tip**: Most exam questions involve interaction between these two categories—typically a residence state taxing worldwide income while a source state taxes income arising in its territory, creating double taxation.

---

## B. PERSONAL CONNECTING FACTORS

### 1. Residence

**Definition**: Residence is the primary connecting factor used by most states to assert unlimited (worldwide) tax liability.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Determined under **domestic law** of each state (no universal definition)
- Creates liability to tax on **worldwide income** in most jurisdictions
- Article 4 OECD MTC provides **tie-breaker rules** for dual residence, but does not define residence itself

**How States Determine Residence**:

| Test Type | Common Criteria | Examples |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Physical presence** | Number of days in country | 183-day test (many countries) |
| **Permanent home** | Available dwelling place | UK statutory residence test |
| **Centre of vital interests** | Personal/economic ties | Family location, business interests |
| **Habitual abode** | Regular pattern of living | Where person normally lives |

**Treaty Definition (Article 4(1) OECD MTC)**:
> "The term 'resident of a Contracting State' means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature."

**Critical Point**: The treaty does NOT create an autonomous definition of residence—it refers back to domestic law while listing acceptable connecting factors.

### 2. Domicile

**Definition**: Domicile is a common law concept distinct from residence, referring to a person's **permanent home**—the place they consider their ultimate base.

**Key Distinctions from Residence**:

| Aspect | Residence | Domicile |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Determined by** | Physical facts (presence, accommodation) | Legal concept + intention |
| **Can have multiple?** | Yes (dual residence possible) | No (only one domicile at a time) |
| **Changes how?** | Relatively easily (move countries) | Difficult to change (requires intent + action) |
| **Acquired at birth?** | No | Yes (domicile of origin) |

**Three Types of Domicile**:
1. **Domicile of origin**: Acquired at birth (typically father's domicile)
2. **Domicile of dependence**: For minors/incapacitated persons
3. **Domicile of choice**: Acquired by residing in a place with intention to remain permanently

**Relevance to International Tax**:
- UK historically used domicile for inheritance tax and foreign income rules
- Article 4(1) OECD MTC lists "domicile" as an acceptable basis for tax residence
- Many civil law countries use domicile-like concepts (e.g., "fiscal domicile" in France)

### 3. Citizenship (Nationality)

**Definition**: Citizenship-based taxation imposes tax liability based on holding citizenship/nationality of a state, **regardless of where the person lives**.

**Global Practice**:

| Approach | Countries | Tax Consequence |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Full citizenship taxation** | USA, Eritrea | Citizens taxed on worldwide income regardless of residence |
| **Limited citizenship factors** | Hungary, Myanmar | Some citizenship-based elements |
| **Citizenship irrelevant** | Most countries (UK, Germany, France, etc.) | Only residence matters for tax |

**The US Exception**:
- US citizens must file and potentially pay US tax on worldwide income **even if living abroad permanently**
- Origins: Civil War era (1861) to prevent wealthy Americans avoiding tax by moving overseas
- Enforcement: IRS can cancel passports for tax debts exceeding $50,000
- Relief mechanisms: Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE), Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)

**Eritrea's Diaspora Tax**:
- 2% flat tax on citizens abroad
- Limited enforcement capacity (difficult to collect)
- Primarily enforced through passport renewal requirements

**Exam Application**: When a question involves US persons, always consider citizenship-based taxation as an additional layer creating potential triple taxation scenarios.

---

## C. TERRITORIAL CONNECTING FACTORS

### 1. Source

**Definition**: Source refers to the **geographic origin of income**—the place where economic activity generating the income occurs.

**Key Principle**: Source-based taxation allows a state to tax income **arising within its territory**, regardless of the taxpayer's residence.

**Common Source Rules by Income Type**:

| Income Type | Typical Source Rule | Treaty Article |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Employment income** | Where services performed | Article 15 |
| **Business profits** | Where PE located | Article 7 |
| **Dividends** | Where paying company resident | Article 10 |
| **Interest** | Where payer resident (or PE bearing interest) | Article 11 |
| **Royalties** | Where payer resident (or use occurs) | Article 12 |
| **Immovable property income** | Where property located (situs) | Article 6 |
| **Capital gains on shares** | Varies (company residence or asset location) | Article 13 |

**Source vs. Residence Interaction**:
```
EXAMPLE: UK Resident Earns German Employment Income
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UK (Residence State):
  → Claims tax on worldwide income (including German salary)
  → Connecting factor: Residence

Germany (Source State):
  → Claims tax on income from employment exercised in Germany
  → Connecting factor: Source (where services performed)

Result: Double taxation unless relieved by treaty
```

### 2. Situs

**Definition**: Situs means the **physical location** of property or assets for tax purposes. It determines which state has taxing rights over property-based income and gains.

**Key Principle**: The state where property is physically located (situs) has primary taxing rights over that property, regardless of the owner's residence.

**Situs Rules by Asset Type**:

| Asset Type | Situs Rule | Certainty |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Real estate (immovable property)** | Where physically located | Absolute certainty |
| **Tangible movable property** | Where physically located | Generally clear |
| **Shares/securities** | Where company incorporated OR where register kept | Can be complex |
| **Bank accounts** | Where branch holding account located | Generally clear |
| **Intangibles (IP, goodwill)** | Where registered OR where used | Often disputed |
| **Debts/receivables** | Where debtor resident | Can vary |

**Treaty Treatment of Situs (Article 6 OECD MTC)**:
> "Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property... situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

**Critical Point**: For immovable property, the **situs state always retains taxing rights**—this is one of the clearest and most universally accepted source rules.

---

## D. INTERACTION BETWEEN CONNECTING FACTORS

### 1. How Double Taxation Arises

Double taxation occurs when **multiple connecting factors apply simultaneously**:

```
SCENARIO: French Resident Owns UK Rental Property
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Connecting Factors Present:
  1. France: Residence → worldwide income taxation
  2. UK: Situs → income from UK property taxable in UK

Without Relief:
  Rental income: £50,000
  UK tax (situs): £10,000 (20%)
  French tax (residence): £15,000 (30%)
  Total tax: £25,000 (50% effective rate)

With Treaty Relief (France-UK DTA):
  UK retains taxing right (Article 6)
  France provides credit for UK tax paid
  Total tax: £15,000 (30% effective rate)
```

### 2. Hierarchy of Connecting Factors in Treaties

Treaties allocate taxing rights based on **which connecting factor takes priority**:

| Priority Level | Connecting Factor | Typical Treatment |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Highest** | Situs (immovable property) | Source state has exclusive or primary right |
| **High** | Source (employment, business) | Source state often has primary right, with limits |
| **Medium** | Source (passive income) | Limited source taxation (reduced WHT rates) |
| **Baseline** | Residence | Residence state taxes; provides relief for source tax |

### 3. Exam Application Framework

When analyzing any international tax scenario, systematically identify:

**Step 1**: What income/gain/property is involved?
**Step 2**: What connecting factors apply?
- Personal: Is taxpayer resident? Where? Domiciled? Citizen of which country?
- Territorial: Where is income sourced? Where is property located (situs)?

**Step 3**: Which states can claim taxing rights?
**Step 4**: Is there a treaty? How does it allocate rights?
**Step 5**: What relief mechanism applies?

## E. 15% DISCUSSION ENHANCEMENT

### Theoretical Framework: The Policy Rationale for Different Connecting Factors

#### The Benefits Principle and Residence

The use of residence as a connecting factor reflects the **benefits principle** of taxation—the idea that persons should contribute to the costs of government services they benefit from.

**Arguments for Residence-Based Taxation**:
1. **Benefits received**: Residents use public services (healthcare, infrastructure, security) and should fund them
2. **Ability to pay**: Residence state can assess total ability to pay based on worldwide income
3. **Administrative efficiency**: Residence state has information access and enforcement capability
4. **Horizontal equity**: All residents treated equally regardless of income source

**Challenges to Residence in the Digital Age**:
- Remote workers can reside anywhere while earning from another jurisdiction
- Digital nomads may lack clear residence under traditional tests
- Corporate residence (POEM) becomes uncertain with virtual board meetings
- High-net-worth individuals can manipulate residence through careful travel planning

#### The Sovereignty Principle and Source

Source-based taxation reflects **territorial sovereignty**—a state's right to tax economic activity within its borders.

**Arguments for Source-Based Taxation**:
1. **Territorial sovereignty**: States should tax value created within their territory
2. **Economic substance**: Tax where real economic activity occurs
3. **Developing country interests**: Source taxation benefits capital-importing countries
4. **Anti-avoidance**: Harder to shift actual economic activity than legal residence

**The UN vs. OECD Divide**:

| Model | Favours | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **OECD Model** | Residence state | Developed countries export capital; residence taxation protects their tax base |
| **UN Model** | Source state | Developing countries import capital; source taxation allows them to tax inward investment |

This explains why UN Model provisions often grant broader source-state taxing rights (e.g., Article 12A on fees for technical services).

#### The Evolution of "Nexus" Concepts

The concept of what constitutes sufficient nexus for taxation has evolved significantly:

**Traditional Nexus**: Physical presence (residence, PE, property location)
**Expanding Nexus**: Economic presence without physical footprint
**Future Nexus (Pillar One)**: Market presence and customer location

Pillar One's Amount A represents a fundamental shift—taxing rights allocated to market jurisdictions based on sales/revenue, regardless of physical presence. This challenges the traditional connecting factor framework that has underpinned international taxation for a century.

## G. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLE

### December 2024, Question 1 (25 marks)

**Question**:
> "You are required to evaluate whether 'residence' remains an effective nexus test for companies in the context of globalisation and the digital economy. Your answer should include a consideration of potential reforms and alternative approaches."

---

**Model Answer**:

**Introduction**

Residence has historically served as the primary connecting factor for asserting unlimited tax liability over companies. Under most domestic laws, a company resident in a jurisdiction is taxable on its worldwide income. However, globalisation and digitisation have challenged whether residence remains an effective nexus test. This answer evaluates residence as a corporate connecting factor and considers alternatives.

**Traditional Basis for Corporate Residence**

Corporate tax residence is typically determined by one of two tests:

1. **Place of incorporation**: Where the company is legally formed (common in US, UK)
2. **Place of effective management (POEM)**: Where key management decisions are made (used by Germany, many civil law countries)

Article 4(1) OECD MTC accepts both approaches, referring to "place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature."

The rationale for residence-based corporate taxation includes:
- The company benefits from the residence state's legal infrastructure
- The residence state can effectively enforce tax obligations
- Worldwide taxation with foreign tax credits promotes capital export neutrality

**Challenges from Globalisation and the Digital Economy**

Several developments have undermined residence as an effective corporate nexus:

**POEM Uncertainty**: With virtual board meetings and geographically dispersed management, determining where "effective management" occurs is increasingly arbitrary. Directors may meet in different locations, attend remotely, or delegate decisions to local managers. The 2017 OECD MTC acknowledged this by replacing the POEM tie-breaker with mutual agreement procedure for dual-resident entities.

**Incorporation Shopping**: Companies can incorporate in low-tax jurisdictions while conducting substantive business elsewhere. The ease of incorporating companies means the incorporation test can be manipulated.

**Digital Business Models**: Technology companies can generate substantial revenue from customers in a jurisdiction without any physical presence there. Traditional residence rules fail to capture this value creation.

**Stateless Income**: Sophisticated structures can result in income that is not effectively taxed anywhere—neither in the residence state (due to exemptions or deferrals) nor in the source state (due to lack of PE).

**Alternative Approaches and Potential Reforms**

Several alternatives to residence-based corporate taxation have been proposed or implemented:

**Formulary Apportionment**: Allocating profits based on factors like sales, employees, and assets. Used within the US for state taxation but faces challenges internationally due to disagreement on appropriate factors.

**Destination-Based Taxation**: Taxing profits where customers are located. Pillar One's Amount A partially implements this for the largest multinational enterprises, allocating a portion of residual profits to market jurisdictions.

**Significant Economic Presence**: BEPS Action 1 proposed nexus tests based on revenue thresholds, user numbers, or contract volumes—though this was not ultimately adopted in the 2015 BEPS package.

**Digital Services Taxes**: Unilateral measures taxing digital revenues in market jurisdictions, though these face challenges regarding treaty compatibility and potential double taxation.

**Conclusion**

Residence remains a necessary but insufficient connecting factor for corporate taxation. For the majority of businesses with genuine physical presence, residence-based taxation remains workable and appropriate. However, for highly mobile digital businesses, residence alone cannot ensure that profits are taxed where value is created.

The appropriate response is not to abandon residence but to supplement it with additional nexus concepts. Pillar One represents an evolution in this direction—retaining residence-based taxation as the baseline while allocating additional taxing rights to market jurisdictions for the largest multinational enterprises. The challenge lies in implementing such reforms consistently across the international tax system.

## I. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CONNECTING FACTORS - EXAM ESSENTIALS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TWO CATEGORIES: Personal (residence, domicile, citizenship)
   vs. Territorial (source, situs)

2. RESIDENCE: Primary personal nexus; determined by domestic
   law; creates worldwide tax liability; Article 4 OECD MTC

3. DOMICILE: Common law concept distinct from residence;
   permanent home with intent to remain; harder to change

4. CITIZENSHIP: Only USA and Eritrea tax based on citizenship
   regardless of residence

5. SOURCE: Where income originates; varies by income type;
   enables taxation without personal connection

6. SITUS: Physical location of property; situs state has
   primary taxing right over immovable property

7. DOUBLE TAXATION: Arises when multiple connecting factors
   apply simultaneously (residence + source)

8. TREATY ALLOCATION: Treaties allocate taxing rights based
   on which connecting factor takes priority
