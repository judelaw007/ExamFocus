# Chapter 3.1: Concepts of Source and Situs; Use of Residence, Domicile and Citizenship as Connecting Factors

## 1. Understanding Connecting Factors

Connecting factors—also termed nexus or fiscal links—represent the criteria states employ to establish their authority to impose tax on a person or transaction. These legal principles create the essential connection between a taxing state, a taxpayer, and taxable income or property. Without a valid connecting factor, a state possesses no legitimate basis under international law to assert taxing rights.

The concept of genuine connection derives from public international law principles articulated in cases such as the International Court of Justice's *Nottebohm* decision, which established that states may only exercise jurisdiction where a meaningful link exists between sovereign and subject. In taxation, this translates to requiring either a personal connection between the state and the taxpayer, or a territorial connection between the state and the economic activity or asset generating the income.

### 1.1. The Two Fundamental Categories

States claim taxing rights based on two fundamentally different types of connection. **Personal connecting factors** link the state to the person—typically through residence, domicile, or citizenship—and generally result in unlimited tax liability on worldwide income. **Territorial connecting factors** link the state to the economic activity or asset through source or situs rules, resulting in limited taxation of income or property within the state's territory regardless of the taxpayer's personal status.

Most international tax questions involve the interaction between these two categories. A residence state typically taxes worldwide income while a source state taxes income arising within its territory, creating the potential for juridical double taxation that treaties seek to relieve.

## 2. Personal Connecting Factors

### 2.1. Residence

Residence serves as the primary connecting factor used by the overwhelming majority of states to assert unlimited tax liability. A person resident in a jurisdiction is typically subject to tax on worldwide income from all sources.

The critical feature of residence for international tax purposes is that no universal definition exists. Each state determines residence under its own domestic law, leading to significant variation in approach. Article 4(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention does not create an autonomous definition but rather refers back to domestic law, providing that "the term 'resident of a Contracting State' means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature."

States employ various tests to determine individual residence. **Physical presence tests** count days spent within the jurisdiction—the 183-day rule appears in many domestic laws and in Article 15 of the OECD Model for employment income allocation. The **permanent home test** examines whether an individual maintains an available dwelling, while the **centre of vital interests** test considers where personal and economic ties are strongest. Many jurisdictions combine these elements, as illustrated by the United Kingdom's Statutory Residence Test introduced in 2013, which employs automatic tests based on presence and connection factors.

Corporate residence presents distinct challenges. The **place of incorporation test** treats a company as resident where it is legally formed—straightforward to administer but vulnerable to manipulation. The **place of effective management** (POEM) test looks to where key management and commercial decisions are actually made. Germany and many civil law jurisdictions favour POEM, while the United States and traditionally the United Kingdom emphasise incorporation. The 2017 revision to the OECD Model acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding corporate residence by replacing the POEM tie-breaker rule with a requirement for competent authority mutual agreement where dual residence arises.

### 2.2. Domicile

Domicile represents a distinct common law concept referring to an individual's permanent home—the place they consider their ultimate base and intend to return to. Unlike residence, which depends primarily on physical facts, domicile involves a legal determination incorporating intention.

Three types of domicile exist. **Domicile of origin** is acquired at birth, typically following the father's domicile. **Domicile of dependence** applies to minors and incapacitated persons who take the domicile of the person upon whom they depend. **Domicile of choice** may be acquired by an adult who establishes residence in a new jurisdiction with the intention of remaining permanently. Critically, a person can have only one domicile at any time, whereas multiple residences are entirely possible.

The distinction carries significant practical consequences. Under traditional United Kingdom rules, non-domiciled individuals resident in the UK could claim the remittance basis of taxation, paying UK tax on foreign income only when remitted to the UK. This regime created substantial planning opportunities for internationally mobile individuals. Domicile also determines inheritance tax liability on worldwide assets. Although reforms announced in 2024 will replace domicile with a residence-based system for most purposes, the concept remains embedded in the UK's statutory framework and continues to appear in Article 4(1) of the OECD Model as an acceptable basis for claiming residence state status.

### 2.3. Citizenship

Citizenship-based taxation imposes liability based on holding nationality of a state, regardless of where the person resides or where income arises. This approach remains exceptional in global practice.

The **United States** stands as the most significant practitioner of citizenship-based taxation. US citizens must file tax returns and potentially pay US tax on worldwide income even if they have lived abroad for decades with no intention of returning. The practice originated during the Civil War era to prevent wealthy Americans from avoiding tax by relocating overseas. Enforcement mechanisms include the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which requires foreign financial institutions to report accounts held by US persons, and the ability to revoke passports for tax debts exceeding $62,000. Relief mechanisms—the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion and Foreign Tax Credit—mitigate but do not eliminate the compliance burden on Americans abroad.

**Eritrea** imposes a 2% diaspora tax on citizens living abroad, though enforcement capacity remains limited and collection often occurs through consular services when citizens renew passports or require government documents.

The vast majority of states reject citizenship as a connecting factor, viewing residence as the appropriate basis for determining personal tax liability. This reflects the understanding that tax obligations should correspond to the state where a person actually lives and benefits from public services, rather than formal legal status that may bear little relationship to current circumstances.

## 3. Territorial Connecting Factors

### 3.1. Source

Source refers to the geographic origin of income—the place where economic activity generating the income occurs. Source-based taxation allows a state to tax income arising within its territory regardless of the taxpayer's residence, reflecting the principle that states possess sovereignty over economic activity within their borders.

Source rules vary by income type. **Employment income** is generally sourced where services are physically performed, regardless of where the employer is located or payment is made. **Business profits** are sourced where a permanent establishment exists—the threshold requiring a fixed place of business or dependent agent through which the enterprise conducts its activities. **Passive income** follows different patterns: dividends are typically sourced where the paying company is resident, interest where the payer is resident or where the permanent establishment bearing the interest is located, and royalties where the payer is resident or the intellectual property is used.

Treaty provisions allocate taxing rights based on source. Article 7 permits the source state to tax business profits only where attributable to a permanent establishment. Articles 10, 11, and 12 permit limited source-state taxation of dividends, interest, and royalties through reduced withholding rates. The UN Model provides broader source-state taxing rights than the OECD Model, reflecting the interests of capital-importing developing countries in taxing inward investment.

### 3.2. Situs

Situs denotes the physical location of property for tax purposes, determining which state possesses taxing rights over property-based income and capital gains. The situs state typically retains taxing rights regardless of the owner's residence.

**Immovable property** presents the clearest case—real estate is situated where physically located, and Article 6 of the OECD Model grants the situs state unrestricted taxing rights over income from such property. This rule enjoys universal acceptance and admits no exception.

Other asset types present greater complexity. **Tangible movable property** generally follows physical location. **Shares and securities** may be treated as situated where the company is incorporated, where the share register is maintained, or where the certificates are physically held—approaches vary between jurisdictions. **Intangible property** such as intellectual property or goodwill may be situated where registered, where used, or where the owner is resident depending on the jurisdiction and context. **Bank accounts** typically take their situs from the branch location where the account is held.

Article 13 of the OECD Model addresses capital gains, generally preserving situs-state taxing rights for immovable property and shares deriving value primarily from such property, while allocating gains on other property to the residence state.

## 4. Interaction and Policy Foundations

### 4.1. How Connecting Factors Create Double Taxation

Juridical double taxation arises when multiple connecting factors apply simultaneously to the same income. A French resident owning UK rental property faces taxation in the UK (situs-based) and France (residence-based) on the same rental income. Without treaty relief, the combined tax burden could exceed what either state would impose domestically.

Treaties resolve such conflicts by allocating taxing rights between residence and source states. Where the source state retains taxing rights—as with immovable property income—the residence state must provide relief, typically through credit for foreign tax paid or exemption of the foreign income.

### 4.2. Policy Foundations

**Residence-based taxation** reflects the benefits principle—residents use public services and should contribute to their cost. The residence state can assess total ability to pay based on worldwide income and possesses administrative capacity to enforce obligations against persons within its jurisdiction.

**Source-based taxation** reflects territorial sovereignty—states possess the right to tax value created within their borders. This principle supports developing country interests, as capital-importing states can only effectively tax foreign investors through source rules. The tension between residence and source perspectives explains the differences between the OECD Model (favouring residence states, reflecting developed country interests) and the UN Model (granting broader source-state rights, reflecting developing country concerns).

### 4.3. Evolution in the Digital Economy

Traditional connecting factors assumed physical presence—residents lived somewhere, businesses operated through fixed establishments, property existed in identifiable locations. Digital business models challenge these assumptions. Companies can generate substantial revenue from customers in jurisdictions where they maintain no physical presence, avoiding both residence and source-state taxation under traditional rules.

The OECD/G20 Pillar One response partially addresses this gap by allocating taxing rights to market jurisdictions based on sales revenue for the largest multinational enterprises, regardless of physical presence. This represents a fundamental evolution in nexus concepts—supplementing residence and traditional source with market presence as a basis for taxation.

Whether residence remains an effective nexus test for companies in this changed environment has become a central question in international tax policy (covered in December 2024). The consensus emerging from policy discussions suggests that residence remains necessary but insufficient—appropriate for most businesses with genuine physical presence, yet inadequate for highly digitalised enterprises generating value through customer relationships and data rather than traditional factors of production. The traditional connecting factor framework, while remaining foundational, no longer provides complete answers to twenty-first century business realities. Understanding these classical concepts remains essential, however, as they continue to govern the vast majority of cross-border transactions and provide the baseline against which reforms are measured.
