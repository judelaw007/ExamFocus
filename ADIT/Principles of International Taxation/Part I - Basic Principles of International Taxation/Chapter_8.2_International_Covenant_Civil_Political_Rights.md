## Chapter 8.2: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

### 1. The ICCPR in Context

#### 1.1. Overview of the Covenant

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 December 1966 and entering into force on 23 March 1976. With 175 states parties as of 2025, the Covenant represents the most widely adopted binding international instrument protecting civil and political rights. The Human Rights Committee, a body of independent experts, monitors implementation and considers individual complaints brought under the First Optional Protocol.

The ICCPR forms part of the International Bill of Human Rights alongside the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. While the Universal Declaration established aspirational standards, the ICCPR creates binding legal obligations for states parties regarding the protection of civil and political rights.

#### 1.2. Relationship to Other Instruments

The ICCPR operates at the global level, distinguishing it from regional instruments like the European Convention on Human Rights. This distinction matters for taxation because the ICCPR's non-discrimination provisions differ significantly from the ECHR's approach. Where the ECHR applies to the 46 Council of Europe member states, the ICCPR's near-universal membership of 175 states gives it much broader geographical reach.

The relationship between global and regional instruments raises questions about which standards apply when both are relevant. For Council of Europe states, both the ECHR and ICCPR apply, potentially offering different routes for challenging discriminatory tax measures. The key practical difference lies in enforcement: the European Court of Human Rights delivers binding judgments, while the Human Rights Committee issues non-binding Views that states are expected to implement in good faith.

### 2. Key Provisions Relevant to Taxation

#### 2.1. Article 2: Accessory Non-Discrimination

Article 2(1) of the ICCPR requires each state party to respect and ensure to all individuals within its territory the rights recognised in the Covenant without distinction based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, political opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status. This provision establishes a non-discrimination obligation, but its scope is limited.

Article 2 operates as an accessory provision, meaning it prohibits discrimination only in relation to rights already protected by the ICCPR itself. Since the Covenant does not include taxation among the civil and political rights it protects, Article 2 alone cannot ground a claim of tax discrimination. A complainant invoking Article 2 must identify another Covenant right that is being enjoyed discriminatorily. For tax purposes, this limitation significantly restricts Article 2's utility.

#### 2.2. Article 26: Autonomous Non-Discrimination

Article 26 provides that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. It requires that the law prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status.

The critical feature of Article 26 is its autonomous character. Unlike Article 2, which applies only to rights within the Covenant, Article 26 provides a freestanding right to non-discrimination extending to all legislation enacted by the state. This means tax law falls directly within Article 26's scope. A discriminatory tax provision can be challenged under Article 26 without needing to demonstrate a connection to any other Covenant right.

This autonomous nature represents the most significant difference between the ICCPR and ECHR approaches to tax discrimination. Under the ECHR, Article 14's non-discrimination protection is accessory—it can only be invoked in conjunction with another Convention right, typically the right to peaceful enjoyment of property under Article 1 of Protocol 1. The ICCPR's Article 26, by contrast, applies directly to any discriminatory legislation, including tax law, without requiring such linkage.

### 3. The Human Rights Committee

#### 3.1. Role and Function

The Human Rights Committee is the treaty body responsible for monitoring ICCPR implementation. It comprises eighteen independent experts elected by states parties, serving in their personal capacity rather than as government representatives. The Committee performs several functions: reviewing periodic reports from states parties on their implementation efforts, issuing General Comments that provide authoritative interpretations of Covenant provisions, and considering individual communications under the First Optional Protocol.

The First Optional Protocol enables individuals in states that have ratified it to bring complaints directly to the Committee. The complainant must have exhausted domestic remedies and the same matter must not be under examination by another international procedure. The Committee examines admissible communications and issues Views setting out whether the Covenant has been violated. These Views, while not technically legally binding in the manner of court judgments, carry significant interpretive authority and states are expected to implement them in good faith.

#### 3.2. General Comment No. 18

The Human Rights Committee's General Comment No. 18, adopted in 1989, provides the authoritative interpretation of the Covenant's non-discrimination provisions. The Comment defines discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on prohibited grounds that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise of rights on an equal footing.

Crucially, General Comment No. 18 confirms that Article 26's application is not limited to rights provided for in the Covenant. Where a state enacts legislation in any field, that legislation must comply with Article 26. This interpretation explicitly extends the non-discrimination guarantee to areas including taxation and social security, confirming that discriminatory tax provisions fall within the Committee's jurisdiction.

The Comment also establishes that not every differentiation constitutes discrimination. Differentiation is permissible if based on reasonable and objective criteria and if pursuing a legitimate aim. This formulation creates the analytical framework the Committee applies when assessing whether challenged measures violate Article 26.

### 4. Application to Taxation

#### 4.1. Landmark Cases: Broeks and Zwaan-de Vries

The 1987 cases of Broeks v Netherlands and Zwaan-de Vries v Netherlands established definitively that Article 26 applies to taxation and social security legislation. Both cases involved married women denied unemployment benefits unless they proved they were the family breadwinner, while married men received benefits without such proof.

The Netherlands Government initially argued that Article 26 could only be invoked for civil and political rights matters, not economic or social legislation. However, the Government notably conceded that it could envisage the admissibility of a complaint concerning discrimination in the field of taxation, effectively acknowledging that tax discrimination claims fall within Article 26's scope.

The Human Rights Committee found violations in both cases. It held that Article 26 applies to all legislation, not merely to civil and political rights matters. Where a state chooses to legislate—whether in social security, taxation, or any other field—that legislation must comply with Article 26's non-discrimination requirement. The sex-based distinction in the unemployment benefit rules lacked reasonable and objective justification, constituting discrimination.

These cases remain foundational because they established the autonomous reach of Article 26 beyond the Covenant's subject matter. The principle that any legislation must comply with non-discrimination requirements applies regardless of whether the legislation concerns rights enumerated in the ICCPR.

#### 4.2. The Reasonable and Objective Test

The analytical framework for assessing Article 26 claims involves several steps. First, the Committee determines whether differential treatment exists. Tax systems inherently involve classifications—residents versus non-residents, different treatment of income types, progressive rate structures—so differential treatment is typically present.

Second, the Committee considers whether the differential treatment is based on a prohibited ground. Article 26's list—including race, sex, religion, national origin, property, and other status—is illustrative rather than exhaustive. Tax classifications based on nationality, residence status, or economic characteristics may engage Article 26 if they correlate with protected grounds.

Third, and most significantly, the Committee assesses whether the differential treatment is based on reasonable and objective criteria pursuing a legitimate aim. This is where most tax discrimination claims fail. States enjoy wide discretion in formulating tax policy, and the Committee recognises that legitimate aims including revenue collection, economic management, and social policy can justify differential treatment. Only arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable distinctions are likely to constitute violations.

#### 4.3. Tax Cases Before the Committee

Several tax-related communications have reached the Human Rights Committee following the Broeks and Zwaan-de Vries precedent. In Sprenger v Netherlands, differential tax treatment of married and unmarried couples was challenged but found not to violate Article 26 because the distinction pursued legitimate policy objectives. In Danning v Netherlands, similar reasoning led to no finding of violation where reasonable justification existed for the challenged tax rules.

The pattern emerging from these cases shows the Committee accepting jurisdiction over tax discrimination claims but according states substantial latitude in tax policy design. The reasonable and objective test is applied deferentially, with the Committee reluctant to second-guess policy choices that fall within the range of what reasonable legislators might adopt. Success in tax discrimination claims before the Committee remains rare.

### 5. Comparison with ECHR Approach

The distinction between ICCPR Article 26 and ECHR Article 14 merits emphasis because it represents the fundamental difference in how these instruments address tax discrimination. ECHR Article 14 is accessory, prohibiting discrimination only in the enjoyment of Convention rights. To challenge discriminatory tax measures under the ECHR, a complainant must link the claim to another right—typically the property right under Article 1 of Protocol 1. This requirement adds complexity and may limit the range of challengeable measures.

ICCPR Article 26 operates autonomously, applying directly to any legislation. No linkage to another Covenant right is required. Tax legislation can be challenged simply on the ground that it discriminates, without needing to characterise the tax as affecting property rights or any other protected interest. *(covered in June 2023)*

Despite this structural difference, practical outcomes under both instruments show similar patterns. Both the European Court of Human Rights and the Human Rights Committee accord states wide discretion in tax matters. Both apply proportionality or reasonableness analysis that typically favours state justifications. Both produce very low success rates for tax discrimination challenges. The theoretical advantage of Article 26's autonomous character has not translated into significantly different practical outcomes.

Enforcement mechanisms differ significantly. European Court judgments are binding and enforceable through the Council of Europe's execution process. Human Rights Committee Views, while authoritative, lack formal binding force and depend on state good faith for implementation. For complainants seeking effective remedy, this difference may outweigh the theoretical advantage of Article 26's broader scope.

### 6. Practical Relevance for International Tax

The practical impact of ICCPR Article 26 on international taxation remains limited for several reasons. The Human Rights Committee's Views are not enforceable in the manner of court judgments, reducing incentives for compliance. The wide margin of appreciation accorded to states in tax policy means most claims are rejected as justified differentiation. The requirement to exhaust domestic remedies before approaching the Committee adds delay. The overall success rate for tax discrimination claims is very low.

The ICCPR's global membership does provide broader jurisdictional reach than the regional ECHR, potentially offering recourse for taxpayers in states outside Europe. However, the practical utility of this broader reach is constrained by the enforcement limitations.

The relationship between ICCPR Article 26 and treaty-based non-discrimination provisions such as OECD Model Tax Convention Article 24 deserves note. These operate in different spheres—Article 26 addresses general human rights protections while Article 24 addresses specific nationality discrimination between treaty partners—but may overlap in particular cases. The remedies and enforcement mechanisms differ substantially, with treaty-based provisions typically offering more practical paths to resolution through mutual agreement procedures.

Finally, practitioners should note that "Article 26" in international tax discussions usually refers to the OECD Model Tax Convention provision on exchange of information, not ICCPR Article 26. Context determines which instrument is relevant. The ICCPR's non-discrimination provision has limited direct application in routine international tax practice, though it remains part of the broader legal framework within which tax systems operate.
