## Chapter 4.1: Causes of International Double Taxation - Conflicts of Residence and Source

### 1. Defining International Double Taxation

#### 1.1. The Four Essential Elements

International juridical double taxation arises when the same income or capital is taxed in the hands of the same taxpayer by two or more states for the same period in respect of the same subject matter. This definition, derived from the OECD Model Tax Convention Commentary, contains four essential elements that must all be present: the same taxpayer must be subject to tax; the same item of income or capital must be taxed; taxation must occur in respect of the same taxable period; and two or more states must impose the tax.

The phenomenon occurs because no rule of public international law prevents states from asserting overlapping tax claims. Each sovereign state determines its own tax jurisdiction independently, defining residence, source, and other connecting factors according to its domestic law. These independently determined claims frequently overlap in cross-border situations. The absence of a supranational tax authority means there is no automatic mechanism to eliminate these overlapping claims, which explains why bilateral tax treaties and unilateral relief measures developed as the primary tools for addressing double taxation.

#### 1.2. Juridical and Economic Double Taxation Distinguished

The distinction between juridical and economic double taxation is fundamental to understanding how treaty relief mechanisms operate.

Juridical double taxation occurs when the same person is taxed on the same income by two states. The classic example is a UK resident earning rental income from property in Germany: the UK taxes the income under its worldwide taxation principle, while Germany taxes the same income as arising from German-situs property. The same taxpayer faces two tax liabilities on identical income.

Economic double taxation occurs when the same income is taxed in the hands of different persons. The paradigm case is dividend income: a subsidiary company pays corporate tax on its profits, and the shareholder then pays personal tax on dividends received from those already-taxed profits. Two different taxpayers bear tax, but on economically identical income.

The OECD Model Tax Convention and bilateral treaties primarily address juridical double taxation. The Commentary on Articles 23A and 23B explicitly states that these provisions deal with juridical double taxation, "which is to be distinguished from so-called economic double taxation." While some treaty provisions and domestic participation exemptions address economic double taxation, the treaty relief framework focuses on eliminating situations where the same taxpayer pays tax twice on the same income.

### 2. Types of Jurisdictional Conflicts

International double taxation arises from three distinct types of jurisdictional conflicts, each requiring different resolution mechanisms.

#### 2.1. Residence-Source Conflicts

The residence-source conflict is the most common cause of international double taxation. It arises when a residence state claims the right to tax a person's worldwide income while a source state simultaneously claims the right to tax income arising within its territory.

Most developed countries assert worldwide taxation over their residents based on the benefit theory—residents benefit from state services wherever they earn income and should therefore contribute to state revenue on their total economic gains. These same countries also claim source-based taxation over income arising within their borders based on the origin theory—income should be taxed where the economic activity generating it occurs, reflecting the contribution of local infrastructure, markets, and legal systems to income production.

When a taxpayer resident in one state earns income with its source in another, both claims overlap. A German resident performing consulting services in Japan illustrates this conflict: Germany taxes the income as part of the resident's worldwide earnings, while Japan taxes it as income from services performed on Japanese territory. The same income faces taxation twice, creating juridical double taxation. *(covered in June 2022)*

The treaty framework addresses this conflict through a two-step mechanism. First, distributive rules in Articles 6-22 allocate taxing rights between states, determining which may tax each income category and whether that right is exclusive or shared. Second, where both states retain taxing rights, the residence state must provide relief under Articles 23A or 23B.

#### 2.2. Residence-Residence Conflicts

A residence-residence conflict arises when two states both consider the same person to be their tax resident. This typically occurs because states use different domestic law definitions of residence.

One state may determine individual residence based on physical presence, treating anyone present for more than 183 days as resident. Another may focus on the location of a permanent home or centre of vital interests. A third may use citizenship or domicile as connecting factors. A person may satisfy the residence tests of multiple states simultaneously, with each claiming the right to tax worldwide income.

Corporate residence conflicts arise similarly. Some states determine corporate residence by place of incorporation, others by place of effective management, and still others by a combination of factors. A company incorporated in one state but managed from another may be resident in both under their respective domestic laws. *(covered in June 2024)*

Article 4(2) of the OECD Model provides tie-breaker rules for individuals to determine a single residence for treaty purposes. The tie-breaker operates hierarchically: permanent home; centre of vital interests (if homes in both states); habitual abode; nationality; and finally mutual agreement procedure if none of these tests resolves the matter. For companies, Article 4(3) originally specified place of effective management as the tie-breaker, though the 2017 update replaced this with case-by-case determination through competent authority agreement.

#### 2.3. Source-Source Conflicts

A source-source conflict occurs when two states both consider the same income to have its source within their territory. This arises because there is no universally agreed definition of source, and states apply different sourcing rules to the same income types.

Interest may be sourced where the debtor is resident, where the capital is employed, or where the loan agreement was concluded. Royalties may be sourced where the payer is resident, where the intellectual property is used, or where the licence was granted. Services income may be sourced where services are performed, where the payer is located, or where the benefit of services is received.

These conflicting source rules create situations where the same income is treated as domestically sourced by multiple states, each asserting source-state taxing rights. Treaty distributive rules typically define source for treaty purposes, overriding conflicting domestic definitions between treaty partners and establishing which state's source claim prevails.

### 3. The Treaty Framework for Resolution

#### 3.1. Distributive Rules: Allocating Taxing Rights

The OECD Model Tax Convention addresses jurisdictional conflicts through distributive rules in Articles 6-22. These provisions determine which state may tax each category of income and whether that right is exclusive or shared with the other state.

Some articles allocate exclusive taxing rights. Article 7 provides that business profits are taxable only in the residence state unless the enterprise carries on business through a permanent establishment in the source state. Article 12 (in the OECD Model) provides that royalties are taxable only in the residence state. Article 21 similarly allocates other income exclusively to the residence state.

Other articles permit shared taxation with limits. Article 10 provides that dividends may be taxed in both residence and source states, but limits source-state taxation to 5% for substantial corporate shareholders and 15% for other recipients. Article 11 permits source-state taxation of interest but typically limits it to 10%. Article 6 permits the source state to tax immovable property income without limitation. *(covered in December 2023)*

The treaty language "may be taxed" is permissive rather than mandatory. When an article states that income may be taxed in a particular state, it allocates the right to tax under the treaty but does not compel that state to exercise the right. Whether taxation actually occurs depends on the state's domestic legislation.

#### 3.2. Relief Methods: Exemption and Credit

Where both states retain taxing rights after applying the distributive rules, the residence state must provide relief to eliminate remaining double taxation. Articles 23A and 23B offer two principal methods.

Under the exemption method (Article 23A), the residence state excludes foreign income from its tax base. The income taxed at source is not taxed again in the residence state. Most countries using exemption apply it "with progression"—the exempt income is included when calculating the applicable tax rate on remaining income but is not itself taxed. This prevents taxpayers from benefiting from lower marginal rates on their domestic income by excluding foreign income from rate calculations.

Under the credit method (Article 23B), the residence state taxes worldwide income but allows a credit for foreign tax paid. The residence state calculates tax on total income, then deducts the foreign tax, typically limited to the residence state's own tax on that foreign income. This "ordinary credit" ensures the residence state receives at least its normal tax rate while preventing double taxation. Some treaties provide "full credit" without limitation, though this is rare as it may result in negative effective tax on domestic income.

The choice between methods reflects different policy priorities. The exemption method promotes capital import neutrality: foreign and domestic investors in a source country face the same tax rate, as the foreign investor bears only source-state tax. The credit method promotes capital export neutrality: a country's residents face the same effective tax burden regardless of where they invest, as the residence state ensures its rate applies even when foreign rates are lower. Neither approach fully eliminates distortions, and hybrid approaches combining elements of both methods are common in practice.

### 4. Policy Considerations

#### 4.1. Historical Development

The current framework for resolving residence-source conflicts emerged from international negotiations beginning in the 1920s. The League of Nations' 1927 Report established the principle that both residence and source states have legitimate taxing claims and proposed a system of shared allocation. The 1928 Model Conventions that followed remain the foundation of modern treaty practice.

Different drafts reflected different priorities. The 1943 Mexico Draft favoured source-state taxation, reflecting developing country interests in taxing economic activity within their borders. The 1946 London Draft shifted toward residence-state primacy, reflecting capital-exporting countries' preferences. The 1963 OECD Model represented a durable compromise, though critics note it favours residence-state taxation for most income types.

#### 4.2. Continuing Tensions

The balance between residence and source taxation remains contested. The UN Model Tax Convention addresses developing country concerns by permitting higher withholding rates on passive income, providing for source taxation of technical service fees under Article 12A, and adopting broader permanent establishment definitions to increase source-state taxing rights.

Digital economy developments have intensified these tensions. Traditional source rules assume physical presence creates economic nexus, but digital businesses can generate substantial revenue from customers in a country without any physical presence there. The OECD/G20 Pillar One framework responds by reallocating some taxing rights to market jurisdictions regardless of physical presence, representing a partial shift from traditional residence-source allocation toward market-based taxation for the largest multinational enterprises.

These developments suggest that while the residence-source framework remains foundational, it continues to evolve as the limitations of traditional connecting factors become more apparent in a globalised, digitalised economy.
