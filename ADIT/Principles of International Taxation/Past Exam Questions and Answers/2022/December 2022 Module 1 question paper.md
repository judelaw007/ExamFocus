PART B You are required to answer AT LEAST ONE question from this Part.

6. Algero is a multinational entity with operations around the globe, including in Country B.

Algero is resident for domestic law purposes in Country A, on the basis that it:

(i) has a management team who are all resident in Algero and make all of Algero’s key commercial

decisions, and (ii) is recognised as a separate legal entity for tax and company law purposes under the laws of Country A.

In addition to the management team, Algero has six directors, who live in various countries around the world.

One of the directors is a resident in Country A and another in Country B, with the remaining directors living in other countries. The directors meet twice per year in different locations, with the meetings occasionally taking place in Country A or Country B. If directors are unable to attend a meeting in person, they attend remotely via teleconference from their respective countries of residence. The directors and the management team are two separate bodies of persons which have different roles within Algero; the directors sign off on decisions reached by the management team.

Algero is also a tax resident under the domestic law of Country B, due to its incorporation there. Algero’s contracts are governed by the law of Country B and its headquarters are also in Country B.

The double tax agreement (DTA) between Country A and Country B is a covered tax agreement that also mirrors the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017, Article 4.

You are required to:

1) Prepare a memo outlining the residence status of Algero, for the purposes of the Country A/Country B DTA. (20) 2) Consider how the situation might change, were Country A or Country B to introduce rules into their domestic tax law to provide an exemption from taxation for the foreign source income of certain foreign companies. (5) Total (25) 7. The government of Salia is concerned that its double taxation agreement network may not sufficiently protect

its source state taxing rights in relation to the business profits of overseas entities.

The various double taxation agreements in Salia’s network all include a provision that mirrors Article 5 of the OECD Model Tax Convention 2014. Salia has neither signed nor ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the MLI).

You are required to prepare a report that:

1) Outlines, at a general level, the changes made to the definition of ‘permanent establishment’ in the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 (OECD MTC 2017). (10) 2) Summarises how Salia’s source state taxing rights may change if its double taxation agreement network were to include provisions that mirror Article 5 of the OECD MTC 2017. (5) 3) Considers Article 5 of the OECD MTC 2017 as it relates to commissionaire arrangements. (10) Total (25)
