## Chapter 1.1: Unitary Taxation and Global Formulary Apportionment

### 1. The Concept of Unitary Taxation

#### 1.1. Definition and Core Principles

Unitary taxation represents a fundamentally different approach to taxing multinational enterprises compared to the separate entity principle that underpins most international tax systems. Under unitary taxation, a group of related companies is treated as a single, integrated business entity for tax purposes, rather than as a collection of distinct legal entities. This approach recognizes that multinational enterprises often operate as cohesive global businesses where subsidiaries in different jurisdictions perform interdependent functions contributing to the overall profitability of the group.

The concept originated in the United States at the state level, where states sought to tax their fair share of income from companies operating across multiple state borders. Because separate accounting for each state operation could lead to manipulation and profit shifting to low-tax states, several jurisdictions adopted the unitary business principle. This principle holds that when business operations are sufficiently integrated and interdependent, the income of the entire enterprise should be calculated on a combined basis and then apportioned to each taxing jurisdiction according to a predetermined formula.

#### 1.2. The Apportionment Formula

Global formulary apportionment (GFA) extends the unitary taxation concept to the international level. Under GFA, the worldwide profits of a multinational group are first calculated on a consolidated basis, eliminating all intercompany transactions. These consolidated profits are then allocated among jurisdictions where the group operates according to a mathematical formula based on objective factors representing the group's economic presence in each location.

The most commonly referenced apportionment formula is the three-factor formula, sometimes called the Massachusetts formula after the US state that pioneered its use. This formula allocates profits based on equal weighting of three factors: sales revenue, tangible assets, and payroll costs. Under a three-factor formula with equal weighting, a jurisdiction hosting 30% of the group's sales, 20% of its assets, and 25% of its payroll would receive an allocation of 25% of the group's consolidated profits. Some jurisdictions have modified this approach by using different weightings or additional factors, such as double-weighting sales to favour market jurisdictions over production locations.

#### 1.3. Contrast with the Arm's Length Principle

The contrast between formulary apportionment and the arm's length principle (ALP) could not be more stark. The ALP, which forms the foundation of international transfer pricing rules, requires each entity within a multinational group to be treated as if it were an independent enterprise dealing at arm's length with related parties. Under this approach, profits are allocated based on the functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed by each separate entity, with intercompany transactions priced as if they occurred between unrelated parties.

Formulary apportionment abandons this transaction-by-transaction analysis entirely. Instead of scrutinizing the pricing of intellectual property licenses, management fees, or intragroup financing arrangements, GFA simply ignores these internal transactions as economically meaningless transfers within a unified business. The allocation of profits depends solely on the distribution of formula factors, not on the characterization or pricing of specific transactions.

### 2. The OECD Position on Formulary Apportionment

#### 2.1. Endorsement of the Arm's Length Principle

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has consistently and firmly rejected global formulary apportionment as a viable alternative to the arm's length principle. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which represent the international consensus on transfer pricing matters among developed economies, explicitly address this issue in paragraph 1.16. The Guidelines state that while formulary apportionment has been suggested as an alternative, the OECD and its member countries continue to support the arm's length principle and reject formulary methods.

This position finds legal expression in Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which embodies the separate entity approach. Article 9 provides that when conditions are made or imposed between associated enterprises that differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises, profits that would otherwise have accrued to one enterprise but have not by reason of those conditions may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. This article presumes that enterprises within a multinational group are separate entities capable of earning distinct profits based on their individual contributions.

#### 2.2. Reasons for Rejecting Global Formulary Apportionment

The OECD articulates four principal reasons for rejecting GFA, each reflecting fundamental concerns about the approach's theoretical soundness and practical viability. First, formulary apportionment abandons the separate entity approach that has formed the basis of international taxation for nearly a century. By treating the multinational group as a single unit, GFA cannot adequately recognize the geographic and functional differences between various parts of the business. A research-intensive pharmaceutical subsidiary operates very differently from a routine distribution affiliate, yet a simple formula based on sales, assets, and payroll may not capture these distinctions in value creation.

Second, the OECD notes that formulary apportionment provides an incomplete solution to the problem of profit allocation. Even under GFA, the arm's length principle would still be required at the interface between the multinational group and external third parties. When a member of the group transacts with an unrelated joint venture partner or subcontracts work to an independent supplier, those transactions would still need to be evaluated under arm's length principles. This means that tax administrations and taxpayers would need to maintain transfer pricing capabilities and documentation systems even if GFA were adopted for intragroup transactions.

Third, implementing GFA would require fundamental changes to existing tax treaty networks. The current system of bilateral tax treaties is built on concepts enshrined in Articles 5, 7, and 9 of the OECD Model, which collectively establish that business profits are taxable in a jurisdiction only if there is a permanent establishment and that profits should be attributed to that establishment based on separate entity principles. Formulary apportionment would override these foundational treaty provisions, potentially requiring renegotiation of thousands of bilateral treaties worldwide (examined in June 2023).

Fourth, the OECD emphasizes the lack of international consensus on which factors should comprise the allocation formula and how they should be weighted. Countries with different economic profiles have divergent interests: capital-exporting countries with significant corporate headquarters might prefer formulas emphasizing assets and intellectual property, while market economies might favour sales-based factors. Manufacturing hubs might advocate for payroll weighting, while financial centers might resist formulas that disadvantage service industries. Without agreement on formula design, GFA could lead to more disputes than the current system.

#### 2.3. Practical and Political Obstacles

Beyond these conceptual objections, the OECD recognizes profound practical obstacles to implementing GFA. Reaching unanimous agreement on a single formula among countries with vastly different economic structures, development levels, and tax policy objectives would be extraordinarily difficult. Even within the European Union, where political integration is far more advanced than at the global level, efforts to adopt a common consolidated tax base with formulary apportionment have foundered on the requirement for unanimous approval among member states.

### 3. Arguments in Favour of Global Formulary Apportionment

#### 3.1. Administrative Simplicity

Proponents of global formulary apportionment advance several compelling arguments for reconsidering the current transfer pricing system. The primary advantage cited is administrative simplicity. Under the arm's length principle, taxpayers must prepare extensive transfer pricing documentation analyzing each material intercompany transaction, identifying comparable transactions between unrelated parties, and justifying why their pricing falls within an acceptable range. This process requires sophisticated economic analysis, access to commercial databases, and substantial professional fees for advisors.

In contrast, formulary apportionment would require only the calculation of consolidated group profits and the measurement of objective factors like sales, assets, and payroll in each jurisdiction. These figures are generally available from routine accounting records and financial statements. The elimination of comparability analyses, functional analyses, and the selection and application of transfer pricing methods could reduce compliance costs significantly, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises with limited resources for transfer pricing compliance.

#### 3.2. Addressing Profit Shifting

A second major argument for GFA concerns its anti-avoidance properties. The arm's length principle relies on pricing intercompany transactions as if they were between unrelated parties, but this assumes that comparable transactions can be identified and that pricing can be objectively verified. In practice, many intercompany transactions involve unique intangible assets, cost-sharing arrangements, or business restructurings for which truly comparable independent transactions do not exist. This subjectivity creates opportunities for aggressive tax planning and profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions.

Formulary factors such as sales, physical assets, and employee headcount are substantially harder to manipulate than intercompany transfer prices. While some degree of gaming is possible—companies might relocate employees or assets to jurisdictions where those factors are favourably weighted—such changes require actual economic substance and cannot be accomplished through mere contractual arrangements or paper transactions. GFA thus has the potential to align tax outcomes more closely with underlying economic activity.

#### 3.3. Alignment with Economic Substance

Advocates also argue that formulary apportionment better reflects economic reality. Modern multinational enterprises operate as integrated global businesses where value is created through the interaction of assets, personnel, and markets across multiple jurisdictions. Attempting to decompose this integrated value creation into separate entity results for each subsidiary can be artificial and arbitrary. The separate entity fiction assumes that a wholly-owned subsidiary would negotiate at arm's length with its parent company, when in reality corporate decisions are made centrally to optimize group outcomes.

Furthermore, GFA may particularly benefit developing countries that often lack the resources and expertise to challenge sophisticated transfer pricing arrangements employed by multinational enterprises. The information asymmetry between tax authorities and taxpayers is severe in transfer pricing disputes, as companies possess detailed knowledge of their operations and comparable transactions while tax administrations must rely on publicly available information. A formula-based system would level the playing field by reducing the scope for discretion and information advantage.

### 4. Arguments Against Global Formulary Apportionment

#### 4.1. Arbitrary Profit Allocation

Despite these advantages, global formulary apportionment faces substantial criticisms that explain the OECD's reluctance to endorse it. The most fundamental objection is that any formula will produce arbitrary results that do not correspond to actual value creation. Different industries create value in radically different ways: technology companies may generate enormous profits with minimal physical assets or employees, while retailers may have extensive sales and payroll but operate on thin margins. A single formula cannot accommodate this diversity.

Consider a pharmaceutical company that conducts all its research and development in one country, manufactures in another for cost efficiency, and sells globally. A sales-weighted formula would allocate most profits to market countries despite the fact that the critical value driver—drug discovery—occurred elsewhere. An asset-based formula might allocate profits to the manufacturing location even though that operation performs routine functions. No formula can capture the reality that a single blockbuster drug developed by a small research team creates more value than extensive manufacturing operations.

#### 4.2. Implementation Challenges

The practical challenges of implementing GFA internationally are formidable. Countries would need to agree not only on the principle of formulary apportionment but on the specific factors to include in the formula and their relative weights. Given that different formulas advantage different countries based on their economic profile, reaching consensus would require countries to subordinate their national interests to a global standard—a level of international cooperation that has proven elusive even in less contentious areas.

Even with agreement on a formula, standardization of accounting rules would be essential. If each country measures profits, sales, assets, and payroll according to different accounting standards, the formula would produce inconsistent results. The calculation of consolidated group profits would require agreement on which entities constitute part of the unitary business, what ownership threshold triggers inclusion, and how to handle partially-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. These technical details, while seemingly mundane, could significantly affect revenue allocation.

#### 4.3. Risk of Double Taxation

Another significant concern is the risk of double taxation during any transition period or if universal adoption cannot be achieved. If some countries apply formulary apportionment while others maintain the arm's length principle, multinational enterprises could find the same income taxed under both systems. Current tax treaties provide mechanisms for resolving double taxation arising under the separate entity approach, but these provisions may not function properly when one country applies a formulary method.

Moreover, formulary apportionment creates new opportunities for strategic behavior. While formula factors are less manipulable than transfer prices, they are not immune to gaming. If payroll is a formula factor, companies might use outsourcing and automation to minimize employees in high-tax jurisdictions. If assets are weighted heavily, companies might shift to asset-light business models or relocate valuable intangibles to favourable locations. The formula itself would distort business decisions and could reduce overall economic efficiency.

### 5. Practical Applications

#### 5.1. US State Taxation

The most extensive practical experience with formulary apportionment comes from the United States, where states have employed combined reporting and formulary methods for decades. Under the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA), many states require corporations engaged in a unitary business across multiple states to file combined reports and apportion their income using a formula. Initially, most states used the three-factor Massachusetts formula with equal weighting of sales, property, and payroll.

The US Supreme Court established the constitutional boundaries of state formulary apportionment in Container Corporation of America v. Franchise Tax Board (1983), holding that states may apply formulary apportionment to out-of-state income as long as the formula is rationally related to values connected with the taxing state and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. This decision validated the use of combined reporting even when it resulted in taxation of income not directly attributable to in-state activities under separate accounting principles.

#### 5.2. The Barclays Case

The international implications of US state formulary apportionment reached the Supreme Court in Barclays Bank plc v. Franchise Tax Board of California (1994). California applied worldwide combined reporting to Barclays, a UK banking group, requiring it to include the income of its global subsidiaries in the tax base and apportion that income to California using a three-factor formula. Barclays argued that this approach violated international tax norms embodied in the arm's length principle and conflicted with US tax treaties.

The Supreme Court rejected these challenges in a 7-2 decision, holding that the arm's length principle in US tax treaties did not constrain state taxation methods and that California's worldwide combined reporting did not create an impermissible burden on foreign commerce. While the decision was subsequently mooted by changes in California law and the resolution of disputes with the United Kingdom, it demonstrated that formulary apportionment could survive legal scrutiny even in the international context. The case also highlighted the tension formulary methods can create with treaty partners and the diplomatic complications that can arise.

#### 5.3. European Union Initiatives

The European Union has explored formulary apportionment as a potential solution to transfer pricing issues within the single market. In 2011, the European Commission proposed a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which would allow multinational groups operating in EU member states to calculate their profits on a consolidated basis and apportion them using a formula based on sales, labour, and assets. Each member state would then apply its own tax rate to its allocated share of the tax base.

The CCCTB proposal aimed to reduce compliance costs, eliminate transfer pricing disputes within the EU, and create a more level playing field for corporate taxation. However, because EU tax measures require unanimous approval by all member states, and because different states had divergent interests regarding the formula design and feared revenue losses, the proposal failed to gain adoption. A revised proposal in 2016 similarly stalled in negotiations.

In 2023, the European Commission introduced a new initiative, the Business in Europe Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT), which revisits the concept with a modified approach. Rather than immediately implementing formulary apportionment, BEFIT proposes a transitional allocation method for 2028-2035 where each group member is allocated a percentage of the aggregated tax base based on the average of its taxable results in the previous three fiscal years. After the transition period, a permanent allocation formula using substantive factors may be introduced, though the specific factors have not yet been determined. The proposal reflects lessons learned from the CCCTB experience but still faces the fundamental challenge of requiring unanimous member state approval for implementation.

### 6. Formulary Elements in Pillar One

#### 6.1. Amount A and Revenue-Based Allocation

The OECD's Pillar One initiative, agreed in principle by the Inclusive Framework in 2021, represents a significant departure from the organization's historical rejection of formulary apportionment. While the OECD maintains its opposition to comprehensive GFA, Pillar One incorporates formulary elements in its reallocation of taxing rights over a portion of the largest multinationals' profits.

Under the Amount A mechanism, multinational enterprises exceeding revenue and profitability thresholds will have a portion of their residual profits—specifically, 25% of profits exceeding a 10% profit margin—allocated to market jurisdictions based on sales revenue, regardless of physical presence. This allocation does not depend on transfer pricing analysis or the identification of functions performed in the market jurisdiction. Instead, it operates as a formulaic allocation based solely on revenue sourcing (discussed in June 2023).

The nexus rule for Amount A similarly adopts a formulary character by establishing that a jurisdiction qualifies for an allocation when a multinational derives at least a specified amount of revenue from that market, without requiring the permanent establishment that would be necessary under traditional treaty rules. This revenue-based nexus represents a fundamental shift toward recognizing market jurisdictions' claims to tax multinational profits based on sales alone.

#### 6.2. Hybrid Approaches in Contemporary Policy

Pillar One thus represents a hybrid approach that maintains the arm's length principle for the vast majority of profits while applying formulary allocation to a narrow slice of residual profits from the very largest businesses. This compromise attempts to address concerns about profit shifting and the inadequacy of physical presence tests in the digital economy while preserving the transfer pricing system that countries have invested decades in building.

The incorporation of formulary elements into Pillar One suggests that the binary choice between the arm's length principle and global formulary apportionment may be overly simplistic. Contemporary international tax policy may be moving toward blended approaches that use different methodologies for different types of income or taxpayers. Amount A applies formulary allocation only to residual profits above a threshold margin, implicitly recognizing that routine profits may be adequately addressed by traditional transfer pricing while excess returns present unique challenges.

Whether this hybrid model proves sustainable or represents a transitional step toward broader acceptance of formulary methods remains to be seen. The negotiations surrounding Pillar One have demonstrated both the appeal of formulary concepts for addressing perceived shortcomings in transfer pricing and the immense difficulty of achieving international consensus on formula design and implementation details.
