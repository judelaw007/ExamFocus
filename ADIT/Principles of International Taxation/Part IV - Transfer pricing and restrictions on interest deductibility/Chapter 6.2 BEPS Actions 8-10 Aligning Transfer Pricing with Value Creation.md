## Chapter 6.2: BEPS Actions 8-10 – Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation

BEPS Actions 8-10 represent the most comprehensive revision of transfer pricing rules since the original adoption of the arm's length principle. Published together in October 2015 as a consolidated report titled "Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation," these Actions introduced detailed guidance now incorporated throughout the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The central objective was ensuring that transfer pricing outcomes reflect where value is created within multinational enterprise groups, rather than where legal arrangements or capital happen to be located.

### 1. Structure and Objectives of Actions 8-10

#### 1.1. The Consolidated Report Framework

Though numbered separately, Actions 8, 9, and 10 were developed as an integrated package addressing interconnected concerns about profit allocation. Action 8 addresses transfer pricing aspects of intangibles, recognizing that misallocation of intangible-related profits represented a primary base erosion mechanism. Action 9 focuses on risks and capital, examining how contractual risk allocation and capital provision should affect profit entitlements. Action 10 targets other high-risk transactions, including the circumstances under which transactions may be disregarded and the application of profit-based methods.

The consolidated approach reflects the reality that aggressive tax planning structures often combined multiple elements—transferring intangibles to low-tax jurisdictions, contractually allocating risks to entities lacking substance, and funding arrangements through capital-rich entities performing few functions. Addressing these elements separately would have left gaps exploitable by sophisticated planners. The integrated framework ensures that the same principles—control, substance, and value creation—apply consistently across different transaction types.

The 2015 report resulted in revisions to Chapters I, II, VI, VII, and VIII of the Transfer Pricing Guidelines, with subsequent additions including Chapter X on financial transactions in 2020. As of 2025, over 100 jurisdictions representing more than 95 percent of global GDP have aligned their transfer pricing frameworks with these revised Guidelines.

#### 1.2. Central Principle: Substance Over Form

The unifying principle across Actions 8-10 is that transfer pricing outcomes must align with actual economic activity and value creation, not merely with legal arrangements or contractual allocations. This represents a decisive shift from pre-BEPS approaches where legal ownership of intangibles, contractual assumption of risks, and provision of capital could, standing alone, justify substantial profit allocations to entities with minimal functional substance.

Under the revised framework, entitlement to returns depends on performing functions, controlling risks, and using assets in connection with value-creating activities. Legal ownership and contractual arrangements establish starting points for analysis but do not determine outcomes. Where actual conduct differs from documented arrangements, conduct prevails. This substance-over-form orientation pervades every aspect of the revised guidance. *(covered in June 2023)*

### 2. Action 8: Intangibles

#### 2.1. Definition and Identification of Intangibles

Action 8 introduced a comprehensive definition of intangibles for transfer pricing purposes, broader than accounting or legal definitions. An intangible is something that is not a physical asset or a financial asset, which is capable of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities, and whose use or transfer would be compensated had it occurred in a transaction between independent parties in comparable circumstances.

This definition encompasses not only traditional intellectual property—patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets—but also know-how, customer relationships, customer lists, distribution rights, licenses, and similar items. Goodwill and going concern value are also recognized as intangibles, though their treatment may differ from separately identifiable intangibles. The breadth of the definition ensures that value-creating assets cannot escape transfer pricing scrutiny through narrow definitional limitations.

Identifying intangibles requires examining what assets contribute to value creation within the enterprise. Some intangibles are formally registered and legally protected; others exist only through ongoing business activities and competitive advantages. The transfer pricing analysis must identify all relevant intangibles, regardless of their formal legal status, to properly allocate returns to entities contributing to their development and exploitation.

#### 2.2. Ownership and Entitlement to Returns

The distinction between legal and economic ownership represents Action 8's most significant conceptual contribution. Legal ownership—formal title, registration, or contractual rights—establishes which entity may exploit an intangible and exclude others. However, legal ownership alone does not determine entitlement to intangible-related returns for transfer pricing purposes.

Returns from intangibles must be allocated based on contributions to the DEMPE functions: Development, Enhancement, Maintenance, Protection, and Exploitation. Development encompasses activities creating new intangibles through research, design, and innovation. Enhancement covers improvements increasing intangible value. Maintenance addresses activities preserving value, such as quality control. Protection includes legal activities safeguarding rights. Exploitation covers commercialization generating returns.

An entity performing no DEMPE functions—merely holding legal title while other entities perform all substantive activities—would receive only limited compensation for its nominal ownership role. The entity or entities performing DEMPE functions, controlling associated risks, and using assets in these activities would be entitled to returns reflecting their contributions. This framework directly targeted structures where intellectual property resided in low-substance entities while operating companies performed all value-creating work.

The analysis must examine actual conduct rather than merely contractual arrangements. Contracts may purport to allocate DEMPE functions, but if personnel of one entity actually perform functions nominally assigned to another, the actual performer's contributions determine profit allocation. Personnel capable of performing and actually performing these functions must be identified, along with their locations and the entities employing them.

#### 2.3. Hard-to-Value Intangibles Approach

Hard-to-value intangibles present particular challenges because reliable comparables often do not exist and valuations depend on projections with inherent uncertainty. Section D.4 of Chapter VI addresses these challenges through the HTVI approach, allowing tax administrations to use ex post outcomes as presumptive evidence of ex ante pricing appropriateness.

An intangible qualifies as hard-to-value when no reliable comparables exist at the time of transfer and projections of future cash flows or income are highly uncertain due to factors such as early-stage development, limited exploitation history, uncertain commercial success prospects, or projection periods extending many years. Under these circumstances, information asymmetry between taxpayers and tax administrations creates risks that pricing may not reflect arm's length conditions.

The HTVI approach permits adjustments where differences between actual outcomes and original projections were foreseeable or where developments increasing value were not adequately reflected in pricing. However, adjustments are inappropriate where outcomes differ due to genuinely unforeseeable developments occurring after the transaction, where the intangible is exploited under a genuine cost contribution arrangement meeting arm's length conditions, or where taxpayers provide reliable evidence that projections were reasonable when made.

Taxpayers can protect their positions through robust contemporaneous documentation demonstrating the reasonableness of assumptions underlying valuations, including sensitivity analyses, consideration of multiple scenarios, and evidence that projections reflected information reasonably available at transaction time. The guidance on HTVI application published in June 2018, now incorporated as Annex II to Chapter VI, provides additional implementation detail for both taxpayers and tax administrations.

### 3. Action 9: Risks and Capital

#### 3.1. The Six-Step Risk Analysis Framework

Action 9 introduced a structured framework for analyzing risk in controlled transactions, formalized as a six-step process in Chapter I. This framework addresses situations where contractual risk allocation does not correspond to actual risk management and control, and where capital-rich entities receive substantial returns without performing commensurate functions.

Step one requires identification of economically significant risks with specificity, examining strategic and marketplace risks, infrastructure and operational risks, financial risks, and transactional risks. Risks must be defined precisely rather than generically to enable meaningful analysis of who controls them.

Step two determines how risks are contractually allocated through written agreements. Contractual terms establish the starting point for analysis but do not conclude it. The analysis proceeds to examine whether contractual allocations are supported by actual conduct.

Step three analyzes actual conduct through functional analysis, examining which entities perform control functions, which are exposed to upside and downside consequences, and which have financial capacity to assume risks. This examination considers both formal decision-making structures and actual operational conduct.

Step four compares contractual allocation with actual conduct. Where conduct is consistent with contracts, the contractual allocation is respected. Where conduct diverges, conduct prevails in determining the accurately delineated transaction that will be priced.

Step five addresses situations where the contractual risk-bearer lacks control or financial capacity. Risks are reallocated to the entity exercising control and possessing financial capacity. If no single entity satisfies both requirements, the analysis must determine what arrangement independent parties would have reached.

Step six prices the transaction as accurately delineated, compensating risk management functions appropriately and allocating returns consistently with where control and capacity reside.

#### 3.2. Returns to Capital-Rich, Function-Poor Entities

Action 9 directly addressed cash box entities—capital-rich entities performing few functions beyond providing funding. Under pre-BEPS practice, such entities might receive substantial returns simply for providing capital and nominally assuming risks through contractual arrangements. The revised guidance limits returns for entities lacking substance.

Control over risk requires both capability to make decisions and actual performance of decision-making functions. An entity cannot control risks it lacks expertise to evaluate. Similarly, an entity whose risk-related decisions are actually made by personnel elsewhere does not control those risks regardless of formal designations.

Financial capacity means access to funding to assume risks, pay for risk mitigation, and bear consequences if risks materialize. An entity controlling risks it cannot financially bear presents an arrangement independent parties would not enter.

Where an entity provides funding without controlling associated financial risks, it is entitled to no more than a risk-free return. The entity controlling risks and having financial capacity receives returns reflecting that control. If the funding entity exercises some control over financial risks—such as performing credit analysis and monitoring—but does not control other economically significant risks, it may receive a risk-adjusted return reflecting its limited contributions but not full entrepreneurial returns.

This framework has significant implications for financing structures, intellectual property arrangements, and principal company models where central entities historically received residual profits while performing limited functions. *(covered in December 2024)*

### 4. Action 10: Other High-Risk Transactions

#### 4.1. Accurate Delineation of Actual Transactions

Action 10 reinforces the principle that transfer pricing analysis must begin with accurate delineation of the actual transaction between associated enterprises. This requirement addresses a fundamental tension in transfer pricing: associated enterprises can draft contracts allocating functions, assets, and risks in any manner they choose, unconstrained by the commercial pressures that would shape negotiations between independent parties. The accurate delineation requirement ensures that transfer pricing analysis examines economic reality rather than accepting carefully crafted legal arrangements at face value.

The written contracts between parties provide starting points, but the actual conduct of parties may reveal that the true transaction differs from documented arrangements.

Accurate delineation requires examining the economically relevant characteristics of the transaction: contractual terms, functions performed, assets used, risks assumed, economic circumstances, and business strategies. Where these factors suggest the actual transaction differs from the documented transaction, the accurately delineated transaction—not the documented one—forms the basis for pricing analysis.

This approach prevents associated enterprises from manufacturing arrangements through carefully drafted contracts that independent parties dealing at arm's length would not adopt. The analysis asks what transaction actually occurred based on all relevant evidence, then prices that transaction, rather than accepting documented terms at face value.

#### 4.2. Non-Recognition of Transactions

In exceptional circumstances, transactions may be disregarded entirely and replaced with alternative arrangements reflecting what independent parties would have done. This power of non-recognition is narrowly circumscribed and applies only where the arrangement, viewed in totality, differs from those which independent parties behaving in a commercially rational manner would have adopted in comparable circumstances.

Commercial rationality is assessed considering options realistically available to each party. A transaction may lack commercial rationality if it produces outcomes that would have been unacceptable to one party absent the relationship of association. The assessment considers whether the arrangement makes sense for each party individually, not merely for the group as a whole.

Non-recognition is a measure of last resort. Every effort should be made to determine the actual nature of the transaction and apply arm's length pricing to the accurately delineated transaction. Non-recognition applies only where the transaction as structured cannot be priced consistently with the arm's length principle because independent parties would not have entered such an arrangement on any terms.

Where non-recognition applies, the transaction is replaced with an alternative reflecting what independent parties would have done. This might involve recharacterizing a purported loan as an equity contribution, treating a nominal service arrangement as cost-sharing, or otherwise restructuring arrangements to reflect commercial reality. Tax administrations must identify the alternative arrangement rather than simply denying deductions or otherwise adjusting without specifying the arm's length alternative.

#### 4.3. Transactional Profit Split Method

Action 10 provided expanded guidance on the transactional profit split method, incorporated through revised Chapter II text in June 2018. The profit split method divides combined profits from controlled transactions based on relative contributions of each party, rather than testing one party's returns against external benchmarks.

The method is most appropriate where each party makes unique and valuable contributions—such as when both parties contribute valuable intangibles—and no reliable comparables exist for either party. It may also be appropriate for highly integrated operations where the parties' contributions cannot be evaluated separately in a meaningful way.

The profit split approach requires identifying relevant profits to be split, typically combined profits from the integrated transaction or business activity. Splitting factors must then be identified based on the relative value of each party's contributions, which may involve analysis of functions, assets, risks, or other economically relevant factors. The split must produce outcomes consistent with what independent parties would have agreed given their respective contributions.

The expanded guidance addresses both contribution analysis (allocating profits based on relative value of contributions) and residual analysis (first allocating routine returns to parties performing routine functions, then splitting residual profits based on unique contributions). Numerous examples illustrate application in various circumstances. *(covered in June 2024)*

### 5. Business Restructurings Under Actions 8-10

Chapter IX on business restructurings was revised to align with Actions 8-10 principles. Business restructurings—including conversions of full-fledged distributors or manufacturers to limited-risk entities, and transfers of intangibles to central locations—are common and legitimate business decisions. However, they may involve transfers of profit potential requiring arm's length compensation.

The revised guidance applies Actions 8-10 principles to restructuring analysis. Arm's length compensation for restructuring must consider the accurate delineation of what was actually transferred, which may include tangible assets, intangibles, risk-bearing capacity, customer relationships, going concern value, and profit potential. Where a restructuring transfers significant value, compensation reflecting that value must be paid. The analysis must identify all elements of value that would command compensation in dealings between independent parties, not merely those appearing on balance sheets or in formal asset registers.

Post-restructuring arrangements must also satisfy arm's length standards. If a restructured entity is left with minimal functions and risks, its returns should reflect that limited role. The entity receiving transferred functions, assets, and risks should be entitled to returns reflecting those enhanced contributions. The restructuring itself and the ongoing post-restructuring arrangements form integrated subjects of transfer pricing analysis.

Importantly, multinational enterprises remain free to organize their business operations as they consider appropriate. Tax administrations cannot dictate business structures or require enterprises to maintain particular arrangements simply to preserve domestic tax bases. However, where restructurings occur, the transfer pricing consequences must be determined according to the arm's length principle, and any transfers of value must be appropriately compensated. The commercial rationale for restructuring should be documented contemporaneously, including the expected benefits and how risks will be managed post-restructuring.

### 6. Implementation and Documentation Requirements

Actions 8-10 have been implemented through domestic legislation and administrative practice across more than 100 Inclusive Framework jurisdictions. Implementation approaches vary, with some jurisdictions incorporating OECD Guidelines by reference and others enacting specific statutory provisions. The three-tiered documentation structure—master file, local file, and country-by-country report—provides the information infrastructure supporting Actions 8-10 application.

Documentation for intangibles must address identification of all relevant intangibles, analysis of legal and economic ownership, detailed DEMPE functional analysis, and valuation methodology with supporting assumptions. For HTVI transactions, contemporaneous documentation of projections and their underlying assumptions provides critical protection against ex post adjustment.

Documentation for risk allocation must address contractual terms, evidence of control (including decision-making processes, organizational structures, and personnel capabilities), evidence of financial capacity, and analysis of whether conduct matches contracts. Documentation for business restructurings should address the decision-making process, commercial rationale, identification of transferred value, and basis for compensation determination.

The practical effect of Actions 8-10 is that transfer pricing analysis requires more comprehensive substance analysis than previously. Entities seeking returns must demonstrate their contributions to value creation through functions, risk control, and asset utilization. Documentation must support not merely pricing outcomes but the entire analysis of how transactions were structured and why the associated enterprises' arrangements reflect arm's length dealing.
