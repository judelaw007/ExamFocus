## Chapter 6.1: Impact of BEPS on Transfer Pricing

The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project fundamentally reshaped transfer pricing principles, moving the framework from a primary focus on legal arrangements toward an emphasis on economic substance and value creation. Prior to BEPS, sophisticated tax planning exploited gaps between transfer pricing rules and actual value-generating activities, enabling multinational enterprises to allocate profits to entities with minimal functional presence. The BEPS project, through Actions 8-10, introduced conceptual shifts that now permeate every aspect of transfer pricing analysis under the 2022 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

### 1. The BEPS Project and Transfer Pricing Context

#### 1.1. Origins and Policy Objectives

The BEPS project emerged from G20 concern that international tax rules had failed to keep pace with evolving business models. Highly digitalized enterprises and integrated supply chains enabled profit allocation arrangements that, while technically compliant with existing rules, produced outcomes divorced from the locations where economic activities occurred and value was created. The 2013 BEPS Action Plan identified transfer pricing as central to addressing these concerns, with Actions 8-10 specifically targeting the alignment of transfer pricing outcomes with value creation.

The fundamental policy objective was ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activities generating those profits occur and where value is created. This principle—aligning taxation with value creation—became the conceptual anchor for all subsequent transfer pricing reforms. The phrase appears throughout the BEPS reports and the revised Guidelines, signalling a decisive shift from formalistic approaches emphasizing legal arrangements toward substantive analysis of actual functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed.

The political context shaped the reforms significantly. Public attention to tax arrangements of high-profile multinationals created pressure for visible change, while the Inclusive Framework structure ensured broad international participation in developing new standards. The reforms represented consensus among over 140 jurisdictions, lending them authority that purely OECD-driven initiatives might have lacked.

#### 1.2. Actions 8-10 Overview

BEPS Actions 8-10 addressed transfer pricing aspects of intangibles (Action 8), risks and capital (Action 9), and high-risk transactions including business restructurings (Action 10). Though numbered separately, these Actions were developed and reported together, reflecting their interconnected nature. The consolidated 2015 report introduced revisions subsequently incorporated into Chapters I, II, VI, VII, and VIII of the Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

Action 8 focused on intangibles, recognizing that traditional transfer pricing analysis had struggled with these assets. Legal ownership of intangibles, standing alone, was declared insufficient to entitle an entity to intangible-related returns. Instead, returns must flow to entities performing functions, using assets, and controlling risks in relation to development, enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation of intangibles.

Action 9 addressed contractual allocation of risks and the role of capital in transfer pricing. The reforms established that entities must have both control over risks and financial capacity to assume risks before being entitled to risk-related returns. Entities providing capital without controlling the associated risks are entitled only to risk-free returns.

Action 10 examined other high-risk areas, including management fees, head office expenses, and business restructurings. The guidance reinforced that transfer pricing analysis must examine actual conduct of parties rather than merely contractual arrangements, introducing the concept of accurately delineating the actual transaction. *(covered in June 2023)*

### 2. The DEMPE Framework

#### 2.1. Conceptual Foundation

The DEMPE framework—encompassing Development, Enhancement, Maintenance, Protection, and Exploitation functions—represents the most significant conceptual innovation arising from BEPS. The framework provides structured analysis for determining which entities within a multinational group are entitled to returns from intangible assets. Its importance extends beyond intangibles analysis, establishing the broader principle that functional contributions, not legal ownership, determine profit allocation.

Development encompasses activities creating intangibles, including research and development, design, and innovation. Enhancement covers subsequent improvements increasing intangible value. Maintenance addresses activities preserving intangible value, such as quality control and updating. Protection encompasses legal activities safeguarding intangibles, including patent prosecution, trademark registration, and litigation. Exploitation covers commercialization activities generating returns from intangibles.

The framework rejects the notion that funding intangible development, without more, entitles an entity to intangible returns. An entity merely providing capital while another entity performs all DEMPE functions would receive only a capital return, with residual profits flowing to the entity performing functions. This principle directly targeted structures where intellectual property was held by shell entities lacking substance while operating entities performed all value-creating activities.

#### 2.2. Application in Practice

Applying the DEMPE framework requires detailed functional analysis identifying which entities perform each category of function. Multiple entities may contribute to intangible value creation, requiring allocation of returns reflecting respective contributions. The analysis must examine actual conduct rather than merely contractual arrangements, as contracts purporting to allocate functions may not reflect operational reality.

Consider a pharmaceutical group where the parent company's employees conduct all research activities, make development decisions, and oversee clinical trials, while a subsidiary in another jurisdiction legally owns resulting patents through a cost-sharing arrangement. Under pre-BEPS analysis, the subsidiary's legal ownership might have supported its entitlement to exploitation returns. Under the DEMPE framework, the subsidiary performs no development functions, makes no enhancement decisions, and contributes only funding. The parent company performing all substantive functions would be entitled to returns commensurate with those contributions, with the subsidiary receiving only a funding return. *(covered in June 2025)*

### 3. Risk and Capital in Transfer Pricing

#### 3.1. Control Over Risk

BEPS Action 9 fundamentally changed how risks factor into transfer pricing analysis. The revised guidance establishes a six-step framework for analyzing risk in controlled transactions. The first step requires identification of economically significant risks with specificity, examining strategic and marketplace risks, infrastructure and operational risks, financial risks, and transactional risks. The second step determines how risks are contractually assumed through written agreements. The third step analyzes how parties actually function regarding risk management through examination of conduct.

The fourth step establishes whether contractual risk allocation is consistent with actual conduct. Where contracts and conduct diverge, conduct prevails. The fifth step determines which party exercises control over risk and has financial capacity to assume it. The sixth step applies the arm's length principle to the transaction as accurately delineated through the preceding analysis, which may differ from the transaction as contractually documented.

Control over risk requires both capability to make decisions regarding risk-taking and actual performance of decision-making functions. An entity lacking personnel with relevant expertise cannot meaningfully control risks in areas requiring specialized knowledge. Similarly, an entity whose risk-related decisions are actually made by personnel in another jurisdiction does not control those risks regardless of contractual designations.

The control requirement addresses structures where risks were contractually assigned to low-function entities through carefully drafted agreements while actual risk management occurred elsewhere. Such arrangements could no longer support attribution of risk-related returns to the contractual risk-bearer absent genuine control.

#### 3.2. Financial Capacity to Bear Risk

Even entities controlling risks must demonstrate financial capacity to assume them. Financial capacity means the entity can absorb consequences if risks materialize—including access to funding to cover potential losses without imperiling continued operations. An entity controlling risks it cannot financially bear presents an arrangement unlikely to occur between independent parties.

The financial capacity requirement operates alongside, not instead of, the control requirement. An entity may have substantial capital but lack control over risks, in which case it is entitled only to a risk-free return on capital provided. Conversely, an entity may control risks but lack capacity to bear them, suggesting the arrangement requires re-characterization.

#### 3.3. Cash Box Arrangements

Perhaps the most direct target of Action 9 was the "cash box" entity—an entity possessing capital but performing no significant functions. Under pre-BEPS analysis, such entities might receive substantial returns simply for providing funding and nominally bearing risks. The revised guidance explicitly addresses this scenario: where an associated enterprise providing funding exercises no control over financial risk associated with funding, it will not be entitled to more than a risk-free return.

The cash box concept extends beyond funding arrangements to any situation where capital is divorced from control. An entity providing capital for intangible development while another entity controls development decisions would receive only a financing return. The same principle applies to entities funding inventory, receivables, or other assets while lacking control over related risks.

This guidance represented a significant departure from prior practice, where entities could structure arrangements securing substantial returns through capital provision alone. Tax administrations gained explicit authority to reallocate returns based on functional analysis, with capital providers limited to returns appropriate for their actual contributions.

### 4. Intangibles and Value Creation

#### 4.1. Legal Versus Economic Ownership

The distinction between legal and economic ownership of intangibles represents a foundational conceptual shift. Legal ownership—registered title, contractual rights, or other formal indicia of ownership—establishes which entity may exploit an intangible and exclude others. However, legal ownership alone does not determine entitlement to intangible-related returns for transfer pricing purposes.

Economic ownership derives from performing DEMPE functions, controlling related risks, and using assets in connection with intangible development and exploitation. An entity performing substantial DEMPE functions acquires economic ownership entitling it to returns regardless of legal arrangements. Conversely, an entity with legal title but no functional involvement—merely funding development performed by others—lacks economic ownership supporting intangible returns.

The distinction addresses arrangements where intellectual property was transferred to or developed in low-tax jurisdictions through structures ensuring legal ownership resided there while functional activities occurred elsewhere. Such arrangements can no longer support concentration of intangible returns in the legal owner; returns must be allocated consistent with DEMPE contributions.

#### 4.2. Hard-to-Value Intangibles

Hard-to-value intangibles present specific challenges addressed in Section D.4 of Chapter VI. These are intangibles for which, at the time of transfer, no reliable comparables exist and projections of future cash flows or income expected from the intangible are highly uncertain. Given information asymmetry between taxpayers and tax administrations, HTVI guidance permits administrations to use ex post outcomes as presumptive evidence of ex ante pricing appropriateness.

The HTVI guidance allows adjustment where differences between ex post outcomes and ex ante projections were unforeseeable or foreseeable but not adequately considered. However, adjustment is inappropriate where outcomes differ due to unforeseeable developments, where the intangible was exploited under a genuine cost-sharing arrangement, or where the taxpayer provides reliable evidence that projections were reasonable when made.

This approach balances taxpayer certainty against administrative capacity to verify intangible valuations. Taxpayers can protect positions through robust documentation demonstrating reasonableness of projections at transaction time, including sensitivity analyses and consideration of multiple scenarios.

### 5. Specific Guidance Revisions

#### 5.1. Commodity Transactions

Commodity trading structures historically presented significant BEPS risks because the fungible nature of commodities and the presence of quoted market prices should, in principle, make arm's length pricing straightforward—yet sophisticated structures exploited flexibility in pricing dates and transaction characterization to achieve desired profit allocations. The reforms addressed this disconnect between apparent simplicity and practical manipulation.

BEPS revisions addressed commodity transactions through Section D.2 of Chapter II, recognizing that commodities present particular comparability opportunities and challenges. The revised guidance establishes that comparable uncontrolled price methods are generally most appropriate for commodity transactions, with quoted prices providing reference points even where adjustments are necessary.

The guidance addresses pricing date issues particularly relevant to commodities. Where no pricing date is specified, or where specified dates are inconsistent with actual conduct, tax administrations may impute a pricing date based on evidence of when the taxpayer would have agreed prices if independent. This addresses arrangements where pricing dates were manipulated to achieve desired transfer prices after commodity price movements became known.

For commodities traded on exchanges with reliable quoted prices, the guidance strengthens comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method application while acknowledging that adjustments may be necessary for quality differentials, transportation costs, and market tier differences. The emphasis on quoted prices constrains transfer pricing flexibility previously available in commodity trading structures.

#### 5.2. Low Value-Adding Intra-Group Services

Chapter VII addresses low value-adding intra-group services through a simplified approach providing administrative convenience for routine services. Services qualifying for the simplified approach may be charged at cost plus a markup of five percent, with limited documentation requirements. This represents a safe harbour protecting qualifying arrangements from challenge.

Services eligible for the simplified approach must be supportive in nature, not part of core business activities, not creating or using unique intangibles, and not involving assumption of significant risks. Examples include accounting, audit, human resources, and information technology services of a routine nature. Excluded are services constituting core business, those provided by associated enterprises with management or control functions, and financial services.

The simplified approach addresses administrative burden of documenting arm's length pricing for high-volume, low-value routine services. By establishing a fixed markup applicable across services meeting qualifying criteria, the guidance reduces compliance costs while providing certainty against adjustment for compliant arrangements. *(covered in December 2024)*

#### 5.3. Cost Contribution Arrangements

BEPS reforms substantially revised Chapter VIII on cost contribution arrangements, bringing CCA guidance into alignment with the broader value creation principle. The revised guidance emphasizes that participants must expect benefits from CCA activities proportionate to their contributions, with contributions measured by value rather than merely cost. This distinction matters because pre-BEPS arrangements sometimes allowed participants contributing only cash to share equally with participants contributing valuable functions and existing intangibles.

A participant lacking capacity to exploit expected benefits cannot be a genuine CCA participant. An entity with no operations in relevant markets, no sales force, and no distribution capabilities cannot meaningfully exploit jointly developed intangibles and should therefore not be treated as a CCA participant entitled to proportionate benefit interests. Similarly, a participant making contributions lacking arm's length value to the arrangement—such as providing only funding while others contribute functions—would not be entitled to participant status with proportionate benefit entitlements.

The guidance permits buy-in and buy-out payments when participants join or leave, reflecting the principle that ongoing arrangements should not permit participants to access benefits without appropriate compensation. A new participant joining a CCA where existing participants have already contributed substantial value must make compensating payments for access to pre-existing developments. Departing participants must receive compensation for contributions already made to developments from which they will no longer benefit.

#### 5.4. Business Restructurings

Chapter IX on business restructurings received significant attention under BEPS, though much of the pre-existing guidance remained intact. The key enhancement was strengthening the requirement to accurately delineate restructuring transactions before determining arm's length compensation. Restructurings involve transfers of functions, assets, or risks between associated enterprises, often justified by commercial rationales such as operational efficiency or market responsiveness.

The revised guidance requires examination of whether the restructuring as structured would occur between independent parties. Where restructuring terms depart significantly from what independent parties would agree, adjustments may be warranted. Compensation for restructured arrangements must reflect the value of whatever is transferred, including going concern value, customer relationships, and other intangibles that may not appear on balance sheets but possess genuine commercial value.

Importantly, the guidance confirms that tax administrations cannot disregard commercial restructurings simply because alternative structures might generate greater domestic tax revenue. However, they can challenge the transfer pricing aspects of restructurings, including inadequate compensation for transferred value, unrealistic risk allocations post-restructuring, or terms reflecting the influence of association rather than arm's length dealing.

### 6. Integration Into the 2022 Guidelines

The 2022 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines represent the complete integration of BEPS reforms into the foundational transfer pricing framework. The Guidelines incorporate all revisions from Actions 8-10, additional guidance on financial transactions added in 2020, and subsequent clarifications. The 2022 consolidation ensures that practitioners working with current guidance access the complete post-BEPS framework rather than navigating between original Guidelines and subsequent reports.

The addition of Chapter X on financial transactions in 2020 extended BEPS principles to intra-group financing arrangements. This guidance addresses loans, guarantees, captive insurance, and cash pooling, establishing that the same functional analysis determining profit allocation for operational transactions applies equally to financial arrangements. Treasury functions generating returns from financial transactions must be analyzed using the same DEMPE and risk control frameworks applicable to other value-creating activities.

The integration transformed transfer pricing from an exercise primarily concerned with pricing controlled transactions to a comprehensive framework examining the overall allocation of functions, assets, and risks within multinational groups. The accurate delineation of actual transactions—examining what parties actually do rather than merely what contracts state—now precedes any pricing analysis. This sequencing ensures that pricing methodologies apply to arrangements reflecting economic reality rather than artificial structures.

The practical implications for multinational enterprises are substantial. Transfer pricing policies developed before BEPS require review against current standards, particularly regarding intangible ownership structures, risk allocation arrangements, and financing transactions. Documentation must address DEMPE analysis, risk control, and financial capacity in addition to traditional benchmarking. Failure to align structures with post-BEPS requirements exposes enterprises to adjustment risk as tax administrations apply the revised guidance.

The BEPS transfer pricing reforms reflect a broader shift in international taxation toward substance requirements. Whether through permanent establishment rules, treaty anti-abuse provisions, or transfer pricing guidance, the consistent theme is that tax outcomes should align with economic activities and value creation. Transfer pricing, as the mechanism determining profit allocation among related entities, necessarily occupies a central position in this framework, explaining why Actions 8-10 represented core elements of the BEPS project rather than peripheral concerns.
