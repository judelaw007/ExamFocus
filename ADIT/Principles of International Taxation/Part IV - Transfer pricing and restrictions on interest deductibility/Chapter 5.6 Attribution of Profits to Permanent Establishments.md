## Chapter 5.6: Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments

When an enterprise of one contracting state carries on business through a permanent establishment in another state, determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment presents distinctive analytical challenges. Unlike transactions between legally separate associated enterprises, the permanent establishment and its head office constitute parts of a single legal entity, requiring construction of hypothetical arrangements to determine appropriate profit allocation. The OECD has developed comprehensive guidance addressing this challenge, culminating in the Authorized OECD Approach established through the 2010 Report on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments.

The development of unified profit attribution guidance reflected recognition that divergent national approaches created both administrative complexity and opportunities for double taxation or double non-taxation. The 2010 Report represented the culmination of a thirteen-year project, replacing earlier guidance that left substantial room for interpretive variation. By establishing the Authorized OECD Approach as the definitive methodology, the Report sought to achieve consistent treatment of permanent establishment profits across jurisdictions adhering to OECD standards.

### 1. The Separate Entity Principle

Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention establishes that the profits attributable to a permanent establishment are those the establishment might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a part. This separate entity principle provides the conceptual foundation for all profit attribution analysis.

#### 1.1. Conceptual Foundation

The separate entity principle requires treating the permanent establishment as though it were an independent enterprise, notwithstanding that it legally remains part of the same entity as its head office. This fiction enables application of arm's length pricing principles to internal arrangements that lack the legal substance of transactions between separate parties. Without this conceptual framework, determining appropriate profit allocation between different parts of a single enterprise would lack principled foundation.

The approach parallels the treatment of associated enterprises under Article 9, which permits adjustment of profits where conditions between related parties differ from those that would apply between independent enterprises. By extending this arm's length logic to permanent establishments, Article 7 ensures consistent treatment regardless of whether foreign operations are conducted through subsidiaries or branches. This consistency prevents structural form from determining tax outcomes where economic substance is equivalent.

Historical approaches to permanent establishment profit attribution varied significantly across jurisdictions. Some applied formulary apportionment based on factors such as revenue, assets, or employees, while others permitted only direct attribution of specifically identifiable income and expenses. The OECD's development of unified guidance sought to reduce these inconsistencies and the double taxation or non-taxation they could produce.

#### 1.2. The Functionally Separate Entity

The 2010 Report on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments refined the separate entity principle through the concept of the functionally separate entity. Under this approach, the permanent establishment is hypothesized as a separate enterprise performing functions, using assets, and assuming risks attributed to it through detailed functional analysis. This hypothetical enterprise is then treated as dealing at arm's length with all other parts of the enterprise.

The functionally separate entity concept recognizes that permanent establishments typically perform only some functions of the overall enterprise, use only some assets, and bear only some risks. Accurate profit attribution requires identifying precisely which functions, assets, and risks belong to the permanent establishment rather than to other parts of the enterprise. This granular analysis prevents both over-attribution and under-attribution of profits.

Constructing the functionally separate entity requires examining actual arrangements between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise, even though these arrangements lack legal enforceability. The analysis considers management decisions, personnel activities, physical asset locations, and risk exposures to determine what the permanent establishment would hypothetically own and control if it were genuinely separate.

### 2. The Authorized OECD Approach

The Authorized OECD Approach, established through the 2010 Report, provides the definitive methodology for attributing profits to permanent establishments. The approach applies a two-step analysis: first determining the activities and responsibilities of the permanent establishment through functional analysis, then applying transfer pricing principles to determine arm's length remuneration for dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise.

#### 2.1. Step One: Functional Analysis

The first step requires comprehensive analysis of the functions performed by personnel operating through the permanent establishment, the assets used in performing those functions, and the risks assumed in connection with permanent establishment activities. This functional analysis mirrors the approach applied to associated enterprise transactions under the Transfer Pricing Guidelines, adapted for the permanent establishment context.

Functions performed by permanent establishment personnel determine the activities for which the establishment should receive profit attribution. Personnel physically present in the permanent establishment jurisdiction who make decisions, provide services, or otherwise contribute to enterprise value creation establish the functional basis for profit attribution. The significance of functions performed, rather than merely their existence, influences the quantum of profits attributable.

Asset attribution follows from functional analysis. Assets used by permanent establishment personnel in performing attributed functions are treated as economically owned by the permanent establishment for profit attribution purposes. This includes tangible assets physically located in the permanent establishment jurisdiction and intangible assets developed or used by permanent establishment personnel. The permanent establishment must be attributed sufficient capital to support these asset holdings.

Risk attribution similarly derives from functional analysis. Risks associated with functions performed by permanent establishment personnel, including operational risks, market risks, and credit risks, are attributed to the permanent establishment. The location where risk management decisions are made and where personnel exercise control over risk exposures determines risk attribution. Risks cannot be attributed to a permanent establishment lacking personnel with authority to manage those risks.

#### 2.2. Step Two: Transfer Pricing Analogy

The second step applies transfer pricing principles, by analogy, to determine arm's length compensation for dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise. Having identified the functions, assets, and risks of the permanent establishment through step one analysis, step two prices the internal dealings as though they occurred between independent parties.

The Transfer Pricing Guidelines methodologies apply to permanent establishment dealings in the same manner as to associated enterprise transactions. The comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus method, transactional net margin method, and profit split method may all be appropriate depending on the nature of the dealing and available comparables. Selection follows the same most appropriate method principles applicable to associated enterprise analysis.

This application by analogy reflects the economic equivalence between permanent establishment structures and subsidiary structures. An enterprise conducting foreign operations through a subsidiary would engage in priced transactions with that subsidiary; the permanent establishment analysis constructs equivalent pricing for the internal dealings that substitute for such transactions. The goal is ensuring equivalent tax treatment regardless of structural choice.

The alignment between permanent establishment and associated enterprise methodologies serves important policy objectives. Prior to the Authorized OECD Approach, enterprises could achieve different tax outcomes by choosing branch structures over subsidiary structures, even where the underlying economic activities were identical. By ensuring both structures produce equivalent profit attribution, the Approach removes tax considerations from structural decisions, allowing commercial factors to determine organizational form.

### 3. Internal Dealings

The concept of dealings represents a central innovation of the Authorized OECD Approach. Since permanent establishments and their head offices constitute single legal entities, no legally binding transactions occur between them. The dealing concept constructs hypothetical transactions representing the transfer of functions, assets, or risks between different parts of the enterprise.

#### 3.1. The Dealing Concept

Dealings are identified through functional analysis revealing transfers of value between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise. Where permanent establishment personnel use assets owned by the head office, a dealing exists representing provision of those assets. Where head office personnel provide services supporting permanent establishment operations, a dealing exists representing those services. Where risks initially assumed by one part of the enterprise are subsequently managed by another, a dealing may exist representing risk transfer.

Recognition of dealings requires sufficient evidence that economically significant activities occurred between different parts of the enterprise. Internal documentation, management decisions, personnel activities, and actual conduct all contribute to identifying dealings. The absence of legally binding agreements does not preclude dealing recognition where economic substance supports the hypothetical transaction.

Dealings may involve provision of goods, services, intangible property, or financing between parts of the enterprise. A permanent establishment manufacturing products subsequently sold by the head office would have a dealing representing goods transfer. A head office providing management oversight to a permanent establishment would have a dealing representing service provision. These dealings must be identified comprehensively to ensure complete profit attribution analysis.

#### 3.2. Arm's Length Remuneration

Each identified dealing requires pricing at arm's length. The permanent establishment should receive or pay amounts equivalent to what independent parties would agree for comparable arrangements. This ensures that profits attributed to the permanent establishment reflect fair remuneration for functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed, while profits retained by other parts of the enterprise similarly reflect their contributions.

Arm's length pricing of dealings applies the same economic principles as pricing of associated enterprise transactions, though practical challenges may differ. Comparable transactions between independent parties may be scarcer for some dealing types, requiring greater reliance on internal benchmarking or economic analysis. The permanent establishment context may also involve unique assets or arrangements lacking external comparables.

The requirement for arm's length dealing prices prevents artificial profit shifting between jurisdictions through internal arrangements. Without such pricing, enterprises could concentrate profits in low-tax jurisdictions by understating remuneration for permanent establishment contributions or overstating charges from head offices. The dealing framework ensures permanent establishments receive appropriate profit attribution regardless of internal pricing practices.

### 4. Capital and Funding Attribution

Permanent establishments require capital to support their operations, fund their assets, and absorb their risks. Determining appropriate capital attribution presents particular challenges given the absence of legal capital structures for permanent establishments and the fungibility of enterprise-wide funding.

#### 4.1. Capital Allocation Principles

The Authorized OECD Approach requires attribution of sufficient capital to support the assets and risks attributed to the permanent establishment through functional analysis. The permanent establishment should hold capital equivalent to what an independent enterprise would require to conduct the same activities, hold the same assets, and bear the same risks. This free capital generates no interest expense, ensuring permanent establishment profits are not artificially reduced through excessive interest allocations.

Capital allocation reflects the principle that capital follows risk. Where risks are attributed to the permanent establishment through functional analysis, sufficient capital to absorb potential losses from those risks must also be attributed. An independent enterprise assuming equivalent risks would maintain capital reserves; the permanent establishment must be hypothesized as doing likewise.

The 2010 Report acknowledges that capital allocation involves judgment and that multiple reasonable approaches may produce different outcomes within acceptable ranges. Tax administrations should not expect precision beyond what the underlying methodology can support. Ranges of acceptable results recognize the inherent uncertainty in constructing hypothetical capital structures for entities lacking legal capital requirements.

#### 4.2. Key Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking Functions

For financial institutions, the Key Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking function concept provides specific guidance on capital and asset attribution. Financial assets generating returns commensurate with assumed risks are attributed to locations where personnel perform key entrepreneurial risk-taking functions, meaning functions involving assumption, management, and disposition of risk exposures.

The key entrepreneurial risk-taking function analysis recognizes that financial institutions generate profits primarily through risk-taking rather than through manufacturing or service provision. Attributing profits requires identifying where risk decisions are made and where personnel exercise control over risk exposures. Personnel performing routine functions without decision-making authority do not generate key entrepreneurial risk-taking function attribution.

This concept applies particularly to banking operations, where loan origination, trading decisions, and risk management activities determine profit attribution. A permanent establishment with personnel making lending decisions and managing credit risk would receive attribution of loans and associated interest income. A permanent establishment performing only administrative functions without credit decision authority would receive lesser attribution.

### 5. Sector-Specific Considerations

The 2010 Report includes specific guidance for banking and insurance operations, recognizing the distinctive characteristics of financial sector permanent establishments. These sector-specific provisions address challenges arising from the nature of financial assets, the role of regulatory capital, and the particular functions performed by financial institutions.

#### 5.1. Banking Operations

Banks generate profits through accepting deposits, making loans, trading financial instruments, and providing financial services. Attributing these profits to permanent establishments requires analysis of where personnel perform the functions generating each profit stream. Deposit-taking, loan origination, trading, and service provision may occur in different locations, necessitating granular functional analysis.

Regulatory capital requirements influence but do not determine profit attribution. Permanent establishments of banks may face local regulatory capital requirements reflecting the risks of their activities. These requirements provide relevant benchmarks for capital attribution but do not override functional analysis. The Authorized OECD Approach attributes capital based on economic risks rather than regulatory compliance.

Internal funding arrangements between bank permanent establishments and their head offices constitute dealings requiring arm's length pricing. The permanent establishment should be credited or charged interest on internal funds at rates reflecting its creditworthiness and the nature of the funding. These internal interest flows significantly affect permanent establishment profit attribution.

#### 5.2. Insurance Operations

Insurance operations generate profits through underwriting risk and investing premium reserves. Attribution of insurance permanent establishment profits requires determining where underwriting decisions are made, where claims are managed, and where investment activities occur. Each function may be performed in different locations, requiring separate attribution analysis.

Premium income attribution follows underwriting function location. Where permanent establishment personnel evaluate risks, price policies, and accept coverage, the permanent establishment receives premium attribution. Where underwriting occurs elsewhere with permanent establishments performing only administrative functions, premium attribution flows to the underwriting location.

Investment income attribution follows the location of investment decision-making. Reserves held to meet future claims may be invested through personnel in various locations. Profit attribution follows the location where investment strategies are determined and portfolio management decisions are made, not merely where administrative processing occurs. *(covered in June 2024)*

### 6. BEPS Action 7 Implications

BEPS Action 7 addressed artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status through commissionaire arrangements, specific activity exemptions, and contract splitting. The expanded permanent establishment definitions resulting from Action 7 create additional profit attribution challenges, as newly recognized permanent establishments may involve limited physical presence and functions.

The OECD published additional guidance in 2018 addressing profit attribution to permanent establishments arising under the modified Article 5 provisions. This guidance applies the Authorized OECD Approach principles to dependent agent permanent establishments and other arrangements newly captured by expanded permanent establishment definitions.

Dependent agent permanent establishments present particular attribution challenges. Where an enterprise has a permanent establishment solely through a dependent agent concluding contracts, the permanent establishment may lack physical assets, employees, or premises. Profit attribution must nonetheless proceed through functional analysis, focusing on the activities performed by the dependent agent and any personnel supporting those activities.

The additional guidance confirms that permanent establishment profit attribution remains anchored in functional analysis. Even where expanded permanent establishment definitions capture arrangements with minimal physical presence, profits are attributed only to the extent functions, assets, and risks are attributable to the permanent establishment. The mere existence of a permanent establishment does not guarantee substantial profit attribution absent substantial functions.

Anti-fragmentation rules preventing artificial separation of activities to claim preparatory or auxiliary exemptions similarly affect profit attribution. Where previously separate activities are aggregated to find a permanent establishment, profit attribution must address the aggregated activities. The permanent establishment receives attribution for all functions performed across the aggregated activities, not merely for any single activity that might individually exceed preparatory or auxiliary thresholds.

The interaction between expanded permanent establishment definitions and profit attribution principles ensures that BEPS Action 7 modifications produce appropriate tax outcomes. Expanded definitions ensure jurisdictions can tax genuine economic activities within their territories; profit attribution principles ensure the quantum of taxable profits reflects actual value creation occurring through permanent establishment activities.

The relationship between permanent establishment existence and profit attribution magnitude reflects a deliberate policy design. Expansion of permanent establishment definitions under BEPS Action 7 increases the situations where source jurisdictions may tax foreign enterprises, but the Authorized OECD Approach ensures taxation remains proportionate to actual activities. A dependent agent permanent establishment performing limited functions receives correspondingly limited profit attribution, preventing the expanded definitions from generating disproportionate source country taxation. This calibration maintains balance between source and residence taxation rights while addressing the artificial avoidance arrangements that motivated Action 7 reforms.
