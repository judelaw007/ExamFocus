## Chapter 9: BEPS Action 4 – Interest Deductions

BEPS Action 4 represents the OECD's coordinated response to base erosion through excessive interest deductions. Published in October 2015 with technical updates in December 2016, this action establishes best practice recommendations for limiting the deductibility of interest payments that enable multinational enterprises to shift profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions. Unlike the BEPS minimum standards, Action 4 operates as a best practice recommendation, giving countries discretion in adoption while promoting convergence toward a common approach.

### 1. The BEPS Concern with Interest Deductions

#### 1.1. Interest as a BEPS Instrument

Interest deductions represent one of the most significant and accessible mechanisms for base erosion and profit shifting. The structural preference in corporate taxation for debt over equity creates opportunities for multinational groups to reduce taxable income in high-tax jurisdictions by substituting deductible interest payments for non-deductible equity returns.

Three principal concerns drove the development of Action 4. First, international groups may allocate disproportionate levels of third-party debt to operations in high-tax countries, concentrating interest deductions where they provide greatest tax benefit. Second, intragroup loans enable entities to claim interest deductions exceeding the group's actual third-party interest expense, as subsidiaries pay interest to affiliates that may face little or no taxation. Third, both third-party and intragroup financing may fund the acquisition of assets generating tax-exempt income, creating mismatches between deductible costs and non-taxable returns.

The ease of implementing interest-based planning makes it particularly attractive. Unlike complex restructurings involving intellectual property or supply chain arrangements, intragroup debt can be established rapidly through accounting entries without requiring physical asset transfers or operational changes. This flexibility has made excessive interest deductions a primary target for anti-BEPS measures.

#### 1.2. Revenue Implications and Scale of the Problem

The revenue consequences of interest-based profit shifting are substantial. OECD research indicates that base erosion and profit shifting reduces global corporate income tax revenue by between four and ten percent annually, amounting to USD 100-240 billion in lost tax revenue. Interest deductions constitute a significant component of these losses, with studies demonstrating that multinational enterprises systematically locate higher debt in higher-tax jurisdictions to maximise the value of interest deductions.

The arm's length principle alone has proven insufficient to address these concerns. While transfer pricing rules can examine whether interest rates on intragroup loans are appropriate, they do not effectively limit the quantum of debt a multinational may allocate to particular jurisdictions. A loan bearing an arm's length interest rate may nonetheless represent excessive leverage designed primarily for tax reduction rather than commercial purposes. This recognition led to the conclusion that specific interest limitation rules, operating independently of transfer pricing requirements, are necessary to protect tax bases effectively.

### 2. The BEPS Action 4 Best Practice Approach

#### 2.1. Fixed Ratio Rule Recommendations

The core recommendation of Action 4 is the fixed ratio rule, which limits an entity's net interest deductions to a specified percentage of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. The OECD recommends that countries set this ratio within a corridor of 10 to 30 percent, allowing flexibility based on domestic revenue needs and policy preferences.

Under a 30 percent fixed ratio, an entity with EBITDA of EUR 100 million could deduct net interest expense up to EUR 30 million. Interest exceeding this threshold would be disallowed in the current period. The fixed ratio applies to net interest expense—total interest payments less interest income received—recognising that entities receiving substantial interest income from third parties or affiliates have genuine financing activities that should not be unduly restricted.

The fixed ratio approach offers several advantages over traditional thin capitalisation rules based on debt-to-equity ratios. By linking deductibility to earnings capacity rather than balance sheet metrics, the rule relates interest deductions to the entity's ability to service debt. This earnings-based approach is considered more robust against manipulation, as EBITDA is subject to regular audit and cannot be inflated as easily as equity values through accounting adjustments or related-party transactions. *(covered in December 2024)*

Most implementing jurisdictions have adopted 30 percent as their fixed ratio, creating substantial international convergence. Within the European Union, 16 of 17 member states that have implemented interest limitation rules use the 30 percent threshold, reflecting the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive's baseline requirement. This convergence reduces opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and provides predictability for multinational groups operating across multiple jurisdictions.

#### 2.2. Group Ratio Rule as Alternative

The fixed ratio rule may disadvantage entities whose multinational groups are legitimately highly leveraged for commercial rather than tax-driven reasons. Infrastructure companies, utilities, real estate enterprises, and other capital-intensive businesses often maintain higher leverage reflecting their stable cash flows and asset-backed financing. For these entities, the group ratio rule provides an alternative mechanism.

Under the group ratio rule, an entity may deduct interest up to the higher of the fixed ratio or the group's net third-party interest expense as a percentage of consolidated group EBITDA. If a multinational group pays 40 percent of its consolidated EBITDA to external lenders, entities within that group may claim deductions at 40 percent rather than being limited to the 30 percent fixed ratio.

The group ratio calculation uses only third-party debt, excluding intercompany financing arrangements. This design prevents groups from manipulating the ratio through internal restructuring while recognising that legitimate business leverage often reflects industry characteristics and capital market conditions rather than tax planning. The 2016 technical update to Action 4 provided detailed guidance on calculating group ratios, including treatment of negative EBITDA entities and the prevention of excessive deductions through upper limits tied to actual group interest expense.

While the group ratio offers flexibility, it substantially increases compliance burden. Calculating the consolidated group's net interest expense and EBITDA requires access to group-level financial information that may not be readily available to subsidiary finance teams. The complexity of these calculations has led some commentators to suggest that the group ratio may be more beneficial in theory than in practice, particularly for entities in jurisdictions with lower fixed ratios that effectively compel use of the more complex alternative.

#### 2.3. De Minimis and Carryforward Provisions

Most jurisdictions implementing Action 4 include de minimis thresholds that exempt entities with low net interest expense from compliance requirements. The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive establishes EUR 3 million as the standard safe harbour, with entities below this threshold able to deduct all interest regardless of their EBITDA ratio.

De minimis provisions recognise that small and medium enterprises pose minimal base erosion risk and that imposing complex earnings-based calculations on these entities would be disproportionate. The administrative costs of compliance would often exceed any revenue protection achieved. However, the EUR 3 million threshold has faced criticism as too low in periods of elevated interest rates, with business groups calling for increases to reduce the number of enterprises affected by interest limitations.

Action 4 permits but does not require carryforward of disallowed interest expense. Where jurisdictions allow carryforward, entities that exceed the fixed ratio in one period may claim deductions in future periods when they have unused capacity. Some jurisdictions also permit carryforward of unused interest capacity, allowing entities with low current interest expense to "bank" allowance for future use.

The treatment of carryforwards varies significantly across implementing jurisdictions. Some countries permit indefinite carryforward of disallowed interest, while others impose time limits or restrict utilisation following ownership changes. This variation creates planning considerations for multinational groups and can affect the present value of interest deductions depending on expected future earnings and interest expense patterns.

#### 2.4. Targeted Rules for Specific Risks

Beyond the fixed and group ratio rules, Action 4 recommends targeted provisions to address specific BEPS risks. These include rules addressing equity stripping through debt-funded distributions, provisions ensuring that payments economically equivalent to interest are captured, and measures preventing manipulation through hybrid instruments that receive inconsistent treatment across jurisdictions.

Countries may also apply specific approaches to banking and insurance sectors, where standard EBITDA-based rules are poorly suited to business models that generate substantial interest income as core revenue. The 2016 update provided extensive guidance on these sectors, recognising that regulatory capital requirements and prudential supervision already constrain leverage in ways that reduce BEPS opportunities compared to industrial enterprises.

### 3. Implementation Status and Variations

#### 3.1. Global Adoption Patterns

Action 4 has achieved substantial global implementation despite its status as best practice rather than minimum standard. EU member states were required to implement interest limitation rules meeting Directive requirements by January 2019, with extensions available for jurisdictions with equally effective existing rules.

Outside the European Union, implementation has been more varied. The United States reformed Section 163(j) through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, adopting a 30 percent adjusted taxable income limitation effective from 2018. Australia comprehensively revised its thin capitalisation rules in 2024, replacing debt-to-equity ratios with EBITDA-based tests. Canada implemented its Excessive Interest and Financing Expenses Limitation rules as a direct BEPS Action 4 response.

Approximately 24 countries have implemented fixed ratio rules, though approaches vary in threshold percentages, group ratio availability, de minimis amounts, and carryforward treatment. This variation reflects both policy preferences and practical constraints, with some jurisdictions adopting stricter limitations to maximise revenue protection while others prioritise minimising compliance burden.

#### 3.2. Sector-Specific Considerations

Financial institutions present particular challenges for EBITDA-based interest limitation. Banks and insurance companies are typically net receivers of interest, with interest income from lending activities exceeding interest expense on deposits and funding. Applying fixed ratio rules designed for industrial enterprises would have limited effect, as these entities naturally satisfy earnings-based tests.

More significantly, regulatory capital requirements already constrain leverage in financial services. Basel III and IV impose strict limits on bank borrowing, while Solvency II governs insurance company capital structures. These prudential requirements reduce the scope for tax-motivated leverage independent of any interest limitation rules.

Action 4 acknowledges these differences, permitting countries to exempt banking and insurance groups from fixed and group ratio rules where no material BEPS risks are identified. Where countries identify continuing concerns, the guidance recommends tailored approaches reflecting the distinctive characteristics of financial sector business models rather than mechanical application of rules designed for other industries.

### 4. Treaty Interaction and Obligations

#### 4.1. Relationship with Article 9 (Associated Enterprises)

A fundamental question for interest limitation rules concerns their relationship with treaty obligations. Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention requires that profits between associated enterprises be allocated according to the arm's length principle. Some commentators argued that interest limitation rules disallowing deductions for arm's length interest payments conflicted with this requirement.

The November 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention Commentary definitively resolved this question. Revised paragraphs in the Article 9 Commentary confirm that domestic interest limitation rules are compatible with treaty obligations. The Commentary now explicitly states that once profits are allocated using the arm's length principle, "it is for the domestic law of each State to decide if and how the profits are taxed, including the deductibility of expenses, in conformity with the treaty."

This clarification establishes that transfer pricing and interest limitation operate as distinct regimes addressing different concerns. Transfer pricing determines whether the interest rate charged between related parties is appropriate. Interest limitation rules subsequently determine how much of that appropriately-priced interest may be deducted, regardless of whether the pricing is arm's length. The 2025 update specifically cites BEPS Action 4 fixed and group ratio rules as examples of compatible domestic provisions.

#### 4.2. Relationship with Article 11 (Interest)

Article 11 governs the taxation of interest payments in source countries, typically permitting limited withholding taxation subject to treaty rate ceilings. Interest limitation rules do not directly conflict with Article 11 provisions, which address source country taxation of cross-border payments rather than residence country deductibility.

However, practical interactions arise where interest limitation rules deny deductions while Article 11 permits source taxation. If an entity cannot deduct interest expense, but the recipient remains subject to withholding tax on the payment, economic double taxation may result. The payment is taxed in the recipient's hands without corresponding relief through deduction in the payer's jurisdiction.

Article 11 does not guarantee deductibility in the payer's jurisdiction. The right to limited source taxation operates independently of residence country rules on expense recognition. Countries retain authority to limit deductions through domestic law provisions that do not discriminate against cross-border payments relative to domestic transactions.

#### 4.3. Non-Discrimination Considerations (Article 24)

Article 24 requires that enterprises owned or controlled by residents of the other contracting state not be subjected to taxation more burdensome than that applied to similar domestic enterprises. Interest limitation rules must be applied consistently regardless of whether interest is paid to domestic or foreign lenders, and regardless of whether the paying entity is domestically or foreign-owned.

The 2025 Model Commentary update confirms that non-discriminatory application of interest limitation rules satisfies Article 24 requirements. Rules limiting all entities to the same EBITDA-based threshold, without distinguishing based on the residence of lenders or owners, comply with non-discrimination obligations. The relevant comparison is whether foreign-owned enterprises face the same limitation as domestically-owned enterprises, not whether interest paid abroad is treated identically to interest paid domestically.

### 5. Balancing Base Protection with Commercial Flexibility

#### 5.1. Protecting Legitimately Leveraged Groups

A central challenge for interest limitation design is distinguishing tax-motivated leverage from commercially-driven capital structures. The group ratio rule partially addresses this concern by allowing entities in genuinely leveraged groups to deduct interest at rates exceeding the fixed ratio. However, the administrative complexity of group ratio calculations may deter utilisation even where entities would qualify. *(covered in December 2024)*

Certain industries face structural disadvantages under earnings-based limitations. Infrastructure projects with high initial capital costs and long construction periods may generate little EBITDA during development phases while incurring substantial interest expense on project financing. Real estate investment structures similarly involve significant leverage relative to rental income. For these sectors, interest limitations may restrict financing that serves genuine commercial purposes rather than base erosion objectives.

Some jurisdictions address these concerns through specific exemptions for public benefit projects or long-term infrastructure investments. These carve-outs recognise that certain financing arrangements lack BEPS characteristics even where leverage exceeds normal commercial parameters, particularly where projects involve public sector participation or regulated returns.

#### 5.2. Administrative Burden Considerations

The compliance burden of interest limitation rules has increased as implementation has expanded. Entities must calculate net interest expense, determine applicable EBITDA, assess group ratio eligibility, track carryforward amounts, and maintain documentation supporting these calculations across multiple jurisdictions with varying rules.

For tax administrations, enforcement requires analysis of group structures, verification of EBITDA calculations, and assessment of whether entities properly applied fixed or group ratios. These requirements demand resources that may be scarce, particularly in developing countries that face the greatest revenue losses from base erosion.

The complexity of BEPS Action 4 implementation has prompted calls for simplification. Rising interest rates have brought more entities within scope of limitations, expanding both taxpayer compliance costs and administrative enforcement obligations. Some commentators suggest that the rules, designed in a low-interest-rate environment, may require recalibration for current economic conditions.

#### 5.3. Coordination and Dispute Resolution

Where interest limitation rules in one jurisdiction deny deductions while the corresponding interest income is taxable in another jurisdiction, economic double taxation results. The mutual agreement procedure under Article 25 provides a mechanism for addressing such situations, though resolution is neither automatic nor guaranteed.

Advance pricing agreements may reduce uncertainty for taxpayers by confirming that proposed financing arrangements will be accepted by relevant tax administrations. Bilateral and multilateral APAs can address both transfer pricing questions regarding interest rates and the application of interest limitation rules, though the complexity and time required for these agreements may limit their practical availability.

### 6. Recent Developments and Future Directions

#### 6.1. Interaction with Pillar Two

The relationship between BEPS Action 4 and Pillar Two global minimum tax rules requires careful analysis. Both regimes address base erosion, but through different mechanisms. Action 4 limits interest deductions directly, while Pillar Two ensures minimum effective taxation regardless of how taxable income is computed.

Interest limitation rules affect the calculation of Pillar Two effective tax rates by reducing deductions and increasing taxable income. Entities subject to strict interest limitations may have higher effective tax rates that reduce or eliminate Pillar Two top-up tax liability. However, the interaction between these regimes is not fully harmonised, and multinational groups must model both sets of rules when evaluating financing structures.

#### 6.2. November 2025 OECD Model Update

The November 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention represented the first comprehensive revision since 2017. Changes to the Commentary on Articles 7, 9, and 24 directly addressed interest limitation issues, confirming treaty compatibility and providing guidance on corresponding adjustments where limitations create economic double taxation.

These developments strengthen the legal foundation for Action 4 implementation by reducing treaty-based challenges to domestic interest limitation rules. Countries implementing Action 4 recommendations now have explicit OECD endorsement that their rules are consistent with treaty obligations, provided application is non-discriminatory.

#### 6.3. Future Considerations

The effectiveness of Action 4 continues to be evaluated as implementation matures and economic conditions evolve. The 30 percent fixed ratio has faced criticism from some quarters as too generous, with research suggesting that most large multinational enterprises operate well below this threshold. Others argue that the ratio is too restrictive for capital-intensive industries and during periods of high interest rates.

Ongoing OECD work addresses the interaction between interest limitation rules and other anti-BEPS measures, including hybrid mismatch rules and controlled foreign company provisions. Coordination among these overlapping regimes is essential to prevent both double taxation and double non-taxation outcomes. The evolution of Action 4 implementation will continue to reflect the tension between robust base protection and accommodation of legitimate commercial financing needs.
