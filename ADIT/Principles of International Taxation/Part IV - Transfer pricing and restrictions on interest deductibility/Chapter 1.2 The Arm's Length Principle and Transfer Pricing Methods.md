## Chapter 1.2: The Arm's Length Principle and Transfer Pricing Methods

### 1. Foundations of the Arm's Length Principle

#### 1.1. Definition and Rationale

The arm's length principle (ALP) represents the international standard for determining the pricing of transactions between associated enterprises for tax purposes. Under this principle, the conditions made or imposed between related parties in their commercial or financial relations should be those which would be made between independent enterprises dealing at arm's length in comparable circumstances. This foundational concept underpins virtually all national transfer pricing regimes and bilateral tax treaties worldwide.

The rationale for the arm's length principle rests on several key policy objectives. First, it seeks to ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights between countries by preventing the artificial shifting of profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions through manipulated intercompany pricing. Second, it aims to place multinational enterprises (MNEs) and independent enterprises on equal footing for tax purposes, thereby preventing competitive distortions that could arise if related-party transactions were taxed differently from third-party transactions. Third, it provides a relatively objective standard based on market conditions rather than arbitrary allocation formulas, which helps reduce double taxation and promotes international trade and investment.

The arm's length principle recognizes the economic reality that market forces operating between independent parties produce prices that reflect supply, demand, and competitive conditions. By requiring associated enterprises to transact as if they were independent, the principle attempts to replicate these market outcomes for tax purposes, thereby ensuring that the profits reported in each jurisdiction reflect the economic activities and value creation occurring there.

#### 1.2. The Separate Entity Approach

Central to the arm's length principle is the separate entity approach, which treats each member of a multinational group as a distinct entity rather than as inseparable parts of a single unified business. This approach contrasts sharply with the unitary taxation model discussed in Chapter 1.1, which views the multinational group as a single economic unit whose profits should be allocated among jurisdictions based on predetermined formulas.

Under the separate entity approach, each associated enterprise is analyzed individually to determine its appropriate share of profits based on the functions it performs, the assets it employs, and the risks it assumes. This requires identifying the controlled transactions between group members and determining what independent enterprises would have charged or paid for similar transactions under similar circumstances. The separate entity approach aligns with corporate law principles that recognize subsidiaries as legally distinct entities, even when wholly owned by a parent company.

However, the separate entity approach faces inherent challenges when applied to highly integrated multinational groups. Many valuable assets and capabilities of MNEs—such as global supply chains, centralized management expertise, synergies from integration, and group-wide intangibles—do not exist at the level of individual group members but rather emerge from the coordinated activities of the entire group. This tension between legal form and economic substance has generated ongoing debates about whether the arm's length principle adequately captures value creation in modern global business.

#### 1.3. International Consensus and Legal Framework

The arm's length principle has achieved remarkable international consensus, being endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN), and incorporated into the domestic legislation of virtually all major economies. This widespread acceptance reflects both the principle's theoretical appeal and the practical difficulties of achieving agreement on alternative approaches such as global formulary apportionment.

The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, first published in 1995 and regularly updated, provide the most comprehensive and widely followed interpretation of the arm's length principle. These Guidelines represent a consensus view among OECD member countries and increasingly influence non-OECD jurisdictions as well. While not legally binding, the Guidelines are incorporated by reference into many national laws and are routinely cited by courts and tax authorities worldwide.

Most bilateral tax treaties include provisions based on the arm's length principle, typically modeled on Article 9 of the OECD or UN Model Tax Conventions. Domestic transfer pricing legislation in countries ranging from the United States to China, from Germany to India, explicitly adopts the arm's length standard, though implementation details and enforcement approaches vary significantly. This convergence around a common principle facilitates international cooperation on transfer pricing matters and provides a shared framework for resolving disputes.

### 2. Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention

#### 2.1. Article 9(1): The Primary Adjustment Mechanism

Article 9(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides the treaty-level foundation for applying the arm's length principle. The provision states:

"Where a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly."

This provision establishes three essential elements that must be present before a transfer pricing adjustment can be made. First, there must be associated enterprises, meaning entities connected through participation in management, control, or capital. This encompasses parent-subsidiary relationships, sister companies under common control, and more complex ownership structures involving indirect control. Second, the conditions made or imposed between these associated enterprises in their commercial or financial relations must differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises. Third, as a result of these non-arm's length conditions, profits that would have accrued to one enterprise have instead accrued to the other.

When these conditions are met, Article 9(1) authorizes a Contracting State to include in the profits of the enterprise in its jurisdiction—and tax accordingly—the profits that would have accrued under arm's length conditions. This is known as a primary adjustment. The application of Article 9(1) requires a comparability analysis to determine what independent enterprises would have agreed to under comparable circumstances, a complex undertaking that forms the core of transfer pricing analysis (examined in June 2022).

The "may" language in Article 9(1) indicates that the provision grants countries the authority to make adjustments but does not mandate them. This reflects the principle that transfer pricing adjustments should be made only when there is clear evidence that conditions differ materially from arm's length, not merely because some theoretical alternative pricing could be justified.

#### 2.2. Article 9(2): Corresponding Adjustments

Article 9(2) addresses the problem of double taxation that arises when one country makes a primary adjustment under Article 9(1). The provision states:

"Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits."

This provision creates an obligation for the second country (where the associated enterprise resides) to make a corresponding adjustment to relieve double taxation, provided that the primary adjustment is justified under the arm's length principle. If Country A increases the taxable profits of Company A by EUR 10 million based on an Article 9(1) adjustment, and Country B agrees that this adjustment is appropriate, then Country B must correspondingly reduce the taxable profits of Company B (the associated enterprise) by an equivalent amount.

The corresponding adjustment mechanism is essential for maintaining the integrity of the arm's length principle. Without it, taxpayers would face taxation on the same profits in two jurisdictions—once at the original transfer price and again at the adjusted arm's length price. However, Article 9(2) is not automatic; the second country is obligated to provide relief only if it agrees that the profits would indeed have accrued to the enterprise in the first country under arm's length conditions.

Disputes over the appropriateness of primary adjustments and corresponding adjustments are among the most common issues arising under tax treaties. The mutual agreement procedure (MAP) provided in Article 25 of the Model Convention serves as the primary mechanism for resolving such disputes between competent authorities.

#### 2.3. UN Model Differences

While the UN Model Tax Convention's Article 9 is substantially similar to the OECD version, the UN Model's Commentary reflects certain differences in emphasis that matter particularly for developing countries. The UN Commentary acknowledges that developing countries may have more limited access to comparable data and may face greater challenges in applying sophisticated transfer pricing methods, which has implications for how broadly or narrowly one interprets the arm's length principle.

Additionally, some developing countries have advocated for explicit recognition in Article 9 of concepts like "location savings" and "market premium"—sources of value that may arise from operating in particular geographic locations. While these concepts can be accommodated within the OECD's arm's length framework through appropriate comparability adjustments, developing countries sometimes prefer explicit treaty language to ensure these factors are considered.

### 3. Comparability Analysis

#### 3.1. The Central Role of Comparability

Comparability analysis forms the analytical foundation of applying the arm's length principle. To determine whether the conditions of a controlled transaction are consistent with the arm's length principle, one must compare those conditions with the conditions that would have been established between independent enterprises in comparable transactions under comparable circumstances. The degree of comparability between a controlled transaction and an uncontrolled transaction directly affects the reliability of the latter as a benchmark for evaluating the former.

Perfect comparability is rarely achievable in practice, particularly for complex transactions involving unique intangibles, integrated business models, or multifaceted arrangements. Therefore, transfer pricing analysis seeks reasonably reliable comparables—transactions or entities that are sufficiently similar to the controlled transaction that they provide meaningful guidance on arm's length conditions. When differences exist between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, adjustments may be made to eliminate the effects of such differences on price or profit, provided that reasonably accurate adjustments can be made.

The reliability of a comparability analysis depends on the completeness and accuracy of the information available about both the controlled transaction and potentially comparable uncontrolled transactions. This creates significant practical challenges, as detailed information about the terms and circumstances of third-party transactions is often confidential or unavailable. Commercial databases containing financial information on independent companies have become essential tools for comparability analysis, though they have limitations in terms of the level of detail and transaction-specific information they provide.

#### 3.2. The Five Comparability Factors

The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines identify five comparability factors that must be considered when determining the degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions:

First, the characteristics of the property or services transferred significantly affect their value in the open market. For tangible goods, relevant characteristics include physical features, quality, reliability, and availability. For services, relevant characteristics include the nature and extent of the services. For intangible property, characteristics such as the form of the transaction (licensing versus sale), the type of property (patent, trademark, know-how), the duration and degree of protection, and the anticipated benefits from the property's use are critical.

Second, the functional analysis examines the functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed by each party to the transaction. Functions include activities such as design, manufacturing, assembly, research and development, procurement, distribution, marketing, advertising, transportation, financing, and management. Assets encompass both tangible assets (plant, equipment, inventory) and intangible assets (patents, trademarks, trade names, customer lists). Risks include market risks, inventory risks, credit and collection risks, product liability risks, and entrepreneurial risks. The allocation of functions, assets, and risks between the parties fundamentally determines the expected division of profits.

Third, contractual terms define how responsibilities, risks, and benefits are allocated between the parties. Relevant contractual provisions include payment terms, volume commitments, warranty provisions, service level agreements, and rights to updates or revisions. While written contracts are important evidence of the intended terms, the actual conduct of the parties provides the definitive evidence of the terms of the transaction.

Fourth, economic circumstances such as geographic location, market size, market level (wholesale versus retail), competitive position, availability of substitute goods or services, supply and demand levels, costs of production and distribution, transport costs, government regulations, and overall economic conditions all affect market prices and must be considered in comparability analysis.

Fifth, business strategies pursued by the parties affect pricing decisions and profitability. Strategies such as market penetration (accepting lower profits initially to establish market share), market exit strategies, product diversification, risk aversion, and strategic positioning may result in independent enterprises accepting different terms or profitability levels than they would under different strategic circumstances.

#### 3.3. Functional Analysis

Among the five comparability factors, functional analysis deserves particular emphasis as it provides the foundation for understanding how value is created in controlled transactions. The functional analysis identifies and compares the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken by the parties involved in the controlled transaction with those undertaken by parties in potentially comparable uncontrolled transactions.

A thorough functional analysis examines not only what functions are performed but also how significant each function is to value creation. For instance, in a distribution arrangement, one must determine whether the distributor performs merely logistics functions or also engages in market development, assumes inventory risk, provides warranty services, or conducts local marketing. The significance of assets employed must also be assessed; using valuable intangible assets or significant working capital implies entitlement to higher returns than performing routine functions with minimal assets.

Risk analysis forms a critical component of functional analysis. Under the arm's length principle, the assumption of greater risk is generally compensated by the opportunity to earn higher returns (or the possibility of suffering larger losses). The BEPS project emphasized that contractual risk allocation must be respected only when the party assuming risk actually controls the risk through decision-making capabilities and has the financial capacity to assume the risk—concepts explored further in Section 5 below.

### 4. The Five Transfer Pricing Methods

#### 4.1. Traditional Transaction Methods

The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines recognize five primary transfer pricing methods, which fall into two categories: traditional transaction methods and transactional profit methods. The three traditional transaction methods directly examine the pricing of transactions between related parties compared to comparable uncontrolled transactions.

The Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method compares the price charged for property or services transferred in a controlled transaction to the price charged for property or services transferred in a comparable uncontrolled transaction under comparable circumstances. If the two prices differ, this may indicate that the conditions of the controlled transaction are not arm's length, and the price in the uncontrolled transaction may need to replace the price in the controlled transaction. The CUP method is generally considered the most direct and reliable method when sufficiently comparable uncontrolled transactions can be identified, but it requires a high degree of comparability regarding the property or services transferred, the contractual terms, and the economic circumstances. For example, if a pharmaceutical company sells a generic drug to both related and unrelated distributors under similar terms and circumstances, the price charged to unrelated parties provides a strong CUP for transactions with related distributors.

The Resale Price Method begins with the price at which a product purchased from a related party is resold to an independent party. This resale price is reduced by an appropriate gross margin (the resale price margin) representing the amount from which the reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and make an appropriate profit in light of the functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed. The remaining amount can be regarded as an arm's length price for the original transfer between the related parties. This method is most useful when applied to distribution activities where the reseller adds relatively limited value through marketing and distribution functions. For instance, if independent distributors of comparable products in comparable markets earn gross margins of 25-30%, a related-party distributor performing similar functions should earn a similar margin.

The Cost Plus Method begins with the costs incurred by the supplier of property or services in a controlled transaction for property transferred or services provided to a related buyer. An appropriate cost plus markup is then added to this cost to make an appropriate profit in light of the functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed. The resulting figure is regarded as an arm's length price for the controlled transaction. This method is particularly applicable to manufacturing activities, contract service arrangements, and semi-finished goods transactions. For example, if independent contract manufacturers in the electronics industry earn cost plus markups of 8-12% for similar manufacturing services, a related-party contract manufacturer should earn a comparable markup.

#### 4.2. Transactional Profit Methods

The two transactional profit methods examine the profits arising from particular controlled transactions, comparing them to profits earned in comparable uncontrolled transactions or by comparable independent enterprises.

The Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) examines the net profit margin relative to an appropriate base (such as costs, sales, or assets) that a taxpayer realizes from a controlled transaction. This net margin is compared to the same net margin realized by the same taxpayer in comparable uncontrolled transactions or by independent enterprises in comparable transactions. A profit level indicator (PLI) such as return on sales, return on costs, return on assets, or Berry ratio (gross profit to operating expenses) is selected based on the nature of the controlled transaction and the availability of reliable data. For instance, if independent contract manufacturers earn net profit margins of 4-6% on total costs, a related-party contract manufacturer performing comparable functions should earn margins within a similar range.

TNMM has become one of the most frequently applied methods in practice because it is less sensitive to transaction-level differences than traditional transaction methods and because reliable financial data on independent companies is more readily available than transaction-specific pricing data. However, TNMM requires careful functional comparability between the tested party and the independent comparables, and differences in functions, assets, risks, business strategies, and efficiency can significantly affect net profit margins.

The Profit Split Method divides the combined profits (or losses) from controlled transactions between the associated enterprises based on the relative value of each enterprise's contribution to those combined profits. This division seeks to approximate the division of profits that would have been achieved if the parties had been independent enterprises engaged in a similar joint activity. The profit split may be based on the relative contributions of the parties, measured by functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed, or on the residual analysis approach, which first allocates routine returns to routine contributions and then splits the residual profit based on non-routine contributions such as valuable intangibles.

The Profit Split Method is particularly appropriate for highly integrated operations where neither party can be meaningfully characterized as performing only routine functions, for transactions involving unique and valuable intangibles contributed by both parties, or where both parties to the transaction assume significant economically important risks. For example, in a global trading arrangement where one party provides proprietary trading algorithms and market expertise while another party provides capital and risk management capabilities, profit split may be the most appropriate method.

#### 4.3. Method Selection

The selection of the most appropriate transfer pricing method depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the controlled transaction, the availability of reliable information, and the degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions. No single method is suitable for all cases, and different methods may be appropriate for different controlled transactions within the same multinational group.

While the OECD Guidelines do not establish a strict hierarchy among methods, they express a preference for traditional transaction methods when these can be reliably applied, as they provide a more direct comparison of transaction pricing. However, when reliable comparable uncontrolled transaction data is unavailable or when the controlled transaction involves highly integrated or unique elements, transactional profit methods may provide more reliable results.

The concept of the "most appropriate method" requires consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods in relation to the controlled transaction, the degree of comparability between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, the availability of reliable data, and the degree of accuracy with which adjustments can be made to eliminate material differences between comparable and controlled transactions. Taxpayers should select the method that provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result under the specific circumstances.

### 5. BEPS Actions 8-10 and Value Creation

#### 5.1. Aligning Profits with Value Creation

The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, launched by the OECD and G20 countries in 2013, represented a comprehensive effort to address gaps and mismatches in international tax rules that allowed profits to be shifted to low-tax jurisdictions where little or no economic activity occurred. Actions 8-10 of the BEPS Action Plan focused specifically on ensuring that transfer pricing outcomes align with value creation, a principle that has fundamentally reshaped the application of the arm's length principle (covered in December 2024).

The BEPS transfer pricing guidance reaffirmed the arm's length principle as the international standard but clarified and strengthened its application to prevent outcomes that divorce profits from the location of value-creating activities. The central insight was that merely owning an asset, providing funding, or bearing contractual risk should not automatically entitle an entity to the returns associated with that asset, funding, or risk unless the entity also performs the important decision-making functions that control the risk and contribute to value creation.

This value creation emphasis represented a significant evolution in transfer pricing analysis. Previously, legal ownership of intangible assets or contractual assumption of risk could be sufficient to justify significant profit allocations, even if the entity owning the asset or assuming the risk performed minimal actual functions. The post-BEPS approach requires a more substance-based analysis that looks beyond legal form to examine which entities actually perform, control, and bear the economically significant functions, assets, and risks.

#### 5.2. DEMPE Functions for Intangibles

Actions 8-10 introduced the DEMPE framework for analyzing transactions involving intangible assets. DEMPE stands for Development, Enhancement, Maintenance, Protection, and Exploitation of intangibles. Under this framework, the arm's length allocation of returns from intangibles requires identifying which entities perform and control the DEMPE functions and proportionately allocating returns to those entities.

Development refers to activities that create intangible assets, such as research activities that lead to patents or marketing activities that build brand value. Enhancement encompasses activities that augment the value of existing intangibles, such as improvements to patented technology or brand extension into new markets. Maintenance includes activities necessary to preserve the value of intangibles, such as ongoing quality control or brand protection efforts. Protection covers legal and strategic activities that safeguard intangible rights, such as patent prosecution, trademark registration, and enforcement against infringement. Exploitation refers to activities that realize value from intangibles, such as manufacturing products embodying patents or licensing trademarks to third parties.

The DEMPE framework recognizes that mere legal ownership of an intangible, unaccompanied by performance and control of DEMPE functions, does not justify receiving all returns associated with the intangible. If Company A legally owns a patent but Company B actually conducts the research and development, makes key decisions about the research direction, and employs the scientists who create improvements to the patented technology, then Company B should receive a significant portion of the returns from the intangible, even though Company A is the legal owner.

#### 5.3. Risk and Capital Allocation

Similarly, the BEPS guidance on risk emphasizes that contractual risk allocation must be respected only when accompanied by control over risk and financial capacity to assume risk. Control over risk requires performing important decision-making functions related to taking on, laying off, or managing the risk, including strategic decisions about whether and how to respond to the risks and ongoing monitoring of the risk.

An entity that merely contractually assumes risk but lacks the capability to make relevant decisions about the risk should receive only a risk-free return on its capital, not the entrepreneurial returns associated with risk-bearing. For example, if a cash-rich subsidiary is contractually designated as the principal bearing market and product development risks in a contract research and development arrangement, but all material decisions about the research direction, product development, and market strategy are made by personnel employed by another group member, the cash-rich subsidiary should receive only a limited, risk-free return on its funding rather than the potentially substantial entrepreneurial returns from successful product development.

This approach prevents "cash box" structures where entities with capital but minimal substance contractually assume risks and capture the associated returns. It ensures that returns for risk-bearing are allocated to entities that both financially support the risk and exercise control over it through meaningful decision-making.

### 6. Challenges and Developing Country Perspectives

#### 6.1. Practical Implementation Challenges

Despite its widespread acceptance, the arm's length principle faces significant practical implementation challenges. The principle's reliance on comparability analysis requires identifying sufficiently similar uncontrolled transactions or independent enterprises, yet such comparables are often unavailable, particularly for transactions involving unique intangibles, highly integrated business models, or emerging market economies where commercial data may be limited.

Even when potential comparables exist, obtaining reliable information about the terms, conditions, and circumstances of third-party transactions is difficult due to confidentiality and the absence of public disclosure requirements for most private transactions. Tax authorities and taxpayers must rely on imperfect proxies, commercial databases with limited detail, and assumptions that introduce uncertainty into transfer pricing determinations.

The administrative burden of complying with transfer pricing rules has grown substantially, particularly in the post-BEPS environment with enhanced documentation requirements including country-by-country reporting, master files, and local files. Smaller enterprises and developing country tax administrations with limited resources face particular difficulties in meeting these requirements and conducting sophisticated transfer pricing analyses.

#### 6.2. The ALP versus Formulary Apportionment Debate

The challenges of applying the arm's length principle have periodically revived debates about formulary apportionment as an alternative approach. Proponents of formulary apportionment argue that it would be simpler to administer, eliminate many compliance costs, reduce transfer pricing disputes, and more accurately reflect the integrated nature of modern multinational enterprises (discussed in June 2023).

However, formulary apportionment faces its own significant challenges, as discussed in Chapter 1.1. Achieving international agreement on the formula factors, their weighting, and the definition of the tax base would require unprecedented coordination among countries with divergent economic interests and tax policy objectives. The experience of unitary taxation in U.S. states demonstrates both the feasibility and the complexities of formulary approaches, including distortions from formula-driven behavior and ongoing disputes about appropriate formulas and apportionment factors.

The European Union's proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which would apply formulary apportionment among EU member states, has faced years of negotiation without adoption, illustrating the political difficulties of implementing formulary approaches even among economically integrated jurisdictions with existing institutional frameworks for cooperation. The international community's reaffirmation of the arm's length principle in the BEPS project and subsequent work on the Two-Pillar Solution reflects a practical judgment that, despite its imperfections, the arm's length principle remains preferable to the available alternatives.

#### 6.3. Developing Country Concerns

Developing countries have raised particular concerns about the arm's length principle's application in practice. These countries often lack the administrative capacity and resources to conduct complex transfer pricing audits and economic analyses, creating an asymmetry between their capabilities and those of the sophisticated multinational enterprises they are attempting to tax. The scarcity of reliable local comparables in many developing country markets makes it difficult to apply transfer pricing methods that depend on market data.

Developing countries have also argued that certain sources of value creation—such as location-specific advantages, cost savings from operating in lower-cost jurisdictions, and local market conditions—may not be adequately captured under traditional arm's length analyses that focus primarily on functions, assets, and risks contributed by the multinational group. This has led to advocacy for explicit recognition of location savings, market premium, and other locally-sourced value in transfer pricing frameworks.

The UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries provides guidance tailored to the particular challenges faced by developing country tax administrations, including simplified approaches for small taxpayers, commodity transaction safe harbors, and approaches for dealing with limited comparables. The UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters continues to develop practical tools and guidance addressing developing country concerns while working within the arm's length framework that commands international consensus.
