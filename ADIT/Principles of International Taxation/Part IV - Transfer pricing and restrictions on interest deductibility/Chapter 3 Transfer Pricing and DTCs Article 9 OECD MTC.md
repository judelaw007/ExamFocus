## Chapter 3: Transfer Pricing and Double Taxation Conventions – Article 9, OECD MTC

### 1. The Role of Article 9 in the International Transfer Pricing Framework

#### 1.1. Article 9 as the Treaty Foundation for the Arm's Length Principle

Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides the treaty-level foundation for the arm's length principle in international taxation. While domestic transfer pricing legislation establishes legal authority for tax administrations to adjust profits within their jurisdictions, Article 9 coordinates these adjustments across treaty partners and prevents double taxation that would otherwise arise from unilateral corrections. Without Article 9, each country could apply its own interpretation of appropriate profit allocation, leading to the same income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions with no mechanism for relief. The article operates at the intersection of domestic law and international coordination.

#### 1.2. The Relationship Between Article 9, Domestic Legislation, and the OECD Guidelines

The relationship between Article 9, domestic transfer pricing legislation, and the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines creates a three-tiered hierarchy of authority. Domestic legislation provides the legal basis for enforcement and specifies procedural requirements such as documentation and penalties. Article 9 operates at the treaty level to coordinate between jurisdictions and establish the conceptual framework of separate entity treatment. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, while lacking direct legal force except where explicitly incorporated into domestic law, provide detailed interpretive guidance on applying the arm's length principle in practice. The Commentary to Article 9 explicitly recognizes this relationship by referring to the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for detailed guidance, creating an important linkage that gives the Guidelines significant interpretive weight in treaty disputes (examined in June 2023). This three-tier structure ensures flexibility while maintaining consistency—domestic legislation can be updated to address jurisdiction-specific concerns, the Guidelines can be revised to incorporate evolving best practices, and Article 9 itself remains stable without requiring frequent renegotiation of bilateral treaties.

#### 1.3. Historical Evolution and the November 2025 Update

Article 9 has remained remarkably stable since its introduction in the 1963 OECD Draft Convention, with the most significant change being the addition of paragraph 2 in 1977 to address corresponding adjustments. The November 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention Commentary strengthens the connection between Article 9 and the Transfer Pricing Guidelines by explicitly referencing the 2022 edition as amended by the Amount B Report. Paragraph 1 of the revised Commentary now states that the arm's length principle as expressed in Article 9 should be interpreted consistently with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, providing stronger textual support for applying Guidelines methodologies in treaty contexts. The November 2025 Commentary also clarifies that Article 7 addresses attribution of profits to permanent establishments while Article 9 governs adjustments arising from non-arm's length conditions between associated enterprises. This distinction matters because Article 7 does not provide for corresponding adjustments, whereas Article 9(2) creates that obligation.

This gradual strengthening of the connection between Article 9 and the Transfer Pricing Guidelines reflects a fundamental tension in international tax treaty practice. Treaties themselves are negotiated bilaterally and change slowly, requiring ratification by both parties and often years to implement. In contrast, transfer pricing practices evolve rapidly as business models change and tax planning strategies become more sophisticated. By anchoring Article 9 to the regularly updated Transfer Pricing Guidelines through Commentary rather than treaty text, the international community has found a pragmatic solution—treaties provide stable legal authority while the Guidelines offer adaptive guidance. This approach works because most countries accept the interpretive weight of the OECD Commentary in treaty application, though countries not accepting particular Guideline provisions may enter observations or reservations to the Model Convention Commentary.

### 2. Article 9(1): Primary Adjustments to Combat Profit Shifting

#### 2.1. The Three-Part Test for Associated Enterprises

Article 9(1) authorizes transfer pricing adjustments when three cumulative conditions are satisfied. First, there must be two enterprises, one resident in each Contracting State. Second, the enterprises must be associated through participation in management, control, or capital. Third, conditions must be made or imposed in commercial or financial relations that differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises. The definition of associated enterprises encompasses direct and indirect participation in management, control, or capital. The threshold for constituting participation is intentionally not specified in Article 9 itself, allowing flexibility for domestic legislation or treaty negotiation, though most countries apply Article 9 when ownership or control exceeds 50%. The concept of "conditions made or imposed" extends beyond contractual pricing terms to encompass all aspects of commercial arrangements affecting profit allocation, including payment terms, risk assumption, guarantees, and cost savings allocation, ensuring Article 9 applies to sophisticated tax planning structures that shift profits through non-price mechanisms.

#### 2.2. Non-Arm's Length Conditions and Profit Allocation

The core operative language of Article 9(1) addresses situations where conditions differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises. When such conditions exist, profits that would have accrued to an enterprise but have not by reason of those conditions may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. This formulation establishes both a counterfactual analysis—what would independent enterprises have done—and an adjustment mechanism to tax the hypothetical arm's length profit.

The counterfactual nature of this analysis creates inherent challenges that explain much of the controversy surrounding transfer pricing. Multinational enterprises are integrated operations specifically designed to capture synergies unavailable to independent parties—they transfer proprietary technology, coordinate global supply chains, share risk through diversification, and achieve economies of scale impossible for arm's length counterparties. Asking what independent enterprises would have done assumes a hypothetical market for transactions that often do not occur between independent parties precisely because the value lies in integration. This paradox becomes acute for unique intangible assets, sophisticated financial arrangements, or business restructurings, where comparable uncontrolled transactions may not exist. Tax administrations and taxpayers must therefore construct the arm's length outcome through economic analysis and judgment rather than direct market evidence, creating opportunities for good-faith disagreement and, inevitably, controversy.

Determining what independent enterprises would have done requires comparability analysis examining economically relevant characteristics of the controlled transaction and identifying comparable uncontrolled transactions. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines specify five comparability factors: characteristics of property or services, functional analysis of the parties, contractual terms, economic circumstances, and business strategies, while detailing various transfer pricing methods including traditional transaction methods like the comparable uncontrolled price method and transactional profit methods like the transactional net margin method (covered in December 2024).

#### 2.3. The Authority to Make Primary Adjustments

Article 9(1) uses permissive rather than mandatory language, stating that profits "may" be included in the enterprise's taxable profits. This word choice reflects treaty drafting convention rather than true optionality—tax administrations are authorized but not required to make adjustments. The permissive language respects sovereignty by not compelling States to make adjustments while clearly establishing that adjustments are treaty-permitted. Article 9(1) authorizes "primary adjustments"—the initial correction by one tax administration to reflect arm's length profits. The authority to make primary adjustments exists independently of whether the other Contracting State agrees that the adjustment is appropriate, creating potential for double taxation that Article 9(2) is designed to address. Primary adjustments require adequate documentation and analysis to support the conclusion that actual conditions differed from arm's length conditions, with the burden of proof varying by jurisdiction but the substantive standard remaining the arm's length principle as elaborated in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

### 3. Article 9(2): Corresponding Adjustments and Double Taxation Relief

#### 3.1. The Obligation to Grant Corresponding Adjustments

Article 9(2) addresses the double taxation that would otherwise result from primary adjustments by obligating the other Contracting State to make a corresponding adjustment. When State A makes a primary adjustment reallocating profits from an enterprise in State B to an enterprise in State A, State B should make a corresponding adjustment by reducing the taxable profits of the enterprise in State B by an equivalent amount, ensuring the same income is not taxed twice. The corresponding adjustment obligation is conditional rather than automatic—Article 9(2) provides that the other State "shall make an appropriate adjustment" but only if it "considers the adjustment made by the first State to be justified both in principle and as regards the amount." This language creates a two-stage inquiry: State B must agree that the primary adjustment was conceptually appropriate and that the quantum accurately reflects the arm's length outcome. The conditional nature creates asymmetry between the rights of the adjusting State and the obligations of the other State, reflecting the political reality that countries resist being bound by another State's transfer pricing determinations without independent verification.

#### 3.2. Conditions and Limitations

The requirement that State B consider the adjustment "justified both in principle and as regards the amount" establishes substantive conditions for corresponding adjustments. "Justified in principle" means that the primary adjustment correctly applied the arm's length principle—the methodological approach was sound, appropriate comparables were selected, and relevant economic factors were properly considered. "Justified as regards the amount" means that the quantum accurately reflects the difference between actual and arm's length pricing.

These conditions create frequent opportunities for disagreement between tax administrations, and understanding why reveals structural tensions in the corresponding adjustment framework. Different tax administrations may have access to different comparable data, particularly when one jurisdiction has more developed public databases of financial information. Methodological preferences vary—some jurisdictions favor traditional transaction methods while others prefer profit-based approaches—and these preferences may reflect both analytical judgment and revenue considerations. When the arm's length principle produces a range of acceptable outcomes rather than a single point estimate, State A might adjust to the high end of the range (maximizing its revenue) while State B considers only the low end justified (minimizing its revenue loss). Perhaps most fundamentally, tax administrations face asymmetric incentives: State A making the primary adjustment seeks to increase its tax base, while State B granting the corresponding adjustment must accept a reduction in its tax base, creating a structural bias toward under-granting corresponding adjustments absent effective dispute resolution mechanisms.

Article 9(2) contemplates this possibility by providing that if necessary, the competent authorities "shall consult each other" to resolve disagreements, creating a soft obligation for consultation while stopping short of requiring resolution or binding arbitration.

#### 3.3. The Mutual Agreement Procedure Interface

The consultation mechanism in Article 9(2) operates alongside and often merges with the mutual agreement procedure provided in Article 25 of the Model Convention, which establishes a general framework for resolving treaty interpretation disputes and cases of taxation not in accordance with the treaty. Article 9(2) creates a specific obligation for States to consult regarding corresponding adjustments, while Article 25 provides the procedural framework and taxpayer access rights for triggering that consultation. In practice, corresponding adjustment cases are typically handled through the Article 25 MAP process, which provides established procedures, timelines, and in many treaties, mandatory arbitration provisions ensuring timely resolution. The effectiveness of corresponding adjustments depends heavily on the willingness of tax administrations to engage constructively in mutual agreement procedures, with the OECD's BEPS Action 14 seeking to improve MAP effectiveness through minimum standards for access, timeliness, and implementation.

### 4. BEPS Actions 8-10 and the Evolution of Article 9 Application

#### 4.1. Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation

The BEPS project fundamentally reoriented transfer pricing analysis around the principle that profits should be allocated to jurisdictions where value-creating activities occur. Prior to BEPS, transfer pricing analysis often relied heavily on legal ownership of assets and contractual allocations of risk, creating opportunities for profit shifting through strategic positioning of intangible property ownership in low-tax jurisdictions. BEPS Actions 8-10 sought to align transfer pricing outcomes with the substance of economic activity by emphasizing functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed. This value creation principle refines Article 9's interpretation—the arm's length principle remains the standard, but BEPS revisions clarify that arm's length analysis must look beyond legal form to economic substance. Contractual allocations of risk are respected only when the party assuming risk has financial capacity to bear it and exercises meaningful control through decision-making, while ownership of intangible assets justifies profit allocation only when the owner performs or controls the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation (DEMPE) functions related to those assets (covered in December 2024).

#### 4.2. The Impact on Article 9(1) Comparability Analysis

BEPS Actions 8-10 significantly affected how the three-part test in Article 9(1) is applied, particularly determining what conditions would be made between independent enterprises. The enhanced guidance on delineating the actual transaction requires detailed functional analysis to understand which party performs functions, controls risks, and contributes assets. The accurately delineated transaction may differ from contractual characterization if conduct is inconsistent with contractual terms.

This shift toward substance over form represents a fundamental recalibration of Article 9 application, driven by recognition that sophisticated tax planning had exploited the gap between legal arrangements and economic reality. Prior structures often involved minimal-substance entities in low-tax jurisdictions that contractually owned valuable intangibles or assumed significant risks while performing few actual functions, paying little to high-substance entities in higher-tax jurisdictions that performed the value-creating activities. BEPS closed this gap by insisting that independent parties would not accept such arrangements—a party assuming contractual risk without financial capacity to bear that risk or control over risk management would not find willing counterparties in an arm's length negotiation. This reasoning empowers tax administrations to disregard contractual allocations that lack economic substance, fundamentally changing transfer pricing analysis from document review to functional investigation.

Chapter I of the revised Transfer Pricing Guidelines establishes a framework for analyzing risk that considers contractual terms, conduct, financial capacity, and control. Similarly, Chapter VI emphasizes that legal ownership alone does not determine profit entitlement—the entity entitled to intangible-related returns is determined by analyzing which entities perform DEMPE functions, fund intangible development, and provide assets creating intangible value.

#### 4.3. Hard-to-Value Intangibles and Ex-Post Evidence

BEPS Action 8 introduced special provisions for hard-to-value intangibles (HTVI), addressing situations where reliable comparable transactions do not exist and projections about future cash flows are highly uncertain. These provisions allow tax administrations to use ex-post evidence—actual outcomes following transfer—to evaluate whether pricing reflected arm's length expectations, subject to safeguards preventing hindsight bias. When an intangible is transferred and subsequently generates profits substantially exceeding projections, tax administrations may presume pricing did not reflect arm's length terms unless the taxpayer demonstrates that differences resulted from unforeseeable developments.

The HTVI provisions were among the most contentious BEPS outputs, as they challenge a fundamental premise of the arm's length principle—that pricing should be evaluated based on information available at the time of the transaction. Taxpayers argued that using ex-post evidence violates this premise and penalizes successful innovation, since high-risk intangible investments necessarily involve significant uncertainty and successful outcomes must compensate for unsuccessful ones. Tax administrations countered that without ex-post evidence, taxpayers had systematic advantages in HTVI pricing—they possessed better information about intangible value than tax authorities could access during examination periods, and conservative ex-ante valuations were difficult to challenge even when subsequent success revealed they were implausibly low. The compromise limiting HTVI to genuinely unique, uncertain intangibles with substantial actual income reflects this tension, narrowing application while preserving tax administration tools for the most problematic cases.

The HTVI provisions apply only when specific conditions are met: the intangible is not comparable to intangibles used by independent parties, projections are highly uncertain, information on comparables is unavailable, and the intangible generates substantial income. These conditions limit HTVI application to genuinely unique, high-value intangibles.

### 5. Amount B and Simplified Transfer Pricing for Baseline Distribution

#### 5.1. The February 2024 Framework

The OECD's February 2024 Amount B Report represents a significant development in applying Article 9 to baseline marketing and distribution activities, emerging from recognition that the administrative burden of transfer pricing compliance and enforcement falls disproportionately on routine, low-value-adding transactions. Tax administrations and taxpayers alike invest substantial resources preparing, reviewing, and auditing documentation for distributors performing standardized functions with limited profit potential, diverting attention from high-risk profit-shifting arrangements where enforcement resources would be better deployed. Developing countries particularly emphasized this concern, noting that their limited administrative capacity was consumed examining distribution arrangements while lacking resources to address complex intangible and financing transactions. Amount B responds to this reality by providing a simplified, standardized approach for the routine cases, freeing resources for both taxpayers and tax administrations to focus on transactions where transfer pricing analysis genuinely matters.

Amount B is not a new treaty provision but rather an optional simplified approach to determining arm's length returns for qualifying distribution activities, providing a pricing matrix specifying returns on sales for distributors performing routine buy-sell distribution functions. The Amount B framework establishes qualification criteria based on functional profile, operating expense to sales ratios, and transaction types. Qualified distributors purchase goods from related parties and resell to independent customers without materially altering products or assuming unusual risks. For qualifying transactions, the Amount B matrix provides return on sales percentages calibrated by jurisdiction and industry, developed through extensive comparability analysis, providing statistically derived safe harbors that offer taxpayers certainty while reducing tax administration audit resources.

#### 5.2. Integration with Article 9

Amount B operates within the existing Article 9 framework rather than creating an exception to it, with the simplified pricing reflecting the arm's length principle as applied to baseline distribution activities—an administratively efficient method for determining what independent enterprises would agree to for comparable distribution functions. The voluntary nature of Amount B reflects the permissive language in Article 9(1)—tax administrations "may" make adjustments, with countries adopting Amount B committing that transfer pricing falling within Amount B parameters will not be subject to Article 9(1) primary adjustments for covered transactions. The interaction with Article 9(2) becomes relevant when one jurisdiction adopts Amount B while its treaty partner does not, potentially creating double taxation if one jurisdiction makes a primary adjustment while the other refuses a corresponding adjustment based on its view that the adjustment is not "justified both in principle and as regards the amount."

#### 5.3. Jurisdictional Adoption and Implementation Challenges

Jurisdictional adoption of Amount B has proceeded unevenly since the February 2024 release. The United States issued Notice 2025-04 announcing that Amount B will be available as an elective safe harbor for US taxpayers engaged in baseline distribution activities. Developing countries have raised particular concerns about Amount B's impact on their tax base, as many developing country markets exhibit characteristics—location savings, market premiums, local intangibles—that may justify distributor returns exceeding Amount B benchmarks. If Amount B returns are calibrated based on developed market comparables, applying them in developing countries could result in under-taxation of distribution profits. Implementation challenges also arise from the interaction between Amount B and existing transfer pricing documentation requirements, with taxpayers still required to prepare functional analyses demonstrating that their distributors meet qualification criteria.

### 6. Comparative Perspectives: UN Model and Developing Country Concerns

#### 6.1. Textual Similarities and Commentary Differences

Article 9 of the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention closely parallels the OECD Model's Article 9 in paragraphs 1 and 2, with both treaties authorizing transfer pricing adjustments when conditions between associated enterprises differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises and providing for corresponding adjustments. However, the UN Model includes an additional paragraph 3 not found in the OECD Model, which provides that corresponding adjustments under paragraph 2 shall not apply where legal proceedings have resulted in a final ruling that one of the enterprises is liable to penalty with respect to fraud, gross negligence or wilful default. This substantial similarity in paragraphs 1 and 2 reflects broad international consensus on the separate entity principle as the foundation for allocating profits among associated enterprises. The divergence between UN and OECD approaches appears both in the treaty text (paragraph 3) and in the Commentary, with the UN Commentary including additional discussion of concerns particularly relevant to developing countries. The UN Commentary addresses location savings, noting that developing countries may offer cost advantages through lower labor costs or raw material availability, suggesting that benefits should be appropriately allocated between associated enterprises rather than automatically accruing to developed country parents. The UN Commentary also addresses market premiums and local market intangibles, with developing country tax administrations contending that local entities contributing to brand development should share in resulting profits.

#### 6.2. Developing Country Advocacy for Location-Specific Advantages

Developing countries have consistently advocated for transfer pricing methodologies that recognize location-specific advantages and local value contributions, arguing that traditional application of the arm's length principle systematically disadvantages developing countries by treating local entities as routine service providers earning minimal returns while allocating residual profits to developed country parents that legally own intangibles and assume contractual risks. The practical challenge is operationalizing these concepts within the arm's length framework—if a multinational manufactures products in a developing country benefiting from low labor costs, should the local manufacturer retain some portion of resulting cost savings, or should arm's length pricing pass those savings to the parent company just as an independent contract manufacturer would? The OECD position generally supports the latter interpretation, while developing countries counter that this interpretation ignores bargaining dynamics between independent parties who might negotiate to retain a portion of savings or value creation. These tensions manifest in disputes over transfer pricing adjustments and corresponding adjustments, with developing countries making Article 9(1) primary adjustments reflecting their view of appropriate value allocation while developed countries resist Article 9(2) corresponding adjustments on grounds that the primary adjustments are not "justified both in principle and as regards the amount," resulting in double taxation that mutual agreement procedures struggle to resolve.

### 7. Critical Evaluation of Article 9 Effectiveness

#### 7.1. Strengths: Legal Certainty and International Consensus

Article 9's enduring strength lies in the legal certainty it provides through international consensus on the separate entity principle. With more than 3,000 bilateral tax treaties globally based on the OECD or UN Model Tax Conventions, and 117 Inclusive Framework jurisdictions having incorporated the arm's length principle in their domestic legislation, multinational enterprises can structure operations with confidence that transfer pricing will be evaluated under consistent conceptual principles, facilitating international investment and integration of global value chains. The separate entity approach also respects the legal structure of multinational enterprises by acknowledging that subsidiaries are distinct legal entities subject to local law, providing a principled foundation for taxation and avoiding the conceptual difficulties of determining which entities belong to the unitary business or how to treat partially-owned affiliates and joint ventures. The corresponding adjustment mechanism in Article 9(2), despite limitations, provides an important safeguard against double taxation when tax administrations engage constructively in mutual agreement procedures, with the recent expansion of mandatory arbitration provisions in many bilateral treaties addressing historical weaknesses in MAP by ensuring timely resolution when competent authorities cannot reach agreement.

#### 7.2. Weaknesses: Comparability Challenges and Digital Economy

The fundamental weakness of Article 9 lies in the practical difficulty of applying the arm's length principle to transactions that are, by their nature, not arm's length. Multinational enterprises create value through integration and synergy—economies of scale, knowledge sharing, risk diversification, and strategic coordination that independent enterprises cannot replicate—requiring the finding of comparable transactions that often do not exist, particularly for unique intangible assets or complex financing arrangements. The comparability problem becomes acute in the digital economy, where business models frequently involve no physical presence in market jurisdictions, centralized intangible asset ownership, and data-driven value creation. Traditional transfer pricing methods struggle to allocate profits appropriately when user-generated content, network effects, or data collection in one jurisdiction creates value captured by legal entities in other jurisdictions. The complexity and subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing analysis create opportunities for both aggressive tax planning and inconsistent tax administration.

#### 7.3. The Future of Article 9 in Light of Pillar One

The OECD's Pillar One represents the most significant challenge to Article 9's dominance in international profit allocation since the arm's length principle's adoption. Pillar One's Amount A mechanism partially abandons the separate entity approach by allocating 25% of residual profits exceeding a 10% margin to market jurisdictions based on revenue, regardless of physical presence or functions performed locally, directly contradicting Article 9's premise that profits should be allocated based on what independent enterprises would agree (examined in June 2023). The Multilateral Convention implementing Pillar One will provide that Amount A constitutes an exclusion from the provisions of Article 7 and Article 9, preserving Article 9 for non-Amount A profits while creating a parallel system for covered residual profits. Whether this dualistic approach proves sustainable or represents a transitional step toward broader formulary allocation remains uncertain. If Pillar One succeeds in implementation, it may validate the view that Article 9's arm's length approach cannot adequately address profit allocation in highly digitalized, intangibles-intensive business models, with the willingness of the international community to accept partial formulary allocation suggesting erosion of the consensus supporting pure separate entity treatment. Conversely, if Pillar One encounters implementation difficulties or fails to achieve widespread adoption, it may reinforce Article 9's position as the only practically viable framework for international profit allocation despite its acknowledged limitations.
