## Chapter 8: State Practice with Respect to Restrictions on Interest Deductibility

Restrictions on interest deductibility represent one of the most significant developments in international tax policy over the past two decades. These rules address the fundamental asymmetry in corporate taxation whereby interest payments are deductible while equity returns are not, creating incentives for multinational enterprises to finance operations with debt—particularly in high-tax jurisdictions—to reduce taxable profits through excessive interest deductions.

### 1. Introduction and Policy Rationale

#### 1.1. The Debt Bias in Corporate Taxation

Traditional corporate income tax systems create a structural preference for debt over equity finance by allowing tax deductions for interest payments but not for equity costs. This debt bias has significant implications for corporate capital structures and international tax planning. Interest deductions reduce taxable income in proportion to applicable tax rates, making deductions most valuable in high-tax jurisdictions. Multinational enterprises can exploit this asymmetry by concentrating debt in high-tax countries while holding equity in lower-tax jurisdictions.

The distinction between debt and equity is central to these concerns. Debt creates a legal obligation to repay principal and pay interest, with lenders holding priority claims. Equity represents ownership interest, with dividends paid from after-tax profits and shareholders absorbing residual risk. Because interest is deductible while dividends are not, the after-tax cost of debt is systematically lower than the cost of equity, encouraging leveraged capital structures that may not reflect commercial reality.

#### 1.2. Base Erosion Through Interest Deductions

A key profit-shifting technique involves subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions lending to affiliates in high-tax jurisdictions, allowing interest deductions in the high-tax country while avoiding taxation in the low-tax country. This earnings stripping reduces taxable profits in high-tax jurisdictions by substituting deductible interest payments for non-deductible equity returns.

The revenue implications are substantial. Estimates suggest that developing countries lose between four and ten percent of global corporate income tax revenue annually to base erosion and profit shifting, with excessive interest deductions constituting a significant component of these losses. Developed countries face similar challenges, with domestic tax bases eroded through intercompany financing arrangements that lack commercial substance beyond tax advantages.

Back-to-back loan structures exemplify these concerns. In such arrangements, a parent company borrows from an external bank and on-lends to subsidiaries, potentially at different interest rates or on modified terms. If the parent claims a deduction for interest paid to the bank while the subsidiary pays little or no interest to the parent, the group achieves a deduction without corresponding income inclusion. These structures combine the benefits of external debt with the flexibility of intercompany arrangements, creating opportunities for base erosion that interest limitation rules specifically target.

### 2. Thin Capitalisation Rules

#### 2.1. Debt-to-Equity Ratio Approaches

Traditional thin capitalisation rules restrict interest deductibility by defining maximum debt-to-equity ratios. If a company's debt exceeds the prescribed ratio, interest on the excess debt becomes non-deductible. These safe harbour rules provide predictability for taxpayers and simplicity for tax administrations.

Prescribed threshold ratios vary across jurisdictions. Countries including Brazil, Canada, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Switzerland have historically applied debt-to-equity ratios ranging from 1.5:1 to 4:1. Under a 3:1 ratio, for example, a company with equity of 10 could maintain deductible debt of up to 30; any additional debt would generate non-deductible interest.

The advantages of ratio-based approaches include administrative simplicity and clear compliance benchmarks. However, these rules can disadvantage legitimately leveraged groups whose business models require high debt levels for non-tax reasons—such as capital-intensive industries or regulated financial services. Fixed ratios also fail to account for variations in appropriate leverage across different sectors and business circumstances.

#### 2.2. Arm's Length Approaches

Alternative approaches apply transfer pricing principles to intercompany financing, focusing on whether interest rates and loan terms reflect what independent parties would agree. This arm's length methodology examines the creditworthiness of the borrower, comparable market transactions, and the commercial terms of financing arrangements.

The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines now include comprehensive guidance on financial transactions in Chapter X, added in 2022. This guidance addresses not merely whether the interest rate is arm's length but whether the loan itself—including its amount and terms—reflects what independent parties would agree. Relevant factors include whether the borrower could service the debt, whether the financing serves a genuine business purpose, and whether the lender would have extended credit on similar terms to an unrelated party with comparable creditworthiness.

Arm's length approaches offer flexibility by examining specific facts and circumstances rather than applying mechanical ratios. However, they impose significant compliance burdens and create uncertainty regarding acceptable leverage levels. Tax administrations require substantial resources to evaluate the appropriateness of intercompany financing arrangements, particularly for complex multinational structures.

#### 2.3. Hybrid Instruments and Classification Challenges

International differences in how countries classify financial instruments create arbitrage opportunities. Hybrid instruments may be treated as debt in one country but equity in another, allowing payments to be deductible interest in the payer's jurisdiction while receiving favourable dividend treatment in the recipient's jurisdiction.

These mismatches generate deduction/no inclusion outcomes where the payer claims a deduction for interest while the recipient either excludes the payment from income or treats it as a tax-exempt dividend. BEPS Action 2 addressed hybrid mismatches by recommending that countries deny deductions for payments that are not included in the recipient's income or for which another party obtains a corresponding deduction.

The United States implemented hybrid mismatch rules through Section 267A of the Internal Revenue Code, which denies deductions for interest and royalty payments that produce deduction/no inclusion outcomes. The provision treats interest-free related-party loans as hybrid transactions where the borrower claims imputed interest deductions while the lender has no corresponding income inclusion. These targeted rules complement broader interest limitation provisions by addressing specific structures designed to exploit classification differences across jurisdictions.

### 3. Earnings Stripping Rules

#### 3.1. Fixed Ratio Rules (EBITDA-Based)

The global trend has shifted decisively from debt-to-equity ratio rules toward earnings stripping rules that limit interest deductions based on a percentage of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. BEPS Action 4 recommended limiting net interest expense to between 10 and 30 percent of EBITDA, with most jurisdictions adopting 30 percent as the standard threshold.

Under a 30 percent EBITDA limit, an entity with EBITDA of 10 million could deduct net interest expense up to 3 million. Interest exceeding this threshold would be disallowed in the current period, though most jurisdictions permit carryforward of disallowed amounts. The earnings-based approach links deductibility to the entity's capacity to service debt, providing a more economically meaningful limitation than fixed ratios.

Research indicates that earnings stripping rules reduce total debt-to-assets ratios by an average of 2.8 percentage points when applied automatically, substantially more effective than discretionary application. The shift toward earnings-based rules reflects recognition that these approaches better address base erosion while accommodating legitimate variations in business leverage. *(covered in December 2024)*

#### 3.2. Group Ratio Rules

Where an entity exceeds the fixed ratio because its multinational group is legitimately highly leveraged for non-tax reasons, group ratio rules provide an alternative. Under this approach, an entity may deduct interest up to the higher of the fixed ratio or the group's net third-party interest expense as a percentage of group EBITDA.

The group ratio equals the consolidated group's net interest expense on third-party debt divided by consolidated group EBITDA. If the group ratio exceeds the fixed ratio—indicating that the group's overall leverage reflects commercial rather than tax-driven considerations—entities within the group may use the higher ratio for deductibility purposes.

This mechanism protects genuinely leveraged groups from adverse consequences while maintaining restrictions on artificial intragroup financing designed to shift profits. The policy rationale recognises that some industries—such as infrastructure, utilities, and real estate—legitimately operate with higher leverage reflecting their stable cash flows and asset-backed financing rather than tax-motivated structuring. The requirement that the group ratio calculation includes only third-party debt prevents manipulation through intercompany arrangements.

#### 3.3. De Minimis Thresholds

Most jurisdictions include de minimis thresholds that exempt entities with low net interest expense from compliance burdens. The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive establishes EUR 3 million as the standard safe harbour, with entities whose exceeding borrowing costs fall below this threshold able to deduct all interest regardless of the EBITDA ratio.

De minimis thresholds recognise that low-debt entities pose minimal base erosion risk and that compliance costs would be disproportionate to any revenue protection achieved. Approximately 59 percent of EU member states have implemented the EUR 3 million threshold, though some jurisdictions have adopted lower amounts. The United Kingdom applies a GBP 2 million threshold for its Corporate Interest Restriction.

### 4. Country Examples

#### 4.1. European Approaches

Germany introduced its interest barrier rule in 2008, limiting net interest expense deductibility to 30 percent of adjusted EBITDA. The German rules include three main exemptions: a EUR 3 million de minimis threshold, an exemption for standalone entities not part of a group, and a group escape where the entity's debt-to-equity ratio is no worse than two percentage points below the group's ratio. Disallowed interest carries forward indefinitely but may be forfeited on change of control or reorganisation.

Germany significantly strengthened its rules in 2024 through the Growth Opportunities Act, introducing transfer pricing requirements for intercompany financing. New provisions require that borrowers demonstrate capacity to service debt throughout the loan term and that borrowed funds serve genuine business purposes. Interest rates must not exceed what the borrower could obtain based on its standalone or group credit rating. These changes apply to cross-border related-party financing and substantially expand compliance obligations.

The United Kingdom implemented its Corporate Interest Restriction in 2017, restricting tax relief on net interest and financing costs exceeding GBP 2 million annually. The default fixed ratio of 30 percent of tax-EBITDA applies, with a group ratio alternative available for legitimately leveraged groups. Disallowed interest carries forward indefinitely, while unused allowance carries forward for up to five years. The regime affected approximately 6,800 companies as of March 2023, with this number likely increasing as interest rates rose.

#### 4.2. United States Section 163(j)

The United States reformed its interest limitation rules through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective 2018. Section 163(j) limits deductible business interest to the sum of business interest income plus 30 percent of adjusted taxable income plus floor plan financing interest.

The calculation of adjusted taxable income has changed over time. From 2018 to 2021, adjusted taxable income was calculated without adjustments for depreciation and amortisation. From 2022 through 2024, the calculation used earnings before interest and taxes, significantly narrowing the base and reducing permissible deductions. Beginning in 2025, legislation restored the EBITDA calculation, adding back depreciation, amortisation, and depletion deductions to increase adjusted taxable income and permit higher interest deductions.

A small business exemption applies to entities with average annual gross receipts not exceeding 31 million dollars, covering approximately 98 percent of US businesses. Certain trades are also exempt, including real property businesses and farming operations that elect into alternative depreciation, though this election requires longer depreciation periods that may offset benefits.

#### 4.3. Other Jurisdictions

Australia overhauled its thin capitalisation regime in 2024, with new rules generally effective from July 2023. The revised framework offers three alternative tests: a fixed ratio test at 30 percent of EBITDA, a group ratio test, and a third-party debt test. New debt deduction creation rules effective July 2024 disallow deductions for amounts incurred in schemes lacking genuine commercial justification. The Australian Tax Office has taken a restrictive approach to the third-party debt test, requiring additional arm's length analysis for cross-border related-party borrowing.

Canada implemented its Excessive Interest and Financing Expenses Limitation rules as its BEPS Action 4 response, limiting deductions to 30 percent of tax EBITDA. Excess interest becomes restricted financing expenses that may carry forward indefinitely or be absorbed by group members.

### 5. EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive

#### 5.1. Article 4 Interest Limitation

The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive established minimum standards for interest limitation across EU member states, with Article 4 limiting the deductibility of exceeding borrowing costs to 30 percent of EBITDA. The Directive required implementation by January 2019, though jurisdictions with equally effective rules in place received extensions until January 2024.

The Directive defines exceeding borrowing costs as net interest expense including amounts economically equivalent to interest. Member states must apply the 30 percent ratio as the minimum standard but may adopt stricter limitations. The EUR 3 million de minimis threshold applies unless member states choose lower amounts or no threshold.

#### 5.2. Member State Implementation

Member state implementation varies within the Directive's parameters. Most jurisdictions adopted the 30 percent EBITDA ratio and EUR 3 million threshold, though some applied stricter rules. Finland and Norway adopted 25 percent ratios, while the Netherlands and Spain use EUR 1 million de minimis thresholds. Italy applies no de minimis threshold.

Member states retain discretion regarding standalone entity exemptions, financial institution treatment, and grandfathering of pre-existing loans. This flexibility has resulted in fragmented implementation that complicates compliance for multinational groups operating across multiple EU jurisdictions. Financial institutions pose particular challenges because standard EBITDA-based rules are poorly suited to banking and insurance operations, where entities are typically net lenders with positive net interest income and where regulatory capital requirements drive leverage decisions rather than tax planning.

Grandfathering provisions permit pre-existing loans to be excluded from interest limitation rules provided their essential terms remain unchanged. This transition mechanism facilitated implementation of ATAD requirements but creates ongoing complexity in determining whether loan modifications trigger loss of grandfathered status. Jurisdictions have adopted varying approaches to defining material modifications, creating further fragmentation across the single market.

Recent proposals from tax advisers' organisations have called for simplification, recognising that the rules were designed in a different economic context. Rising interest rates and higher capital costs have increased the number of businesses affected by interest limitations, prompting discussion of upward adjustment to de minimis thresholds and mandatory harmonisation of carryforward provisions.

### 6. Practical Implementation Issues

#### 6.1. Carryforward Provisions

Most jurisdictions permit indefinite carryforward of disallowed interest expense, allowing deductions in future years when entities have sufficient interest allowance. Germany, Australia, and Canada provide unlimited carryforward, while the United Kingdom permits indefinite carryforward of disallowed interest but limits unused allowance carryforward to five years.

Carryforward mechanics vary in treatment of ownership changes and reorganisations. Some jurisdictions forfeit carried-forward amounts on change of control, while others permit continued utilisation subject to anti-avoidance provisions. The treatment of carryforwards in group contexts—including whether excess capacity in one entity can offset excess interest in another—also differs across jurisdictions.

The United States permits indefinite carryforward of disallowed business interest expense, with carryforwards deducted in order of the year incurred. Current year interest is deducted before carryforwards, and the earliest carryforwards are used first. Germany similarly provides unlimited carryforward but also permits carryforward of unused EBITDA capacity in certain circumstances, providing additional flexibility for groups with volatile earnings. These variations in carryforward treatment can significantly affect the present value of interest deductions and influence financing decisions for multinational enterprises operating across multiple jurisdictions.

#### 6.2. Interaction with Transfer Pricing

Interest limitation rules operate alongside transfer pricing requirements for intercompany financing. Transfer pricing analysis examines whether interest rates and loan terms are arm's length, while interest limitation rules cap total deductible interest regardless of pricing. Both sets of rules may restrict the same interest payment, with transfer pricing disallowing the portion exceeding arm's length rates and interest limitation rules disallowing amounts exceeding the EBITDA threshold.

Recent developments have strengthened the connection between these regimes. Germany's 2024 changes require transfer pricing analysis of debt capacity and business purpose as prerequisites for interest deductibility. The OECD's Chapter X guidance on financial transactions establishes that the loan quantum—not merely the interest rate—must be arm's length, potentially restricting deductions before interest limitation rules apply. *(covered in December 2025)*

#### 6.3. Treaty Considerations

Tax treaties typically preserve domestic authority to limit interest deductions, though interactions with treaty provisions require careful analysis. Most treaties allow source countries to apply transfer pricing adjustments to excessive interest, with the normal interest amount alone receiving treaty treatment.

Where interest limitation rules cause economic double taxation—with deductions denied in one country while the corresponding income remains taxable in another—mutual agreement procedures may provide relief. However, the interaction between domestic interest limitation rules and treaty withholding provisions is not fully harmonised globally, creating ongoing compliance and dispute resolution challenges for multinational enterprises. The absence of uniform approaches to these issues across treaty networks means that financing structures must be evaluated on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, considering both domestic interest limitation rules and applicable treaty provisions.
