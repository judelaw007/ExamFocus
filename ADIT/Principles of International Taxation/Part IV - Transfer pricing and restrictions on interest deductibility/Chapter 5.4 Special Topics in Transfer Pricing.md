## Chapter 5.4: Special Topics in Transfer Pricing

### 1. Hard-to-Value Intangibles

The transfer of intangible property between associated enterprises presents distinctive challenges where the intangible's value depends on uncertain future outcomes and reliable comparable transactions do not exist. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines address these challenges through specific guidance on hard-to-value intangibles, providing a framework for tax administrations to evaluate whether pricing at the time of transfer appropriately reflected the intangible's subsequent performance.

#### 1.1. Definition and Characteristics

Paragraph 6.189 of the Guidelines defines hard-to-value intangibles as intangibles or rights in intangibles for which, at the time of transfer, no reliable comparables exist and the projections of future cash flows or income expected to be derived from the intangible, or the assumptions used in valuing the intangible, are highly uncertain. This uncertainty makes predicting the intangible's ultimate success difficult at the time when the transfer pricing arrangement must be established.

Several circumstances commonly give rise to hard-to-value intangible transactions. Intangibles that are only partially developed at the time of transfer typically qualify, as their ultimate commercial value remains speculative. Intangibles not expected to be exploited commercially until several years following the transaction present similar valuation challenges, as market conditions and competitive dynamics may shift substantially before commercial returns materialize. Intangibles that are integral to the development or enhancement of other intangibles that themselves fall within the hard-to-value definition compound valuation uncertainty through their interdependence.

#### 1.2. The Ex-Post Approach

The distinctive feature of the hard-to-value intangibles framework is the ex-post approach, which permits tax administrations to use actual outcomes as presumptive evidence regarding the appropriateness of the original pricing arrangement. Under this approach, where the actual financial outcomes of an intangible transfer diverge significantly from the projections used in establishing the transfer price, tax administrations may treat this divergence as evidence that the ex-ante pricing arrangement did not appropriately reflect the intangible's arm's length value.

This approach addresses the fundamental information asymmetry between taxpayers and tax administrations in intangible valuations. At the time of transfer, the transferring enterprise typically possesses superior information regarding the intangible's development status, commercial prospects, and risk profile. The ex-post approach provides a mechanism for tax administrations to challenge pricing arrangements where subsequent events reveal that projections were unrealistic or that material information was not appropriately reflected in the valuation.

Taxpayers retain the right to rebut this presumption by demonstrating the reliability of information supporting the pricing methodology at the time of the transaction. Contemporaneous documentation establishing the reasonableness of projections and assumptions becomes critical in defending against ex-post adjustments. The Guidelines recognize that not all divergence between projected and actual outcomes indicates inappropriate pricing; commercial uncertainty is inherent in intangible development, and arm's length parties regularly experience outcomes differing from expectations.

Importantly, paragraph 6.193 provides that the hard-to-value intangibles approach does not apply where the transfer is covered by a bilateral or multilateral advance pricing arrangement. This exemption recognizes that the cooperative process underlying advance pricing arrangements provides tax administrations with contemporaneous access to information that addresses the information asymmetry concerns motivating the ex-post approach.

### 2. Low Value-Adding Intra-Group Services

Multinational enterprises commonly provide supportive services across their group members, including administrative, accounting, legal, and information technology functions. Recognizing that full transfer pricing analysis for such routine services may impose disproportionate compliance burdens relative to the revenues and risks involved, the Guidelines establish a simplified approach for low value-adding intra-group services.

#### 2.1. Qualifying Criteria

Services qualify for the simplified approach only where they meet all specified characteristics. The services must be of a supportive nature, meaning they do not constitute the core business activities of the multinational group. Services forming part of the group's principal profit-generating activities or contributing to economically significant activities do not qualify regardless of their routine character from the provider's perspective.

Qualifying services must not require the use of, or result in the creation of, unique and valuable intangibles. Services involving significant intellectual property development, enhancement, or exploitation fall outside the simplified regime regardless of their supportive role. Similarly, services must not involve the assumption or control of substantial or economically significant risks, and the service provider must not create significant risk for itself through the arrangement.

The Guidelines provide illustrative examples of services typically qualifying for simplified treatment. Accounting and auditing services, including preparation and review of financial statements and accounts, commonly qualify. Human resources activities including general recruitment, training administration, and employee relations support represent typical qualifying services. Information technology services involving system maintenance, general technical support, and help desk functions may qualify where information technology does not constitute the group's principal activity. Legal services of a general nature, including contract review and routine legal consultations, similarly fall within scope.

Certain categories of services are expressly excluded from the simplified approach regardless of their supportive character. Research and development activities, manufacturing and production services, purchasing of raw materials for manufacturing, sales and marketing activities, financial transactions, extraction and processing of natural resources, insurance and reinsurance services, and services of corporate senior management do not qualify for simplified treatment. These exclusions reflect either the inherently value-creating nature of such activities or their potential to involve unique intangibles and significant risks.

#### 2.2. The Simplified Approach and 5% Markup

The simplified approach for low value-adding services follows a structured process. First, the service provider determines cost pools for each category of qualifying services, aggregating direct and indirect costs attributable to service provision. Second, costs relating to services performed solely for one specific group member are identified and removed from the general pool for direct charging. Third, remaining costs benefiting multiple group members are allocated using appropriate allocation keys reflecting relative benefits received. Fourth, a markup of five percent is applied to all costs in the pool, excluding pass-through costs charged without markup.

Paragraph 7.61 establishes the five percent markup as the standard for all low value-adding services regardless of service category. This uniform markup reflects the supportive nature of qualifying services and the limited value contribution they represent. The simplified approach eliminates the requirement for benchmarking studies that would otherwise be necessary to establish arm's length service fees, substantially reducing compliance burden for routine supportive services.

The five percent markup applies consistently across service categories because the qualifying criteria ensure that services falling within the regime share the characteristic of limited value contribution. Services that might warrant higher returns due to specialized expertise, valuable intangibles, or significant risks are excluded by the qualifying criteria rather than accommodated through variable markups.

Where the simplified approach is adopted, it should be applied consistently on a group-wide basis to the extent practicable. Selective application to services in particular jurisdictions while applying full transfer pricing analysis elsewhere raises concerns regarding manipulation of the regime and may invite challenge from tax administrations.

### 3. Cost Contribution Arrangements

Cost contribution arrangements provide a framework for associated enterprises to share the costs and risks of jointly developing, producing, or obtaining assets, services, or rights expected to benefit each participant's business operations. Unlike intra-group service arrangements where one party provides services to another for compensation, cost contribution arrangements involve participants contributing to a joint activity in proportion to their expected benefits.

#### 3.1. Structure and Types

A cost contribution arrangement is a contractual arrangement among business enterprises to share contributions and risks in the joint development, production, or obtaining of intangibles, tangible assets, or services, with each participant's interest in the results determined by the arrangement. Chapter VIII of the Guidelines addresses cost contribution arrangements comprehensively, distinguishing between development arrangements and services arrangements based on the nature of expected benefits.

Development cost contribution arrangements involve joint development, production, or obtaining of intangibles or tangible assets expected to create ongoing future benefits for participants. Such arrangements often involve significant risks with uncertain outcomes and distant benefit realization, requiring sophisticated valuation approaches. The development of pharmaceutical compounds, technology platforms, or manufacturing processes through joint investment represents typical development cost contribution arrangement activity.

Services cost contribution arrangements involve obtaining services that create current benefits rather than future asset development. Benefits from services arrangements are more certain and materialize more immediately than development arrangement benefits, reducing valuation complexity. Joint procurement of administrative services, shared facilities management, or collective training programs represent typical services cost contribution arrangement activities.

For an arrangement to qualify as a cost contribution arrangement under the arm's length principle, each participant must reasonably expect to derive benefit from the activity. Participants contribute to the arrangement based on their reasonably anticipated shares of benefits, with all contributions identified and valued at the time they are made. Contributions may take the form of cash, tangible assets, intangible property, or services.

#### 3.2. Balancing Payments

Where participants' respective contributions are not proportionate to their respective shares of expected benefits, balancing payments are required to rectify the imbalance. Paragraphs 8.34-8.38 address the circumstances requiring balancing payments and the mechanism for determining appropriate amounts.

A participant whose contributions exceed the value proportionate to its expected benefit share should receive compensation from participants whose contributions fall short of their proportionate share. This balancing mechanism ensures that each participant ultimately bears costs consistent with its expected benefits, maintaining arm's length conditions despite potentially uneven contribution patterns.

Buy-in payments arise when a new participant enters an existing cost contribution arrangement involving previously developed intangibles or tangible assets. The entering participant's payment compensates existing participants for access to the results of prior development activity. Similarly, buy-out payments arise when a participant withdraws from an arrangement, with remaining participants compensating the withdrawing party for its interest in the results.

A fundamental distinction separates cost contribution arrangements from intra-group service transactions: cost contribution arrangements do not include profit markups on contributed costs. Participants share actual costs proportionate to expected benefits rather than purchasing services at arm's length prices including provider profit margins. This distinction reflects the mutual, proportionate nature of cost contribution participation versus the provider-recipient relationship characterizing service transactions.

### 4. Safe Harbours

Safe harbour provisions relieve eligible taxpayers from certain obligations otherwise imposed by general transfer pricing rules, providing simplified compliance mechanisms for defined categories of taxpayers or transactions. The Guidelines, following revision in 2013, recognize that properly designed safe harbours can reduce compliance burdens while maintaining consistency with arm's length principles.

The evolution of the OECD's position on safe harbours reflects changing views regarding the balance between theoretical purity and practical administrability. Earlier guidance expressed skepticism regarding safe harbours, emphasizing concerns that simplified approaches might facilitate non-arm's length pricing. The 2013 revision adopted a more favourable tone, recognizing that administrative efficiency and taxpayer certainty represent legitimate policy objectives that appropriately designed safe harbours can advance without sacrificing arm's length integrity.

Two principal categories of safe harbours exist in transfer pricing contexts. Simplified documentation safe harbours reduce or eliminate transfer pricing documentation requirements for small companies or transactions below specified thresholds. Such provisions recognize that the compliance burden of full documentation may be disproportionate to the tax risk presented by small-scale related party transactions. Prescribed pricing safe harbours establish predetermined margins, markups, or pricing approaches that tax administrations will accept without further analysis. The low value-adding services simplified approach with its five percent markup represents the most widely applied prescribed pricing safe harbour.

Safe harbours provide significant benefits for both taxpayers and tax administrations. Taxpayers gain reduced compliance costs, greater certainty regarding acceptable pricing, and simplified approaches for determining arm's length conditions. Tax administrations benefit from efficient resource allocation, focusing examination efforts on higher-risk transactions while processing routine transactions through simplified mechanisms. These mutual benefits explain the growing acceptance of safe harbours despite their departure from case-by-case arm's length analysis.

The Guidelines encourage bilateral and multilateral safe harbours agreed between competent authorities rather than unilateral provisions. Bilateral arrangements address concerns that unilateral safe harbours may facilitate double taxation or double non-taxation, as treaty partners may not accept the simplified pricing as arm's length for their purposes. Advance pricing arrangements represent the most developed form of bilateral safe harbour, providing prospective certainty for specific transactions and taxpayers.

### 5. Transfer Pricing Documentation

#### 5.1. The Three-Tier Structure

The BEPS Action 13 report established a standardized three-tier documentation structure designed to enhance transparency regarding multinational group operations and transfer pricing practices. Chapter V of the Guidelines incorporates this structure, requiring qualifying multinational groups to maintain master files, local files, and country-by-country reports.

The master file provides tax administrations with a high-level overview of the multinational group's global operations, including organizational structure, description of business activities, intangibles owned and their development, intercompany financial activities, and financial and tax positions. The master file addresses how the group operates across jurisdictions, how transfer pricing policies align with business strategy, and how value is created within the group. All relevant tax administrations receive access to the master file, which establishes the global context for evaluating individual entity transactions.

The local file provides transaction-level detail specific to each jurisdiction, containing detailed documentation demonstrating that material related party transactions comply with the arm's length principle. Local file content includes specific information on material controlled transactions, comparability analysis, and selection and application of transfer pricing methods. Local files are maintained and filed according to each jurisdiction's domestic requirements.

#### 5.2. Country-by-Country Reporting

Country-by-country reports provide a global snapshot of multinational group operations disaggregated by tax jurisdiction. Report content includes revenue, profit or loss before income tax, income tax paid and accrued, stated capital, accumulated earnings, number of employees, and tangible assets for each jurisdiction where the group operates. This information enables tax administrations to identify potential profit-shifting risks by comparing profit allocations with indicators of economic activity location.

The country-by-country reporting threshold applies to multinational groups with consolidated annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more. This threshold excludes approximately eighty-five to ninety percent of multinational groups while capturing approximately ninety percent of corporate revenues globally. Over 120 jurisdictions have implemented country-by-country reporting requirements, with more than 4,450 exchange relationships facilitating cross-border information sharing between tax administrations.

The three-tier structure represents a fundamental shift in transfer pricing transparency, providing tax administrations with standardized information previously unavailable or difficult to obtain. Prior to BEPS Action 13, documentation requirements varied substantially across jurisdictions, with some requiring minimal disclosure while others demanded extensive analysis. The standardized approach facilitates risk assessment and cross-border cooperation while reducing the compliance complexity of maintaining different documentation for different jurisdictions.

Failure to comply with documentation requirements may result in significant consequences. Monetary penalties for late or incomplete filings, interest on underpaid taxes identified through documentation-based audits, and increased scrutiny triggering comprehensive transfer pricing examinations represent direct compliance risks. Additionally, jurisdictions with public disclosure requirements may expose non-compliant groups to reputational consequences beyond immediate tax liability.

### 6. Amount B: Simplified Approach for Baseline Distribution

In February 2024, the OECD published final guidance on Amount B as part of the Pillar One framework, subsequently incorporated as an Annex to Chapter IV of the Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Amount B provides a simplified and streamlined approach to transfer pricing for baseline marketing and distribution activities, responding to concerns that full arm's length analysis for routine distribution functions imposes disproportionate burdens while generating disputes consuming substantial enforcement resources.

Amount B applies to qualifying wholesale distributors, sales agents, and commissionaires performing baseline marketing and distribution activities. Baseline activities involve routine distribution functions without ownership of unique and valuable intangibles or assumption of economically significant risks beyond those inherent in standard distribution operations. The simplified approach provides predetermined pricing outcomes for qualifying transactions, eliminating the need for case-by-case benchmarking analysis.

Jurisdictions may choose to implement Amount B on an elective basis, permitting qualifying taxpayers to apply the simplified approach, or on a mandatory basis, requiring the simplified approach for in-scope transactions. Implementation is available for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with jurisdictions progressively adopting the framework based on domestic legislative processes.

A critical limitation affects Amount B application across jurisdictions. The simplified approach provides an arm's length outcome only in jurisdictions that choose to apply it. In jurisdictions not implementing Amount B, the prescribed pricing will not be treated as satisfying Article 9 requirements or as eligible for dispute resolution under Article 25 mutual agreement procedures. This jurisdictional variation requires careful planning by multinational groups operating across implementing and non-implementing jurisdictions.
