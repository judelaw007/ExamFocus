## Chapter 7: The UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries 2021

The United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries provides specialised guidance addressing the unique challenges developing countries face in administering transfer pricing rules. While sharing foundational principles with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, the UN Manual offers pragmatic adaptations recognising capacity constraints, data limitations, and the particular importance of protecting source country tax bases in developing economies.

### 1. Introduction and Context

#### 1.1. Evolution of the UN Manual

The UN has published three editions of its Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries. The first edition appeared in 2013, introducing foundational guidance on transfer pricing analysis and administration specifically designed for developing countries. The second edition in 2017 updated the Manual to reflect outputs from the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project and incorporated feedback from developing country practitioners. The third and current edition, published in 2021, represents the most comprehensive guidance to date, drawing on experience from both previous editions and reflecting developments in transfer pricing practice since 2017.

The 2021 Manual is organised into four main parts. Part A establishes the contextual framework for transfer pricing in a global environment. Part B addresses design principles and policy considerations, including detailed guidance on the arm's length principle and transfer pricing methodologies. Part C provides practical guidance on transfer pricing legislation design and implementation. Part D presents country practices from Brazil, China, India, Kenya, Mexico, and South Africa, offering developing countries concrete examples of how peer jurisdictions have approached transfer pricing administration.

#### 1.2. Relationship with OECD Guidelines

The UN Manual and OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines share the arm's length principle as their cornerstone and recognise the same five transfer pricing methods. Both frameworks address intangibles, intra-group services, and financial transactions, and both aim to prevent double taxation and profit shifting. However, the UN Manual differs fundamentally in its primary focus on developing country capacity and constraints, whereas the OECD Guidelines assume the perspective of tax administrations with significant resources and access to comprehensive comparable data.

The relationship between the two frameworks is complementary rather than contradictory. Developing countries may implement transfer pricing regimes drawing on both sources, using the OECD Guidelines as the primary technical reference while adapting approaches based on UN Manual guidance where resource constraints or data limitations make strict OECD compliance impractical. *(covered in December 2023)*

### 2. Developing Country Challenges

#### 2.1. Capacity and Resource Constraints

Transfer pricing administrative capacities are notably weak across developing countries. Most developing country tax administrations lack specialised transfer pricing audit units and instead rely on general tax auditors who may have limited understanding of transfer pricing concepts. The technical complexity of transfer pricing analysis—requiring functional analysis, comparability assessment, and economic evaluation—demands expertise that many developing countries struggle to develop and retain.

The revenue implications of these capacity constraints are substantial. Estimates suggest that developing countries lose between four and ten percent of global corporate income tax revenue annually to base erosion and profit shifting, translating to losses of approximately 100 to 240 billion USD. Developing countries are disproportionately affected because of their higher reliance on corporate income tax relative to other revenue sources. Effective transfer pricing administration is therefore essential for protecting tax bases and mobilising domestic resources for sustainable development investments.

The asymmetry between multinational enterprises and developing country tax authorities compounds these challenges. Multinational groups access global resources including sophisticated transfer pricing advisors, comprehensive databases, and coordinated planning across jurisdictions. Developing country tax administrations must address these complex arrangements with limited budgets, fewer trained personnel, and often inadequate information systems. This imbalance shapes the UN Manual's emphasis on pragmatic approaches that acknowledge administrative reality rather than assuming ideal conditions.

#### 2.2. Comparability Data Limitations

Finding reliable comparable transactions represents one of the most significant challenges for developing country transfer pricing administration. Surveys indicate that approximately 76 percent of developing countries report absence of suitable comparables for transfer pricing analysis, an increase from 65 percent in earlier assessments. Commercial databases containing comparable company data require expensive licensing fees, typically payable in foreign currency, which many developing country tax administrations cannot afford.

Even where database access exists, comparables from developed country markets may not provide appropriate benchmarks for developing country transactions. Market conditions, risk profiles, and economic circumstances differ substantially between developed and developing economies. The UN Manual accordingly endorses preference for national comparables over foreign alternatives where legislation permits, recognising that imperfect local data may be more relevant than perfect foreign comparables that fail to reflect local market conditions.

#### 2.3. Information Asymmetries

Developing countries frequently lack independent information to verify multinational enterprise claims regarding product quality, pricing, and transaction terms. Testing facilities and equipment for verification—particularly important in extractive industries—may be unavailable. Tax administrations may struggle to access technical expertise needed to evaluate company-reported data, such as mineral grades or product specifications that directly affect pricing.

These information asymmetries favour multinational enterprises in transfer pricing disputes. The enterprise knows the true nature of its transactions, products, and relationships, while the tax administration must attempt verification with limited tools and resources. The UN Manual's guidance on documentation requirements and information gathering reflects awareness of these asymmetries, emphasising the importance of obtaining sufficient information while cautioning against documentation burdens that exceed developing country capacity to evaluate.

### 3. Key Methodological Guidance

#### 3.1. Transfer Pricing Methods

The UN Manual provides guidance on the five transfer pricing methods recognised in the OECD Guidelines. The traditional transaction methods—Comparable Uncontrolled Price, Resale Price Method, and Cost Plus Method—compare controlled transactions directly with uncontrolled transactions or apply appropriate margins to costs or resale prices. The transactional profit methods—Transactional Net Margin Method and Profit Split Method—assess net profit margins or allocate combined profits between related parties.

In practice, the Transactional Net Margin Method has become the default approach in many jurisdictions, as it requires less precise comparability than the CUP method while avoiding the profit allocation complexities of the Profit Split Method. The UN Manual recognises this practical reality while emphasising that method selection should depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. For developing countries with limited access to comparable data, the Manual provides guidance on adapting methodological approaches to work with available information rather than abandoning analysis entirely when perfect comparables are unavailable. *(covered in June 2024)*

#### 3.2. The Sixth Method for Commodities

The UN Manual uniquely endorses a sixth method for commodity transactions that uses quoted commodity prices as comparables for related-party sales. This approach has particular relevance for resource-rich developing countries where commodity exports constitute significant portions of tax revenue and where comparable transaction data for intermediate products—such as mineral concentrates—is scarce.

Approximately thirteen countries have adopted sixth method approaches, including Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Uruguay, Zambia, Malawi, and India. The method recognises that publicly quoted prices for commodities provide realistic market comparables that can substitute for traditional comparability analysis. For developing countries dependent on commodity revenues, the sixth method offers a practical solution to the otherwise intractable problem of pricing related-party commodity sales in the absence of sufficient comparable uncontrolled transactions.

The practical operation of the sixth method typically involves using quoted prices from recognised commodity exchanges or price reporting agencies as the benchmark for related-party transactions. Adjustments may be made for quality differentials, transportation costs, timing differences, and other factors affecting comparability between the specific commodity sold and the quoted benchmark. This approach provides developing country tax administrations with an objective, externally verifiable reference point that reduces reliance on taxpayer-provided data and complex economic analysis.

#### 3.3. Comparability Analysis Adaptations

The UN Manual provides extensive guidance on conducting comparability analysis while acknowledging developing country constraints. The five comparability factors—characteristics of property or services, functional analysis, contractual terms, economic circumstances, and business strategies—apply in developing country contexts, but the Manual recognises that perfect comparability is often unachievable.

The Manual recommends country risk adjustments to prevent under-taxation of developing country entities where comparables from different risk environments are used. If comparables drawn from developed markets are applied to developing country transactions without adjustment, the comparison may systematically understate appropriate returns for developing country entities operating in higher-risk environments. The Manual accordingly endorses adjustments reflecting country-level risk factors that affect expected returns.

### 4. Location Savings and Location-Specific Advantages

#### 4.1. Conceptual Framework

Location savings arise when enterprises benefit from lower costs in particular jurisdictions—including reduced labour costs, cheaper inputs, proximity to markets, or access to natural resources. Location-specific advantages represent broader economic features that provide competitive benefits to enterprises operating in specific locations. These concepts are particularly significant for developing countries where cost advantages often drive foreign investment decisions.

The allocation of location savings between related parties raises important transfer pricing questions. If a multinational establishes manufacturing in a developing country specifically to benefit from lower labour costs, the resulting cost savings represent value created through the location decision. Whether that value should be attributed to the developing country entity performing the manufacturing or the parent company that made the investment decision has direct implications for how profits are allocated across jurisdictions.

#### 4.2. Treatment as Intangibles

The UN Manual's treatment of location savings diverges significantly from the OECD approach. The OECD Guidelines treat market features and location-related factors primarily as comparability considerations—factors to be accounted for when selecting and adjusting comparables rather than as separate sources of value requiring explicit compensation. The UN Manual, by contrast, treats location savings and location-specific advantages as intangibles that may warrant separate recognition and compensation in transfer pricing analysis.

This treatment reflects the UN Manual's concern that developing countries receive appropriate returns for the location-related advantages they offer multinational enterprises. If location savings are treated merely as comparability factors, tax administrations may struggle to ensure appropriate profit allocation to developing country entities. Treating them as intangibles creates a clearer analytical framework for asserting that developing country locations contribute identifiable value deserving compensation. *(covered in June 2025)*

### 5. Specific Transaction Guidance

#### 5.1. Intra-Group Services

The 2021 Manual includes an entirely new chapter on intra-group services, reflecting the significance of service charges in multinational group structures. The guidance covers managerial and administrative services, legal and accounting services, finance and treasury services, training and personnel management, and credit and collection services.

For arm's length compensation, the Manual applies two key tests. The benefit test requires that the service provide a benefit that an independent party would be willing to pay for—services that do not benefit the recipient should not attract charges. This test addresses the concern that parent companies may allocate overhead costs to subsidiaries for activities that provide no genuine benefit to those subsidiaries, effectively extracting profits through management fees for services never requested or received. The charge test requires that fees reflect what independent enterprises would agree to in comparable circumstances. For low value-adding services, the Manual endorses a simplified approach using a standard markup of five percent on costs, with simplified documentation requirements that avoid imposing disproportionate compliance burdens on taxpayers or analytical burdens on tax administrations.

#### 5.2. Intangibles and DEMPE+A

The UN Manual addresses intangibles with particular attention to developing country concerns regarding value allocation. The Manual covers legally protected intangibles such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as market features, group synergies, workforce in place, know-how, customer relationships, and internal procedures.

The UN Manual expands the OECD's DEMPE framework—which attributes intangible returns based on Development, Enhancement, Maintenance, Protection, and Exploitation functions—by explicitly adding Associated Functions to create a DEMPE+A framework. This addition specifically recognises workforce in place as a factor warranting consideration in intangible value allocation. The recognition matters for developing countries where skilled workforces contribute to intangible value creation through manufacturing processes, service delivery, or adaptation of products for local markets.

The distinction between the UN and OECD approaches to intangibles reflects broader differences in perspective regarding value creation. The OECD's DEMPE framework emphasises economic substance over legal ownership, subordinating formal rights to the functions actually performed. The UN Manual, while accepting this substance-over-form principle, gives greater weight to legal ownership as the starting point for analysis and explicitly recognises additional value-creating factors that the OECD framework treats less prominently. For developing country entities performing manufacturing or service functions, the DEMPE+A approach may support stronger claims to intangible-related returns than a strict OECD interpretation would allow.

#### 5.3. Financial Transactions

The 2021 Manual introduces a comprehensive new chapter on financial transactions, addressing intra-group loans, interest rates, guarantees, debt-to-equity considerations, cash pooling arrangements, and captive insurance. This guidance responds to the significant role of intercompany financing in multinational structures and the potential for financial transactions to shift profits away from developing country operations.

The Manual provides practical guidance on applying the arm's length principle to financial transactions, including selection of appropriate transfer pricing methods and documentation requirements. For developing countries with limited financial market development, the guidance acknowledges that determining arm's length interest rates may require adjustments reflecting the specific circumstances of local financial markets rather than simple reference to rates in developed country markets.

#### 5.4. Business Restructurings

The Manual addresses transfer pricing aspects of business restructurings—cross-border redeployments of functions, assets, and risks to which profit or loss potential attaches. Common restructuring types include conversion of full-risk distributors to limited-risk commissionnaires, conversion of full-fledged manufacturers to contract manufacturers or service providers, and transfers of intangible property rights across jurisdictions.

Developing countries face particular concerns regarding business restructurings that may reduce their tax bases. Restructurings transferring valuable functions, assets, or risks out of developing country entities require careful transfer pricing analysis to ensure arm's length compensation. The Manual emphasises that tax administrations should be alert to restructurings that lack commercial rationale beyond tax advantages and should examine whether arrangements transfer inappropriate levels of risk or value without corresponding compensation.

### 6. Implementation and Capacity Building

#### 6.1. Documentation Requirements

The UN Manual recommends transfer pricing documentation while cautioning against requirements that would impose disproportionate burdens on taxpayers or exceed developing country administrative capacity to evaluate. Documentation should be proportionate to transaction complexity and significance. For straightforward transactions or smaller enterprises, simplified requirements may be appropriate.

The Platform for Collaboration on Tax released a Transfer Pricing Documentation Toolkit in 2021 supporting developing country implementation. The toolkit provides sample legislation from over thirty countries, identifies policy choices and legislative options, and offers practical examples and approaches. This resource helps developing countries establish effective documentation frameworks without reinventing approaches already tested elsewhere.

#### 6.2. Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

The Manual addresses mutual agreement procedures, mediation, and arbitration as dispute resolution mechanisms. Mutual agreement procedures offer a relatively simple mechanism but can be slow and provide no guarantee of eliminating double taxation. Mediation can help parties assess the strength of their positions and may contribute to capacity building without requiring legislative changes.

Arbitration presents particular challenges for developing countries. The process imposes significant financial burdens—including costs for arbitrators, translators, and facilitators often payable in foreign currency—on resource-constrained administrations. While pressure grows for mandatory binding dispute resolution, developing countries must carefully consider whether their capacity supports effective participation in arbitration processes. *(covered in June 2023)*

#### 6.3. UN Capacity Development Initiatives

The UN provides capacity development support complementing the Manual. The UN Primer on Transfer Pricing offers a brief introduction for beginners, while the comprehensive UN Course on Transfer Pricing provides detailed training based on the Manual. These resources have supported capacity development in 43 developing countries, with ongoing technical assistance available through the UN Tax Committee and Financing for Sustainable Development Office.

The Platform for Collaboration on Tax—a joint initiative of the International Monetary Fund, OECD, United Nations, and World Bank Group—provides additional toolkits addressing specific developing country challenges. The Comparables Data Toolkit addresses difficulties in accessing comparables data, providing practical strategies for overcoming comparables shortages with particular focus on extractive industry pricing where data limitations are most acute. The Documentation Toolkit supports implementation of proportionate documentation requirements without imposing excessive compliance burdens.

These resources extend the Manual's guidance into practical implementation tools designed for developing country contexts. The collaborative approach recognises that no single international organisation can address all developing country transfer pricing challenges alone. By combining the technical expertise of the OECD, the development focus of the World Bank, the fiscal perspective of the IMF, and the universal membership of the United Nations, the Platform for Collaboration on Tax provides comprehensive support that reflects diverse stakeholder interests and developing country priorities.
