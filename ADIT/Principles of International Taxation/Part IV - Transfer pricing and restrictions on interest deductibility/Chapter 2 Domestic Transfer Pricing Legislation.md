## Chapter 2: Domestic Transfer Pricing Legislation

### 1. Introduction to Domestic Transfer Pricing Frameworks

#### 1.1. The Relationship Between Domestic Law and OECD Guidelines

While the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines provide internationally recognized best practices for applying the arm's length principle, they do not carry the force of law. Transfer pricing rules derive their legal authority from domestic legislation enacted by individual jurisdictions. Each country incorporates transfer pricing requirements into its national tax code, creating a framework that tax authorities can enforce and taxpayers must follow.

The relationship between domestic law and the OECD Guidelines varies significantly across jurisdictions. Some countries explicitly incorporate the Guidelines by legislative reference, making them part of domestic law. Others maintain independent legislative frameworks that align with OECD principles without formal incorporation. Still others adopt approaches that diverge from OECD recommendations in significant respects. Understanding these different approaches is essential for multinational enterprises navigating transfer pricing compliance across multiple jurisdictions.

#### 1.2. Scope of This Comparative Analysis

This chapter examines the domestic transfer pricing legislation of four major economies: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. These jurisdictions were selected because they represent different approaches to incorporating transfer pricing principles into domestic law. The United States maintains the longest-standing transfer pricing regime and has historically influenced OECD thinking while retaining certain distinctive features. The United Kingdom represents an explicit incorporation approach. Germany exemplifies stringent documentation requirements that exceed OECD standards. Australia demonstrates a self-executing legislative framework with risk-based compliance guidance.

For each jurisdiction, this chapter identifies the primary legislative provisions, explains the relationship to OECD Guidelines, describes documentation requirements, and highlights distinctive features that differentiate each regime.

### 2. United States Transfer Pricing Regime

#### 2.1. Legislative Framework: IRC Section 482

The United States transfer pricing regime is codified in Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which grants the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) authority to distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between related organizations if necessary to prevent evasion of taxes or to clearly reflect income. This broad statutory language has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in 1928, predating the OECD's work on transfer pricing by several decades.

The operative details of the US regime appear not in the IRC itself but in the accompanying Treasury Regulations, particularly Treasury Regulation Section 1.482. These regulations, spanning hundreds of pages, provide detailed rules for applying transfer pricing methods to different categories of transactions, including tangible property, intangible property, services, and financial arrangements. The regulations specify acceptable transfer pricing methods, priority rules for method selection, and standards for documentation and contemporaneous analysis.

#### 2.2. The "Best Method" Rule

A distinctive feature of the US regime is the "best method" rule, which differs subtly but significantly from the OECD's "most appropriate method" approach. Under Treasury Regulation 1.482-1(c), the arm's length result is determined using the method that provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length result under the facts and circumstances. Factors considered in selecting the best method include the degree of comparability between controlled and uncontrolled transactions, the quality of data and assumptions, and the sensitivity of results to deficiencies in data.

The best method rule does not establish a hierarchy among transfer pricing methods. Instead, it requires taxpayers to use whichever method produces the most reliable result for the particular transaction being analyzed. This approach contrasts with earlier US regulations that prioritized certain methods over others and represents a convergence with OECD thinking, though the terminology remains distinct.

#### 2.3. Documentation and Penalties

Unlike many jurisdictions that have adopted the OECD's three-tiered documentation approach, the United States does not mandate master file or local file preparation. Instead, documentation is recommended but not legally required. However, maintaining contemporaneous documentation provides protection from transfer pricing penalties, creating a strong practical incentive for compliance.

US transfer pricing penalties apply to substantial valuation misstatements and substantial gross valuation misstatements. A 20% accuracy-related penalty applies if the transfer price claimed results in a substantial valuation misstatement, defined as a price adjustment exceeding the lesser of $5 million or 10% of gross receipts. A 40% penalty applies to gross valuation misstatements where adjustments exceed the lesser of $20 million or 20% of gross receipts. Taxpayers can avoid these penalties by demonstrating that contemporaneous documentation establishes that the method selected was reasonable.

Recent developments include Notice 2025-04, which announces that Amount B provisions from Pillar One will be available as an elective safe harbor for baseline marketing and distribution activities, demonstrating continued evolution of US transfer pricing rules.

### 3. United Kingdom Transfer Pricing Regime

#### 3.1. Legislative Framework: TIOPA 2010

The United Kingdom's transfer pricing legislation is contained in the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 (TIOPA 2010), specifically Parts 4 and 5. Part 4 addresses transfer pricing for transactions between related parties, while Part 5 covers diverted profits. This legislation replaced earlier provisions scattered across multiple tax acts, consolidating the UK's transfer pricing rules into a coherent framework.

TIOPA 2010 applies the arm's length principle to transactions between enterprises that are under common control or where one enterprise has control over another. The legislation defines "provision" broadly to encompass virtually any transaction, arrangement, or understanding between enterprises. Control is also defined expansively, capturing not only direct ownership relationships but also indirect control and control through connected persons.

#### 3.2. Explicit Incorporation of OECD Guidelines

A unique feature of the UK regime is Section 164 of TIOPA 2010, which explicitly provides that in determining whether provisions between related parties would have been made between independent enterprises and what those provisions would have been, regard shall be given to the OECD Guidelines. This explicit incorporation means that the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines have legal force in the United Kingdom and can be cited as authority in tax disputes.

The statutory incorporation of OECD Guidelines provides clarity and consistency in applying the arm's length principle. It ensures that developments in OECD thinking are automatically relevant to UK transfer pricing analysis without requiring legislative amendment. When the OECD updates its Guidelines, those updates become relevant to UK transfer pricing determinations through the statutory reference in Section 164.

#### 3.3. Documentation Requirements

For many years, the United Kingdom did not mandate specific transfer pricing documentation, instead expecting taxpayers to maintain records sufficient to support their tax returns. This changed effective April 1, 2023, when the UK introduced mandatory master file and local file requirements aligned with the OECD's BEPS Action 13 recommendations.

Under the new rules, UK-parented groups with consolidated revenues exceeding EUR 750 million must prepare a master file. UK entities that are members of such groups must prepare local files if they meet certain revenue thresholds. Small and medium-sized enterprise exemptions are available, reflecting a proportionate approach to compliance burdens. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) issued detailed guidance in publication GfC7 (updated September 2024) explaining the documentation requirements and providing practical compliance assistance.

Failure to maintain required documentation can result in penalties under existing provisions for failure to keep adequate records. More significantly, inadequate documentation undermines a taxpayer's ability to defend its transfer pricing positions during tax audits and disputes.

### 4. Germany Transfer Pricing Regime

#### 4.1. Legislative Framework: Foreign Tax Act (AStG)

Germany's transfer pricing legislation is primarily contained in Section 1 of the Außensteuergesetz (Foreign Tax Act, abbreviated AStG). Section 1 AStG requires that transactions between related parties be conducted on arm's length terms and authorizes adjustments where actual arrangements deviate from what independent parties would have agreed. The provision applies to both cross-border transactions and certain domestic arrangements.

Paragraph 1 establishes the fundamental arm's length principle, requiring that income from business relationships with related foreign entities be determined as if the relationships were between independent third parties. Paragraph 3 addresses the documentation of transfer pricing policies, imposing some of the most stringent documentation requirements found in any jurisdiction. The legislative framework is supplemented by detailed administrative guidance and regulations that specify documentation content, submission deadlines, and penalty provisions.

#### 4.2. Documentation Requirements and the Transaction Matrix

Germany has long imposed mandatory transfer pricing documentation requirements, well before BEPS Action 13 introduced the three-tiered documentation approach globally. German law requires taxpayers to prepare contemporaneous documentation that demonstrates compliance with the arm's length principle. This documentation must be maintained in German or, with consent, in English.

A distinctive feature of the German regime is the requirement for a transaction matrix, introduced in 2025 through amendments to Section 1(3a) AStG. The transaction matrix provides a structured overview of all related-party transactions, organized by transaction type and counterparty. This goes beyond the OECD's master file and local file framework, requiring an additional layer of disclosure that enables tax authorities to quickly identify all cross-border related-party arrangements within a corporate group.

Documentation must be provided to the tax authorities within 30 days of request, reduced from a previous 60-day deadline. This compressed timeline reflects Germany's expectation that documentation should be maintained contemporaneously rather than prepared in response to audit inquiries.

#### 4.3. Penalties and Compliance Deadlines

Germany enforces documentation requirements through a penalty regime that is among the strictest globally. Failure to provide adequate documentation within the statutory deadline triggers penalties ranging from a minimum of EUR 5,000 to a maximum of EUR 1,000,000. The penalty amount depends on the significance of the documentation deficiency and whether the failure appears deliberate or merely negligent.

These penalties apply regardless of whether the transfer prices actually conform to the arm's length principle. In other words, a taxpayer whose transfer pricing is entirely appropriate can still face substantial penalties for documentation failures. This approach reflects Germany's view that documentation serves both compliance and tax administration efficiency objectives, justifying penalties even absent substantive transfer pricing errors.

The stringency of German documentation requirements and penalties has made Germany a challenging jurisdiction for transfer pricing compliance, requiring multinational enterprises to maintain detailed, contemporaneous records for all German-related transactions.

### 5. Australia Transfer Pricing Regime

#### 5.1. Legislative Framework: ITAA 1997 Division 815

Australia's transfer pricing rules are contained in Division 815 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997). This Division, introduced in 2013, replaced earlier provisions and modernized Australia's transfer pricing framework to align with OECD Guidelines. Division 815 is divided into several subdivisions, each addressing different aspects of transfer pricing.

Subdivision 815-A contains definitions and general provisions. Subdivisions 815-B and 815-C contain the operative transfer pricing rules for cross-border arrangements between related parties. Subdivision 815-D addresses administrative matters including documentation. The legislative structure reflects Australia's comprehensive approach to incorporating transfer pricing principles into domestic law.

#### 5.2. The Self-Executing Approach

A distinctive feature of the Australian regime is found in Subdivision 815-B, which is described as "self-executing." Under this approach, if conditions of related-party dealings differ from arm's length conditions, the actual profits or losses for Australian tax purposes are automatically substituted with what profits or losses would have been under arm's length conditions. This substitution occurs by operation of law without requiring a determination by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

The self-executing nature of Subdivision 815-B places the primary responsibility for transfer pricing compliance on taxpayers themselves. Taxpayers must self-assess whether their arrangements meet arm's length standards and, if not, must self-adjust their taxable income accordingly. The ATO retains authority to review these self-assessments and make adjustments where it disagrees, but the initial compliance obligation rests with the taxpayer.

This approach differs from regimes where transfer pricing adjustments require affirmative action by tax authorities. It reflects Australia's broader system of self-assessment taxation, where taxpayers prepare returns based on their understanding of the law and tax authorities conduct subsequent reviews.

#### 5.3. Risk Zone System and Practical Compliance

While Division 815 does not mandate specific documentation formats, the ATO strongly encourages taxpayers to maintain documentation aligned with OECD standards. More importantly, Australia has developed a sophisticated risk assessment framework through Practical Compliance Guidelines (PCGs) that provide taxpayers with clarity about ATO compliance priorities.

PCGs identify "risk zones" ranging from low risk (green zone) through medium risk (amber zone) to high risk (red zone). Taxpayers whose arrangements fall within green zone parameters face minimal ATO scrutiny, while those in red zones can expect detailed review. This risk-based approach allows the ATO to focus resources on higher-risk arrangements while providing certainty to taxpayers whose practices fall within accepted parameters.

Recent guidance includes PCG 2024/1 addressing intangible arrangements and PCG 2025/D2 (draft) covering financing arrangements. These guidelines provide detailed criteria for assessing risk levels, including acceptable return benchmarks and documentation expectations. The PCG framework has become central to Australian transfer pricing compliance, providing practical guidance that supplements the legislative requirements in Division 815.

### 6. Comparative Analysis

#### 6.1. Summary Comparison

The following table summarizes key features of the four jurisdictions examined:

| Element | United States | United Kingdom | Germany | Australia |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Primary Legislation | IRC §482 | TIOPA 2010 | AStG §1 | ITAA 1997 Div 815 |
| OECD Alignment | Independent but aligned | Explicit incorporation | Aligned | Aligned |
| Method Selection | Best method | Most appropriate | Most appropriate | Most appropriate |
| Documentation | Recommended | Mandatory (2023) | Mandatory (most strict) | Recommended |
| Master/Local File | Not required | Required | Required + Transaction Matrix | Not required |
| Penalties | 20-40% underpayment | Standard tax penalties | EUR 5k-1m documentation | Standard tax penalties |

#### 6.2. Key Differences and Convergence

Despite different legislative approaches, significant convergence exists across these four jurisdictions in their application of the arm's length principle. All four accept the fundamental premise that related-party transactions should be priced as if conducted between independent parties. All four recognize the transfer pricing methods described in OECD Guidelines, even where domestic legislation uses different terminology.

The primary differences lie in documentation requirements, penalty structures, and the degree of explicit incorporation of OECD Guidelines. Germany and the UK mandate documentation, with Germany imposing additional requirements beyond OECD standards. The US and Australia recommend but do not mandate documentation, relying instead on penalty protection incentives and risk assessment frameworks to encourage compliance.

These jurisdictional differences create complexity for multinational enterprises, which must navigate varying documentation requirements, submission deadlines, and penalty exposures across their global operations. Understanding each jurisdiction's specific legislative framework is essential for effective transfer pricing compliance and risk management.
