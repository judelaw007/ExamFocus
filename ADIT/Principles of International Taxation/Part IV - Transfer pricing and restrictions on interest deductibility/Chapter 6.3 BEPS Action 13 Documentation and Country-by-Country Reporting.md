## Chapter 6.3: BEPS Action 13 – Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting

BEPS Action 13 established a standardised approach to transfer pricing documentation that fundamentally changed how multinational enterprises disclose information to tax administrations. The three-tiered documentation structure—comprising a master file, local file, and country-by-country report—provides tax administrations with comprehensive information for risk assessment while creating consistent global standards for taxpayer compliance.

### 1. Policy Objectives and Context

#### 1.1. Addressing Information Asymmetry

Prior to BEPS, transfer pricing documentation requirements varied significantly across jurisdictions. Some countries imposed detailed contemporaneous documentation requirements; others had minimal or no formal requirements. This inconsistency created substantial information asymmetry between multinational enterprises and tax administrations. Enterprises possessed comprehensive knowledge of their global structures, functions, and intercompany transactions, while individual tax administrations saw only fragments through local filings.

The information gap impeded effective transfer pricing risk assessment. Tax administrations struggled to identify which taxpayers warranted audit attention and which intercompany arrangements required scrutiny. Enterprises with aggressive transfer pricing positions faced limited detection risk in jurisdictions lacking robust information exchange mechanisms, while compliant enterprises in well-documented jurisdictions faced disproportionate scrutiny simply because information was available.

Action 13 addressed this asymmetry through mandatory standardised disclosure, ensuring all tax administrations receive comparable information in consistent formats. The approach recognizes that effective transfer pricing enforcement requires understanding not merely local transactions but the broader context of multinational group operations, intangible ownership structures, and global profit allocation.

The standardisation objective extends beyond content requirements to reporting formats. By establishing uniform templates and data definitions, Action 13 enables tax administrations to compare information across multinational groups and across jurisdictions without reconciling inconsistent formats or terminology. This comparability substantially enhances the utility of the information for risk assessment purposes.

#### 1.2. The Three-Tiered Structure

The Action 13 framework operates through three distinct documentation components, each serving different purposes. The master file provides a high-level overview of the multinational group's global business operations, organizational structure, intangibles, intercompany financial activities, and consolidated financial and tax positions. The local file focuses on specific intercompany transactions affecting the local taxpayer, including detailed transfer pricing analysis. The country-by-country report provides annual aggregate data on global allocation of income, taxes paid, and indicators of economic activity across all jurisdictions where the group operates.

This tiered approach balances comprehensive disclosure with proportionality. The master file provides context for understanding any individual local file, while the country-by-country report enables high-level risk assessment across the entire group. Together, the three documents give tax administrations the information needed to identify transfer pricing risks, focus audit resources effectively, and understand how group profits relate to economic substance across jurisdictions.

### 2. Master File Requirements

#### 2.1. Organisational and Business Overview

The master file begins with the multinational group's organisational structure, including a chart illustrating legal and ownership structure and geographic locations of operating entities. This structural overview enables tax administrations to understand how the taxpayer entity fits within the broader group and identify related parties potentially involved in intercompany transactions.

The business description component covers the nature of commercial activities, important drivers of business profit, a description of the supply chain for the group's five largest products or services by turnover plus any others exceeding five percent of group turnover, and significant service arrangements among group members. This operational overview helps tax administrations understand how value is created within the group and where key functions are performed.

The master file must also describe significant intercompany transactions, including restructurings, acquisitions, and divestitures occurring during the fiscal year. Understanding recent structural changes is essential for identifying transfers of value that may require arm's length compensation or that alter the functional profile of local entities.

#### 2.2. Intangibles and Financial Activities

Given the central role of intangibles in transfer pricing risks, the master file requires a general description of the group's strategy for development, ownership, and exploitation of intangibles. This includes identification of group members holding important intangibles, intercompany agreements relating to intangibles, transfer pricing policies for research and development and intangibles, and any significant transfers of intangible interests during the year.

The financial activities section addresses intercompany financing arrangements, including the identification of group members providing central financing functions, transfer pricing policies for financing arrangements, and the functional currency and financial accounting standards used. This information helps tax administrations understand how the group structures and prices its internal capital allocation.

The master file must also include the group's consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year and list any existing unilateral advance pricing agreements and other tax rulings relating to allocation of income among countries. This transparency regarding rulings enables tax administrations to understand arrangements that may affect income allocation and identify potential inconsistencies with arm's length treatment.

### 3. Local File Requirements

#### 3.1. Local Entity Information

The local file provides detailed information about the specific taxpayer entity and its intercompany transactions. It begins with a description of the local entity's management structure, organisational chart, individuals to whom local management reports, and countries where such individuals maintain their principal offices. This information helps establish the functional profile and decision-making location for the local entity.

The business strategy section describes any business strategies pursued by the local entity affecting transfer pricing outcomes, including business restructurings that transferred functions, assets, or risks to or from the local entity. Understanding strategic context is essential for evaluating whether transfer pricing arrangements reflect the entity's actual contributions to group value creation.

#### 3.2. Controlled Transaction Analysis

The core of the local file comprises detailed analysis of each category of controlled transactions. For each material transaction category, the documentation must describe the transaction, identify the amounts of payments and receipts, identify the associated enterprises involved, and provide copies of relevant intercompany agreements.

The transfer pricing analysis requires a detailed comparability analysis, including functional analysis examining functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed by both parties to the transaction. The documentation must explain the selection of tested party and transfer pricing method, identify comparables used with supporting analysis of how the search was conducted, and demonstrate how the pricing satisfies the arm's length principle.

Financial information supporting the transfer pricing analysis must include relevant financial data for the tested party and comparables, with explanation of how data was obtained and any adjustments made for comparability. The local file should demonstrate a clear link between financial data, transfer pricing analysis, and the pricing actually applied to controlled transactions. *(covered in June 2024)*

### 4. Country-by-Country Report

#### 4.1. Filing Threshold and Scope

Country-by-country reporting applies to multinational enterprise groups with annual consolidated group revenue equal to or exceeding EUR 750 million in the fiscal year immediately preceding the reporting fiscal year. The threshold reflects a deliberate policy choice balancing comprehensive coverage against compliance burden. Setting the threshold too low would impose significant costs on smaller enterprises with limited capacity to engage in sophisticated profit shifting, while setting it too high would exclude major multinationals whose global operations present the greatest transfer pricing risks. The EUR 750 million level captures approximately 85-90 percent of multinational corporate revenues while excluding smaller groups where compliance costs would be disproportionate to information benefits.

The report must be filed within twelve months of the last day of the reporting fiscal year. Unlike master file and local file requirements that may be requested upon audit, country-by-country reports are filed proactively and exchanged automatically between tax administrations, ensuring all relevant jurisdictions receive the information simultaneously.

#### 4.2. Table 1: Overview of Allocation of Income

Table 1 of the country-by-country report provides aggregate data for each tax jurisdiction where the multinational group has constituent entities or permanent establishments. The required data elements include total revenue, distinguishing between related party and unrelated party revenue, profit or loss before income tax, income tax paid on a cash basis, income tax accrued, stated capital, accumulated earnings, number of employees, and tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents.

This data enables tax administrations to perform high-level risk assessment by comparing profit allocation with indicators of economic activity such as employees and tangible assets. Jurisdictions where reported profits appear disproportionate to economic presence may warrant further examination, while the related party revenue data helps identify the scale of intercompany transactions potentially affecting profit allocation.

The revenue figures must distinguish between revenue from transactions with associated enterprises and revenue from unrelated parties, enabling tax administrations to assess the extent to which profits depend on intercompany arrangements versus arm's length market transactions. The income tax data—both cash and accrued—reveals effective tax rates and highlights jurisdictions where groups may be benefiting from preferential regimes or aggressive tax positions.

#### 4.3. Tables 2 and 3: Entity Details and Additional Information

Table 2 lists all constituent entities of the multinational group, organized by tax jurisdiction of residence. For each entity, the report must identify the jurisdiction of organization if different from residence, and describe the main business activities using standardised categories: research and development, holding or managing intellectual property, purchasing or procurement, manufacturing or production, sales, marketing or distribution, administrative management or support services, provision of services to unrelated parties, internal group finance, regulated financial services, insurance, holding shares or other equity instruments, dormant, or other.

Table 3 provides space for additional information the group considers necessary or helpful for understanding the data in Tables 1 and 2. This may include explanations of particular data entries, information about specific entities, or context regarding group structure or operations. While not strictly required, thoughtful use of Table 3 can prevent misinterpretation of data that might otherwise trigger unwarranted risk assessments. *(covered in December 2023)*

### 5. Filing Mechanisms and Exchange Framework

#### 5.1. Primary Filing Mechanism

The standard filing mechanism requires the ultimate parent entity of a multinational group to file the country-by-country report with the tax administration in its jurisdiction of tax residence. That jurisdiction then exchanges the report with all jurisdictions where the group has constituent entities, provided exchange agreements are in place. This primary mechanism ensures a single filing point for each multinational group while achieving global distribution of the information.

The primary mechanism depends on the ultimate parent entity's jurisdiction having implemented country-by-country reporting requirements and having established exchange relationships with relevant jurisdictions. Where these conditions are met, local constituent entities need not file locally, reducing compliance burden on multinational groups.

#### 5.2. Surrogate Parent Entity Filing

Where the ultimate parent entity's jurisdiction has not implemented country-by-country reporting or does not have exchange agreements with relevant jurisdictions, the multinational group may designate a surrogate parent entity in another jurisdiction to file on behalf of the group. The surrogate parent entity's jurisdiction must have implemented reporting requirements and must have exchange relationships enabling distribution of the report to relevant jurisdictions.

The surrogate mechanism provides flexibility when the primary mechanism fails, ensuring country-by-country reports reach tax administrations even when the ultimate parent's jurisdiction does not participate in the exchange framework. The group must notify all relevant jurisdictions of the identity of the surrogate parent entity and the jurisdiction where it will file.

#### 5.3. Local Filing Requirements

Local filing applies as a backstop when neither primary nor surrogate mechanisms deliver the country-by-country report to a jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may require local constituent entities to file the report locally when the ultimate parent's jurisdiction has not implemented reporting, has no exchange agreement with the local jurisdiction, has experienced systematic failure in exchange, or when the group has not designated an appropriate surrogate parent entity.

Local filing increases compliance burden for multinational groups since multiple entities may need to file the same report in different jurisdictions. The mechanism operates as a last resort ensuring no jurisdiction is excluded from receiving country-by-country reports simply because exchange arrangements are incomplete.

#### 5.4. Exchange of Information Framework

The Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports provides the primary framework for automatic exchange. Jurisdictions signing the MCAA commit to exchanging reports with all other signatories, subject to meeting confidentiality and data protection standards. As of 2025, over 100 jurisdictions have joined the MCAA, establishing more than 4,450 bilateral exchange relationships for country-by-country reports.

The exchange framework operates on the basis of strict reciprocity. A jurisdiction only receives reports from other jurisdictions if it has itself implemented country-by-country reporting and exchanges its own reports. This mutual commitment ensures comprehensive global coverage and prevents jurisdictions from benefiting from others' information without contributing their own.

Bilateral exchange agreements may also facilitate country-by-country report exchange outside the MCAA framework. Some jurisdictions have established exchange relationships through bilateral competent authority agreements under existing tax treaties or tax information exchange agreements. These bilateral arrangements supplement the multilateral framework, particularly for jurisdictions not participating in the MCAA or where specific bilateral protocols are preferred. *(covered in June 2023)*

### 6. Confidentiality and Appropriate Use

#### 6.1. Confidentiality Requirements

Country-by-country reports contain commercially sensitive information, and the exchange framework includes robust confidentiality protections. Business groups raised significant concerns during Action 13 development that aggregated financial data by jurisdiction could reveal competitive strategies, profit margins, and operational decisions to competitors if disclosed publicly or leaked. These concerns shaped the framework's emphasis on strict confidentiality as a precondition for exchange. Receiving jurisdictions must protect exchanged information to the same standards as information obtained under the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters or applicable bilateral tax treaties. Unauthorized disclosure or use constitutes a breach potentially triggering suspension of exchange relationships.

The confidentiality requirements extend to all aspects of the data, including treatment as tax return information subject to domestic confidentiality protections. Jurisdictions must have appropriate legal frameworks, information security measures, and oversight mechanisms before participating in exchange. The Inclusive Framework monitors compliance through peer review assessments.

#### 6.2. Appropriate Use Limitations

The OECD guidance establishes strict limitations on how tax administrations may use country-by-country report data. The reports are intended for high-level transfer pricing risk assessment, assessing other base erosion and profit shifting related risks, and where appropriate, for economic and statistical analysis. The data should not be used as a substitute for detailed transfer pricing analysis of individual transactions or as conclusive evidence that transfer pricing is appropriate or inappropriate.

The appropriate use guidance reflects the aggregate nature of the data. Country-by-country reports provide indicators of potential risk rather than evidence of non-compliance. A jurisdiction showing high profits relative to employees may reflect legitimate business models—such as capital-intensive operations or holding company structures—rather than artificial profit shifting. Tax administrations must conduct further analysis before drawing conclusions.

The reports must not be used for arbitrary or capricious adjustments or formulary apportionment of income. Using aggregate country-level data to allocate profits mechanically would contradict the arm's length principle's focus on transaction-by-transaction analysis. The appropriate use limitations preserve the arm's length standard while enabling improved risk assessment.

### 7. Implementation and Peer Review

#### 7.1. Global Implementation

Action 13 constitutes one of the BEPS minimum standards, requiring all Inclusive Framework members to implement the three-tiered documentation approach. As of 2025, 142 jurisdictions have undergone peer review for Action 13 implementation, with the vast majority achieving satisfactory ratings. Implementation has proceeded through domestic legislation in each jurisdiction, with some variation in effective dates and local adaptations within the framework's flexibility provisions.

The implementation rate reflects strong international commitment to enhanced transfer pricing transparency. Major economies implemented requirements beginning with fiscal years from 2016, with developing countries following through subsequent years. The Inclusive Framework provides capacity building support to assist jurisdictions in establishing necessary legal frameworks, IT infrastructure, and administrative processes.

#### 7.2. Peer Review Process

The Inclusive Framework conducts regular peer reviews assessing each member's domestic legal and administrative framework, exchange framework including appropriate agreements in place and effective exchange, and appropriate use including confidentiality. Reviews evaluate whether domestic legislation meets Action 13 standards and whether practical implementation achieves the standard's objectives.

Peer review findings inform improvements in implementation. Jurisdictions receiving recommendations must address deficiencies within specified timeframes, with follow-up monitoring ensuring progress. The review process maintains consistent global standards and identifies jurisdictions requiring technical assistance to achieve compliance.

The peer review methodology examines three core elements. First, reviewers assess whether domestic legal and administrative frameworks properly implement the Action 13 minimum standard, including appropriate filing thresholds, content requirements, and enforcement mechanisms. Second, reviewers evaluate whether jurisdictions have established necessary exchange relationships and whether exchanges actually occur as required. Third, reviewers assess confidentiality protections and appropriate use limitations, ensuring receiving jurisdictions protect information adequately and use it only for permitted purposes.

#### 7.3. Evolution and Refinements

The Inclusive Framework has refined Action 13 guidance through experience since initial implementation. Clarifications address questions arising in practice, including treatment of investment funds, partnerships, and stateless entities. The framework continues evolving to address implementation challenges while maintaining consistency across jurisdictions.

Looking forward, discussions continue regarding potential public disclosure of country-by-country report data. The European Union has adopted Directive 2021/2101 requiring public country-by-country reporting for large multinationals operating in the EU, with first reports due in 2026 covering fiscal years beginning after June 2024. Separately, the Global Reporting Initiative's GRI 207 Tax Standard provides voluntary disclosure frameworks that some multinationals have adopted proactively. These developments extend the transparency objectives of Action 13 beyond confidential exchange between tax administrations toward broader public accountability. *(covered in December 2024)*
