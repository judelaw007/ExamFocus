## Chapter 1.1: Pillar One - Amount A, Amount B and the Multilateral Convention

### 1. BEPS Action 1 and the Origins of Pillar One

#### 1.1. The Digital Economy Challenge

The digital economy has fundamentally challenged traditional international tax principles by enabling enterprises to achieve substantial economic presence in jurisdictions without physical operations. Digital businesses can serve millions of users, collect valuable data, and generate significant revenue in a market while maintaining no offices, warehouses, or employees in that jurisdiction. This capability exposed critical limitations in the permanent establishment concept, which historically required physical presence as a precondition for source-based taxation.

Traditional nexus rules were designed for an economy characterized by tangible goods and physical distribution networks. In the digital economy, value creation increasingly derives from intangible assets, data collection, user participation, and network effects. This mismatch between value creation and taxation rights created opportunities for profit shifting and base erosion.

#### 1.2. The OECD/G20 BEPS Project

In response to growing concerns about international tax avoidance, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Group of Twenty (G20) countries launched the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project in 2013. The BEPS initiative comprised fifteen action items addressing various aspects of profit shifting and aggressive tax planning. Action 1 specifically focused on addressing the tax challenges of the digital economy.

After extensive analysis, the OECD concluded that digitalization challenges were not confined to purely digital businesses but represented fundamental issues affecting the international tax system as a whole. The 2015 BEPS package delivered comprehensive recommendations but acknowledged that addressing the digital economy required further consideration. Consequently, the OECD established the Inclusive Framework on BEPS, bringing together over 140 jurisdictions to develop consensus-based solutions.

#### 1.3. The Two-Pillar Solution

Following intensive negotiation within the Inclusive Framework, members agreed in October 2021 on a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization and globalization. Pillar One focuses on reallocating taxing rights to market jurisdictions where users and customers are located, regardless of physical presence. Pillar Two establishes a global minimum corporate tax rate to reduce profit shifting incentives.

Pillar One represents a paradigm shift in international taxation by departing from the physical presence requirement and acknowledging that market jurisdictions contribute to value creation even without traditional permanent establishments. The solution allocates a portion of residual profits of the largest multinational enterprises to market jurisdictions based on sales revenue.

### 2. The Multilateral Convention to Implement Amount A of Pillar One

#### 2.1. Nature and Purpose of the Convention

The Multilateral Convention to Implement Amount A of Pillar One represents the primary legal instrument for operationalizing the new profit allocation rules. Given that over 140 jurisdictions participate in the Inclusive Framework, implementing Amount A through bilateral tax treaty amendments would be impractical. The multilateral convention approach enables simultaneous modification of existing bilateral treaties among all signatories, ensuring consistency across jurisdictions.

The convention establishes binding legal obligations on contracting parties to apply Amount A rules, provide tax certainty mechanisms, eliminate double taxation, and remove digital services taxes. It operates alongside existing bilateral tax treaties rather than replacing them, modifying specific provisions related to profit allocation while preserving other treaty benefits.

#### 2.2. Key Features of the Convention

The convention establishes comprehensive rules governing the scope of Amount A, specifying which multinational groups fall within the new allocation framework through precise revenue and profitability thresholds. Groups meeting these thresholds become subject to the Amount A reallocation mechanism, which extracts a portion of residual profits and redistributes them to eligible market jurisdictions based on sales revenue sourced to each jurisdiction.

A critical feature addresses the elimination of double taxation arising from Amount A reallocation. When market jurisdictions tax reallocated profits, the convention requires residence jurisdictions to provide corresponding relief through the relieving of dual taxation on profits mechanism. This ensures that the same profits are not taxed twice while market jurisdictions receive their allocated taxing rights under the new rules.

The convention incorporates robust tax certainty mechanisms recognizing that Amount A introduces complexity and potential disputes regarding scope determination, revenue sourcing, and profit calculation. Mandatory binding dispute resolution procedures ensure that disagreements between jurisdictions can be resolved efficiently without subjecting multinational enterprises to sustained uncertainty or double taxation.

Administrative provisions establish coordinated procedures for Amount A compliance, including centralized filing mechanisms. The convention requires signatories to withdraw existing digital services taxes and commit not to introduce new similar measures, offering market jurisdictions a share of residual profits through Amount A as an alternative to unilateral taxation.

#### 2.3. Implementation Status and Challenges

The Multilateral Convention was published by the OECD in October 2023, but the convention is not yet open for signature as of early 2025. Implementation faces significant challenges that have delayed its entry into force. The convention requires ratification by at least thirty jurisdictions representing at least sixty percent of the ultimate parent entities of in-scope multinational groups before it enters into force.

A major setback occurred in January 2025 when the United States withdrew from the Pillar One framework. Given that many of the largest and most profitable multinational groups are headquartered in the United States, this withdrawal significantly undermines the viability of Amount A. Market jurisdictions are reluctant to proceed without US participation, as they would forgo taxing rights over US-headquartered multinationals while subjecting their own resident companies to Amount A reallocation obligations.

In response to implementation delays and the uncertain future of Amount A, several jurisdictions have reinstated or extended digital services taxes that were intended to be withdrawn upon Amount A implementation. This development threatens to fragment the international tax system and create the double taxation and legal uncertainty that Pillar One was designed to prevent.

Despite challenges surrounding Amount A, Amount B has proceeded with implementation. The OECD released finalized Amount B guidance in February 2024, and jurisdictions have begun incorporating Amount B into their transfer pricing frameworks from January 2025. Amount B operates independently of the multilateral convention as a transfer pricing simplification measure, enabling its adoption without the complex ratification requirements facing Amount A.

### 3. Amount A: Reallocation of Taxing Rights

#### 3.1. Overview and Policy Rationale

Amount A represents the core profit reallocation mechanism under Pillar One, redistributing a portion of the residual profits of large and highly profitable multinational groups to market jurisdictions where customers and users are located. This reallocation acknowledges that traditional profit allocation rules fail to capture the value created through sustained and significant participation by users and customers in market jurisdictions. *(covered in December 2022)*

The policy rationale recognizes that modern business models, particularly those leveraging digital technologies, derive substantial value from market jurisdictions even without physical operations. User data, brand recognition, network effects, and customer engagement all contribute to profitability in ways not adequately reflected in traditional transfer pricing analyses. By allocating a formulary share of residual profits to market jurisdictions based on sales revenue, Amount A provides these jurisdictions with taxing rights commensurate with their contribution to value creation.

Amount A applies only to the largest and most profitable multinational groups, targeting enterprises where the disconnect between traditional allocation rules and economic substance is most pronounced. The framework operates through a five-step process encompassing scope determination, market jurisdiction identification, profit calculation and allocation, double taxation elimination, and filing and payment procedures.

#### 3.2. Step 1 - Scope Determination

Determining whether a multinational group falls within Amount A scope requires applying both quantitative thresholds and qualitative exclusions. *(examined in December 2022)* A multinational group enters Amount A scope only if its total consolidated group revenue exceeds twenty billion euros. This high threshold ensures that Amount A applies exclusively to the largest global enterprises. The revenue threshold may be reduced to ten billion euros after seven years of operation, subject to review and agreement by Inclusive Framework members.

The second quantitative threshold requires that the group's profit before tax exceed ten percent of revenue, identifying highly profitable enterprises that generate substantial residual profits beyond routine returns. Groups falling below this profitability threshold are excluded regardless of revenue size. Current estimates suggest that approximately one hundred multinational groups worldwide meet both the revenue and profitability thresholds.

Regulated financial services entities are excluded from Amount A through a specific carve-out. *(discussed in December 2022)* The exclusion applies through a three-element test examining the entity's licensing status, capital adequacy requirements, and predominant activities. An entity qualifies for exclusion if it is licensed and subject to regulatory capital requirements in its jurisdiction of residence and derives at least seventy-five percent of its revenues from one or more of seven specified categories of regulated financial activities. These categories include deposit-taking and lending, insurance underwriting, investment fund management, pension provision, securitization, repo transactions, and central counterparty services.

The seventy-five percent predominance test ensures that only entities genuinely focused on regulated financial services receive the exclusion, preventing groups from establishing financial services subsidiaries primarily to avoid Amount A obligations. Diversified financial conglomerates with significant non-financial activities may find portions of their operations subject to Amount A.

Policy arguments supporting the regulated financial services exclusion emphasize that financial institutions operate under comprehensive prudential regulation designed to ensure financial stability, maintain adequate capital buffers, and protect depositors and policyholders. These regulatory frameworks already constrain profit allocation and require capital to be maintained in specific jurisdictions, making additional formulary reallocation potentially inconsistent with prudential objectives. Furthermore, financial services typically involve bilateral relationships with customers rather than the multi-jurisdictional network effects characteristic of highly digital businesses.

Arguments against the exclusion contend that some financial services, particularly investment management and insurance distribution, increasingly leverage digital platforms and derive value from customers across multiple jurisdictions without corresponding physical presence. Excluding all regulated financial services may create competitive distortions between financial and non-financial providers of similar services and reduce Amount A revenue for market jurisdictions. The exclusion benefits jurisdictions hosting major financial centers at the expense of market jurisdictions where financial services customers are located.

#### 3.3. Step 2 - Identification of Eligible Market Jurisdictions

Once a group is determined to be within Amount A scope, the next step identifies which jurisdictions qualify as eligible market jurisdictions entitled to receive allocated profits. The standard nexus threshold requires that the in-scope group source at least one million euros of revenue to a jurisdiction in a fiscal year for that jurisdiction to qualify as an eligible market jurisdiction.

Recognizing that a uniform threshold could be disproportionately high for smaller economies, the framework provides a reduced nexus threshold of two hundred and fifty thousand euros for jurisdictions with gross domestic product below forty billion euros. This accommodation ensures that smaller jurisdictions with significant market activity relative to their economy size can benefit from Amount A reallocation.

Revenue sourcing follows specific rules designed to identify where customers are located and economic value is derived. For sales of goods, revenue is generally sourced to the jurisdiction of final delivery. For services, sourcing depends on where the customer uses or consumes the service. Digital services revenue is sourced based on user or customer location, determined through various indicators including IP addresses, billing addresses, and location data.

#### 3.4. Step 3 - Calculation and Allocation of Profit

The calculation begins by determining the group's residual profit, defined as profit before tax exceeding ten percent of revenue. This residual represents above-normal returns attributable to factors beyond routine business operations, such as valuable intangible assets, strong brand recognition, and market power.

Amount A extracts twenty-five percent of this residual profit for reallocation to market jurisdictions. The twenty-five percent figure reflects a political compromise balancing market jurisdiction demands for meaningful taxing rights against residence jurisdiction concerns about preserving adequate revenue. The reallocated profit is distributed among eligible market jurisdictions in proportion to each jurisdiction's share of the group's total revenue.

Consider a multinational group with thirty billion euros revenue and four billion euros profit before tax, achieving profitability of approximately thirteen percent. The residual profit exceeding ten percent of revenue equals one billion euros. Amount A extracts twenty-five percent of this residual, producing two hundred and fifty million euros for reallocation. This amount is then distributed among all eligible market jurisdictions based on their respective revenue shares.

#### 3.5. Step 4 - Elimination of Double Taxation

Reallocating profits to market jurisdictions creates a potential double taxation problem, as these profits were already allocated to other group entities under traditional transfer pricing rules. The Multilateral Convention addresses this concern through the relieving of dual taxation on profits mechanism, which requires residence jurisdictions to provide tax relief corresponding to Amount A allocations made to market jurisdictions.

Relief is provided by reducing the tax liability in the residence jurisdiction by an amount corresponding to the tax paid by market jurisdictions on Amount A allocations. This ensures that the total tax burden on the reallocated profits equals the rate applied in market jurisdictions, preventing double taxation while ensuring that market jurisdictions obtain the intended revenue from their Amount A allocations.

#### 3.6. Step 5 - Filing, Payment, and Relief Mechanisms

The administrative implementation of Amount A requires coordinated procedures for determining obligations, filing returns, making payments, and obtaining relief from double taxation. The framework contemplates a lead tax administration approach where one designated jurisdiction coordinates Amount A administration for each in-scope group. The lead administration receives the consolidated Amount A filing, calculates allocations to each eligible market jurisdiction, and coordinates payments and relief processes.

In-scope groups must file Amount A returns containing detailed information about global revenue, profitability, revenue sourcing to each jurisdiction, and Amount A calculations. Tax certainty procedures provide advance certainty regarding Amount A treatment through preventive processes and resolve disputes through mandatory binding arbitration.

### 4. Amount B: Simplification for Baseline Marketing and Distribution

#### 4.1. Overview and Objectives

Amount B represents a distinct component of Pillar One focused on simplifying transfer pricing for baseline marketing and distribution activities. Unlike Amount A, which reallocates residual profits through a formulary mechanism, Amount B establishes standardized arm's length returns for routine distribution functions, reducing disputes and compliance costs associated with traditional transfer pricing analysis.

The policy rationale for Amount B recognizes that transfer pricing disputes frequently involve distribution activities where taxpayers and tax authorities disagree about appropriate profit margins. By establishing agreed baseline returns for qualifying distribution activities, Amount B provides certainty while preserving transfer pricing principles. Amount B became operational from January 2025 following finalization of detailed guidance by the OECD in February 2024.

#### 4.2. Scope of Amount B

Amount B applies to baseline marketing and distribution activities performed by wholesale distributors and sales agents that meet specified criteria. A wholesale distributor purchases goods from related parties and resells them to unrelated customers, performing marketing and sales support functions while the related party supplier retains strategic functions, valuable intangibles, and significant risks. Sales agents earn commissions for selling goods on behalf of related party principals without taking title to the goods.

Qualifying distributors and agents must operate at arm's length with limited functions, assets, and risks. They do not own valuable intangibles related to the products distributed, make strategic decisions about market entry or product positioning, or assume significant inventory or credit risks beyond normal commercial practice. Certain complex or strategic distribution arrangements are explicitly excluded from Amount B, including distribution of commodities, digital goods, services, and highly specialized products where market comparables are scarce.

#### 4.3. The Pricing Framework

The Amount B pricing framework establishes standardized net profit margins for qualifying distribution activities based on industry sector and regional characteristics. A matrix approach specifies return ranges for different combinations of industry and geography, derived from extensive analysis of comparable independent distributors operating in similar markets.

Taxpayers apply the Amount B matrix to determine an appropriate net profit margin for qualifying distribution activities, eliminating the need for individual benchmarking studies. The framework includes a cross-check mechanism addressing situations where specific characteristics of the distribution arrangement justify deviation from standard matrix returns, examining factors such as operating expense ratios.

#### 4.4. Tax Certainty Under Amount B

A key benefit of Amount B is enhanced tax certainty for qualifying distribution activities. By establishing agreed returns and standardized methodologies, Amount B substantially reduces the probability of transfer pricing disputes between taxpayers and tax authorities or between jurisdictions taking conflicting positions on appropriate distribution margins.

When distributors and agents operate within Amount B scope and apply the framework correctly, tax authorities commit to accepting the resulting transfer prices as arm's length. This commitment provides taxpayers with confidence that their pricing will withstand scrutiny, reducing provisions for uncertain tax positions and minimizing the risk of double taxation from conflicting adjustments by different jurisdictions.

### 5. Interaction Between Amount A and Amount B

#### 5.1. Sequential Allocation Framework

Amount A and Amount B operate as complementary components of a comprehensive framework addressing profit allocation for multinational groups. The interaction between these mechanisms follows a sequential logic where Amount B establishes baseline returns for routine distribution activities before Amount A reallocates residual profits to market jurisdictions.

For a multinational group subject to both mechanisms, Amount B determines appropriate returns for qualifying distribution and sales activities in various markets. The profits allocated to distributors under Amount B are then excluded from residual profits available for Amount A reallocation, preventing double allocation of the same profits to market jurisdictions.

#### 5.2. Reducing Transfer Pricing Disputes

The combination of Amount A and Amount B addresses transfer pricing disputes through different mechanisms suited to different aspects of profit allocation. Amount B directly reduces disputes about baseline distribution margins by establishing standardized returns, while Amount A reduces disputes about residual profit allocation by providing market jurisdictions with taxing rights through a formulary mechanism rather than attempting to attribute residual profits through traditional transfer pricing analysis.

Traditional transfer pricing methods struggle to allocate residual profits attributable to group-level intangibles and synergies, leading to disputes about profit split methodologies and comparable selection. Amount A sidesteps these disputes by acknowledging that residual profits should be allocated partly based on market revenue rather than exclusively through functional analysis.

#### 5.3. Alignment of Transfer Pricing and Residual Reallocation

The framework achieves alignment between traditional transfer pricing principles and the formulary reallocation of residual profits by preserving transfer pricing for routine functions while introducing formulary allocation only for residual profits where traditional methods prove inadequate. This hybrid approach maintains continuity with existing transfer pricing frameworks for the majority of transactions while innovating in areas where arm's length principles produce unsatisfactory results.

Amount B strengthens this alignment by demonstrating continued commitment to arm's length principles for baseline activities while acknowledging that standardization within the arm's length framework can reduce disputes and compliance costs. The interaction between Amount A and Amount B illustrates how different allocation methodologies can coexist within a coherent framework suited to different types of profits and activities.

#### 5.4. Preventing Profit Shifting

Amount A and Amount B collectively strengthen the international tax framework's resistance to profit shifting and base erosion. Amount B reduces opportunities for manipulating distribution margins by establishing standardized returns that limit both upward and downward deviations from baseline profitability. This standardization makes it more difficult for groups to concentrate profits in low-tax jurisdictions by suppressing distribution margins in high-tax markets.

Amount A addresses profit shifting by ensuring that market jurisdictions receive taxing rights over a portion of residual profits regardless of where the group has located strategic functions or valuable intangibles. The formulary allocation based on sales revenue prevents groups from avoiding market jurisdiction taxation by locating all valuable activities in low-tax jurisdictions. Even if a group successfully minimizes physical presence and permanent establishment exposure in market jurisdictions, Amount A allocates profits to those jurisdictions based on customer location. This combination creates a more robust international tax framework less vulnerable to aggressive planning structures.
