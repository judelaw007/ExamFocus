## Chapter 1.2: Pillar Two - The Global Minimum Tax Framework

### 1. Origins and Objectives of Pillar Two

#### 1.1. The Tax Competition Challenge

The intensification of global tax competition throughout the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries created significant challenges for the international tax system. Jurisdictions increasingly competed to attract mobile capital and multinational enterprise operations by reducing corporate tax rates and offering preferential tax regimes. While such competition can promote economic efficiency, it also generates substantial negative externalities for the broader international community.

Aggressive tax competition enables multinational groups to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions without corresponding shifts in real economic activity. Through transfer pricing manipulation, strategic location of intellectual property, and exploitation of mismatches between jurisdictions' tax systems, sophisticated enterprises can achieve effective tax rates substantially below statutory rates. This profit shifting erodes tax revenues, distorts investment decisions, and undermines public confidence in the tax system.

The race to the bottom dynamic creates particular challenges for developing countries with limited bargaining power and constrained fiscal capacity. When major economies reduce corporate tax rates to attract investment, smaller jurisdictions face pressure to reduce their own rates or risk capital flight. The resulting erosion of the corporate tax base shifts the tax burden onto less mobile factors such as labor and consumption, raising equity concerns.

#### 1.2. The Global Minimum Tax Solution

Pillar Two addresses these challenges through a coordinated global minimum tax framework designed to establish a floor beneath which effective tax rates cannot fall. By ensuring that multinational enterprises pay at least a minimum level of tax on profits earned in each jurisdiction, Pillar Two reduces incentives for profit shifting while preserving jurisdictions' sovereignty to set tax rates above the minimum threshold.

The framework operates through a comprehensive set of interlocking rules that collectively ensure income of large multinational groups is subject to at least fifteen percent effective taxation. This minimum rate represents a political compromise between jurisdictions advocating for higher rates to protect their tax bases and those concerned about maintaining competitive tax environments. The fifteen percent threshold provides meaningful revenue protection while remaining substantially below the statutory rates prevailing in most major economies.

Pillar Two advances several policy objectives beyond simply raising revenue. By reducing returns to profit shifting, the framework encourages multinationals to locate real economic activities based on commercial considerations rather than tax minimization strategies. The coordinated international approach prevents jurisdictions from gaining competitive advantages through aggressive tax competition, creating a more level playing field while facilitating long-term investment planning.

### 2. Scope and Application

#### 2.1. The EUR 750 Million Revenue Threshold

Pillar Two applies to multinational groups with consolidated annual revenues of at least seven hundred and fifty million euros. This threshold aligns with the country-by-country reporting requirement established under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 13, creating consistency across BEPS 2.0 measures and leveraging existing compliance infrastructure. The threshold ensures that Pillar Two focuses on the largest multinational enterprises where profit shifting concerns are most pronounced.

Groups determine whether they exceed the threshold based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with an acceptable financial accounting standard. The calculation examines revenue for at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year, preventing groups from temporarily reducing revenue to avoid Pillar Two obligations.

Current estimates suggest that fewer than ten thousand multinational groups worldwide exceed this threshold, representing a small fraction of all corporate taxpayers but accounting for a substantial proportion of cross-border profit shifting activities. By focusing on this population, Pillar Two targets compliance obligations where they will generate the greatest revenue protection benefits.

#### 2.2. Excluded Entities

Despite meeting the revenue threshold, certain categories of entities are excluded from Pillar Two based on their special characteristics and policy considerations. Governmental entities, international organizations, and non-profit organizations are excluded recognizing their public interest missions and limited profit-seeking orientation. These entities typically benefit from exemptions under domestic tax systems, and subjecting them to minimum taxation would conflict with their fundamental purposes.

Pension funds receive exclusion based on their role in retirement security and long-term savings mobilization. Investment funds and real estate investment vehicles similarly receive exclusions reflecting their pass-through nature and the principle that taxation should occur at the investor level rather than the fund level.

The excluded entities framework includes specific definitional criteria to prevent abuse. An entity qualifies for governmental entity exclusion only if it forms an integral part of government or is wholly owned by government. Non-profit organizations must be established and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, athletic, educational, or similar purposes, with restrictions on profit distribution. These definitional safeguards prevent commercial enterprises from exploiting exclusions through restructuring.

### 3. The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR)

#### 3.1. Mechanics and ETR Calculation

The Income Inclusion Rule represents the primary enforcement mechanism for Pillar Two, operating at the ultimate parent entity level to capture under-taxed profits of lower-tier group members. The IIR requires the parent entity's jurisdiction to impose top-up tax when subsidiaries or permanent establishments in other jurisdictions are taxed below the fifteen percent minimum effective tax rate. This top-down approach ensures comprehensive coverage while minimizing compliance obligations by centralizing calculations at the parent level.

Effective Tax Rate (ETR) calculation forms the foundation of IIR operation. The ETR for each jurisdiction equals covered taxes divided by Global anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) income, where both numerator and denominator derive from financial accounting statements with specified adjustments. GloBE income begins with net income or loss determined under the financial accounting standard used in the ultimate parent entity's consolidated financial statements, then applies adjustments to address timing differences, permanent differences, and policy exclusions. Covered taxes include all taxes on income or profits included in the financial accounts, subject to adjustments for uncertain tax positions and refundable tax credits. *(covered in June 2023)*

The jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction approach calculates separate ETRs for each jurisdiction where the group operates rather than blending taxation globally. This prevents high taxes in some jurisdictions from offsetting low taxes in others, ensuring that profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions triggers top-up tax obligations. Consider a multinational group with operations in Jurisdiction A imposing thirty percent tax and Jurisdiction B imposing five percent tax. Under a blended approach, the group might achieve an overall fifteen percent rate without top-up tax. The jurisdictional approach correctly identifies that Jurisdiction B profits are under-taxed and requires top-up tax on those profits specifically.

#### 3.2. Top-Up Tax Determination

Once the ETR for each jurisdiction is calculated, top-up tax determination follows a straightforward formula. The top-up tax percentage equals the difference between fifteen percent and the jurisdiction's ETR. This top-up tax percentage applies to excess profits, defined as GloBE income minus substance-based income exclusion. The resulting top-up tax amount is allocated to the ultimate parent entity for payment to its jurisdiction of residence.

Consider a multinational group with a subsidiary in a jurisdiction with a ten percent ETR. The subsidiary generates one hundred million euros GloBE income and qualifies for five million euros substance-based income exclusion. Excess profits equal ninety-five million euros. The top-up tax percentage equals five percent, being the difference between the fifteen percent minimum and the ten percent ETR. The top-up tax therefore equals four million seven hundred and fifty thousand euros, imposed on the ultimate parent entity.

The IIR creates strong incentives for jurisdictions to maintain effective tax rates at or above fifteen percent. If a jurisdiction imposes tax below the minimum rate, it loses tax revenue to parent jurisdictions collecting top-up tax. This dynamic encourages jurisdictions to adopt qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes that retain revenue domestically rather than allowing it to flow to other jurisdictions through the IIR.

### 4. The Under-Taxed Profit Rule (UTPR)

#### 4.1. Backstop Function

The Under-Taxed Profit Rule operates as a backstop to the Income Inclusion Rule, ensuring that Pillar Two minimum taxation applies even when the IIR does not fully capture under-taxed profits. UTPR becomes relevant when the ultimate parent entity is located in a jurisdiction that has not implemented the IIR, when the group structure includes intermediate parent entities in non-IIR jurisdictions, or when the IIR does not apply due to ownership structures or specific exclusions.

The UTPR operates by denying deductions or imposing equivalent taxation at the level of group entities in UTPR-implementing jurisdictions. This bottom-up approach complements the IIR's top-down mechanism, creating comprehensive coverage regardless of where the ultimate parent is located. The UTPR allocation occurs only after the IIR has been applied, ensuring that UTPR serves as a true backstop.

Consider a multinational group headquartered in a jurisdiction that has not implemented the IIR. The UTPR addresses this gap by allocating top-up tax to subsidiaries located in UTPR-implementing jurisdictions, effectively capturing the same revenue that would have been collected through the IIR.

#### 4.2. Allocation Formula

UTPR top-up tax is allocated among group entities in UTPR-implementing jurisdictions based on a formula incorporating both employee headcount and tangible asset values. The allocation formula assigns fifty percent weight to employees and fifty percent weight to tangible assets, reflecting the view that these factors indicate where a group maintains real economic substance.

The employee component counts all employees regardless of function or seniority, with full-time equivalent adjustments for part-time workers. The tangible asset component includes the net book value of tangible assets such as property, plant, equipment, and inventory, excluding intangible assets and financial assets. Top-up tax is allocated proportionally based on each jurisdiction's share of total employees and tangible assets.

Consider a group with UTPR top-up tax of ten million euros and entities in three UTPR-implementing jurisdictions. Jurisdiction X with forty percent of employees and thirty percent of tangible assets receives thirty-five percent of UTPR top-up tax based on its combined share. This allocation ensures that jurisdictions where the group maintains substantial operations contribute to capturing under-taxed profits.

### 5. The Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) and Multilateral Convention

#### 5.1. The 9% Threshold and Covered Payments

The Subject to Tax Rule represents a distinct component of Pillar Two focused on protecting source country taxing rights over specific categories of intra-group payments. Unlike the IIR and UTPR, which address entity-level effective tax rates, the STTR operates on a payment-by-payment basis to prevent base erosion through deductible payments that face minimal taxation in the recipient jurisdiction. The STTR applies when covered payments are subject to nominal tax rates below nine percent in the payee jurisdiction.

Covered payments under the STTR include interest, royalties, and certain categories of service fees that present heightened base erosion risks. These payments are deductible in the payer jurisdiction while generating income in the payee jurisdiction, creating opportunities for profit shifting if the payee jurisdiction imposes low taxation. By permitting source jurisdictions to impose additional withholding tax when recipient jurisdiction taxation falls below nine percent, the STTR ensures a minimum level of taxation on these mobile income categories.

The nine percent threshold for the STTR differs from the fifteen percent threshold applicable to the IIR and UTPR, reflecting different policy considerations. The lower STTR threshold acknowledges that developing countries face particular challenges with base erosion through deductible payments and need stronger protection mechanisms. The nine percent rate provides meaningful revenue protection while remaining below levels that would completely eliminate tax competition for mobile income categories.

#### 5.2. The Multilateral Convention for STTR

The STTR operates through tax treaty modifications rather than domestic legislation, requiring amendments to bilateral tax treaties between contracting jurisdictions. Given the impracticality of negotiating bilateral amendments to thousands of existing tax treaties, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed a Multilateral Convention to facilitate swift and coordinated STTR implementation. This multilateral instrument enables jurisdictions to modify their bilateral tax treaties simultaneously through a single ratification process.

The Multilateral Convention for STTR follows the model established by the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, commonly known as the Multilateral Instrument. Signatories to the STTR convention agree to modify their existing bilateral tax treaties with other signatories to incorporate STTR provisions, subject to specified reservations and options. This approach dramatically reduces the transaction costs of treaty modification while ensuring consistent STTR implementation across participating jurisdictions.

The convention establishes procedures for determining when the STTR applies, calculating the appropriate withholding tax, providing foreign tax credits, and resolving disputes. Source jurisdictions may impose withholding tax on covered payments to the extent necessary to bring total taxation up to nine percent, considering both the recipient jurisdiction's taxation and any withholding tax imposed. Residence jurisdictions must provide corresponding foreign tax credits to prevent double taxation. These coordinated mechanisms ensure that the STTR achieves its revenue protection objectives without creating excessive compliance burdens or double taxation.

### 6. Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT)

#### 6.1. Purpose and Priority

The Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax enables jurisdictions to retain Pillar Two top-up tax revenues domestically rather than allowing them to flow to other jurisdictions through the IIR or UTPR. A QDMTT imposes domestic top-up tax on low-taxed profits of constituent entities located in the implementing jurisdiction, calculated using the same rules that would apply under the IIR. By imposing this domestic top-up tax, the jurisdiction satisfies Pillar Two minimum taxation requirements and prevents other jurisdictions from collecting top-up tax on the same profits.

The QDMTT occupies first priority in the Pillar Two rule ordering structure. When a jurisdiction imposes a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, that tax is treated as reducing or eliminating top-up tax that would otherwise be collected through the IIR or UTPR. This prioritization creates strong incentives for jurisdictions to adopt QDMTTs, as doing so allows them to retain revenues that would otherwise flow to parent jurisdictions through the IIR or to peer jurisdictions through the UTPR.

Consider a jurisdiction with a nominal corporate tax rate of twelve percent that produces an effective tax rate below fifteen percent due to accelerated depreciation and other incentives. Without a QDMTT, top-up tax on under-taxed profits of entities in this jurisdiction would be collected by parent jurisdictions through the IIR. By implementing a QDMTT, the jurisdiction collects this top-up tax domestically, retaining revenues while maintaining its existing tax incentives for genuine economic activity. *(examined in June 2025)*

#### 6.2. Revenue Retention Mechanism

The revenue retention mechanism operates through the interaction between the QDMTT and the IIR ETR calculation. When calculating the effective tax rate for a jurisdiction under the IIR, covered taxes include both regular corporate income taxes and any QDMTT imposed by that jurisdiction. If the combined regular tax and QDMTT bring the ETR to fifteen percent, no top-up tax is allocated to parent entities under the IIR, effectively allowing the implementing jurisdiction to retain all revenues.

Implementation of QDMTTs has proceeded rapidly among jurisdictions seeking to retain Pillar Two revenues. By early 2025, twenty-two of the twenty-seven European Union member states had implemented QDMTTs alongside their IIR obligations. Major economies including the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and Switzerland have similarly adopted or announced QDMTTs. This widespread adoption reflects the compelling revenue retention incentive created by the first-priority rule ordering.

The QDMTT framework requires that domestic top-up taxes be calculated using methodologies and definitions consistent with the IIR to qualify for priority treatment. Jurisdictions cannot impose alternative minimum taxes using different income or tax calculations and claim QDMTT priority. This consistency requirement ensures that QDMTTs achieve the same policy objectives as the IIR while allowing revenue retention. The OECD provides detailed guidance on QDMTT design to facilitate compliant implementation and prevent disputes about whether specific domestic provisions qualify.

### 7. Substance-Based Income Exclusion and Safe Harbours

#### 7.1. Payroll and Tangible Asset Carve-Outs

The substance-based income exclusion acknowledges that Pillar Two should not penalize genuine economic activity and that jurisdictions should retain flexibility to compete for real investment through tax incentives. The exclusion operates by reducing GloBE income subject to top-up tax by amounts related to substantive activities, measured through payroll costs and tangible asset values. This carve-out ensures that tax incentives for activities involving significant employment and capital investment remain partially effective.

The payroll carve-out equals a specified percentage of eligible payroll costs, including salaries, wages, and other employee compensation expenses. For the transition period from 2024 through 2032, the payroll carve-out begins at ten percent of eligible payroll and declines progressively to five percent by 2033, where it remains permanently. This phase-down reduces the carve-out magnitude over time while providing transitional relief for jurisdictions and taxpayers adjusting to the minimum tax framework.

The tangible asset carve-out equals a specified percentage of the carrying value of eligible tangible assets, including property, plant, equipment, and natural resources used in business operations. The tangible asset percentage similarly begins at eight percent in 2024 and declines to five percent by 2033. Intangible assets, financial assets, and assets held for investment rather than operational use are excluded from the calculation, ensuring the carve-out benefits productive business activities rather than passive income generation.

Consider a constituent entity with one hundred million euros GloBE income, twenty million euros eligible payroll, and one hundred million euros eligible tangible assets. In 2024, the substance-based income exclusion equals two million euros from the payroll carve-out plus eight million euros from the tangible asset carve-out, totaling ten million euros. This exclusion reduces excess profits subject to top-up tax from one hundred million euros to approximately ninety million euros, meaningfully reducing Pillar Two obligations while preserving incentives for employment and capital investment.

#### 7.2. Transitional and Permanent Safe Harbours

Pillar Two includes safe harbour provisions that provide compliance relief and reduce top-up tax calculations for jurisdictions and taxpayers meeting specified criteria. The Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbour, applicable through 2026, allows taxpayers to demonstrate that they have no top-up tax liability in a jurisdiction based on simplified calculations using country-by-country reporting data rather than conducting full GloBE calculations. This transitional relief reduces initial compliance burdens while implementation proceeds.

The permanent safe harbours include the de minimis safe harbour and the simplified ETR test. The de minimis safe harbour excludes jurisdictions where a group has less than one million euros in revenues and less than fifty thousand euros in profits, recognizing that full GloBE calculations would be disproportionately burdensome for minimal revenue impact. The simplified ETR test allows taxpayers to demonstrate through simplified calculations that a jurisdiction's effective tax rate exceeds the minimum rate, avoiding detailed GloBE calculations where clearly unnecessary.

These safe harbour mechanisms reduce compliance costs and administrative burdens while maintaining Pillar Two's core revenue protection objectives. By providing simplified demonstrations of compliance in low-risk situations, the safe harbours focus detailed compliance efforts on jurisdictions and arrangements where under-taxation concerns are most pronounced. *(discussed in June 2023)*

### 8. Implementation Status and Challenges

Global implementation of Pillar Two has proceeded rapidly since the political agreement in October 2021. By early 2025, over fifty jurisdictions have implemented or committed to implementing the IIR, representing the substantial majority of headquarters locations for in-scope multinational groups. The European Union adopted the Pillar Two Directive in December 2022, requiring member states to implement the IIR by December 31, 2023 and the UTPR by December 31, 2024. Major economies including the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Australia have enacted Pillar Two implementation.

The United States represents the most significant gap in Pillar Two implementation. The existing Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime shares conceptual similarities with the IIR but differs in calculation methodology, rate structure, and scope. These differences mean that GILTI does not fully satisfy IIR requirements, creating complex interactions when US-parented groups operate in jurisdictions that have implemented the UTPR. In June 2025, the G7 countries reached agreement on a side-by-side framework allowing GILTI and the IIR to coexist while minimizing double taxation and compliance burdens.

Implementation challenges include technical complexity, coordination across multiple domestic legal systems, and interactions with existing tax incentive regimes. Taxpayers face substantial compliance burdens in collecting necessary data, performing ETR calculations for all jurisdictions of operation, and navigating interactions between domestic tax obligations and Pillar Two top-up taxes. These challenges necessitate continued refinement of technical guidance and coordination mechanisms to ensure smooth operation of the global minimum tax framework.
