# Chapter 4.2. Artificial Intelligence and Taxation

## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence transforms both tax administration and the substantive rules governing international taxation. Tax authorities increasingly deploy machine learning algorithms to detect non-compliance and automate processing, while multinational enterprises utilise AI systems that create novel challenges for transfer pricing, permanent establishment, and income characterisation rules developed before such technology existed.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Tax Administration 2025 report indicates that 72 percent of surveyed tax administrations now use artificial intelligence, with 29 of 38 OECD members having deployed AI systems by 2024. This adoption rate jumped from 47 percent in 2024 to 84 percent in 2025 across finance and tax functions generally. The rapid deployment creates both opportunities for improved compliance and risks regarding taxpayer rights and algorithmic bias.

## 2. AI in Tax Administration

### 2.1. Tax Authority Deployment

Tax administrations worldwide employ AI primarily for compliance and fraud detection. The OECD characterises tax administration as a particularly demanding environment for AI implementation due to the sensitivity of personal data and taxpayer rights considerations. Seventy-nine percent of AI-using administrations deploy the technology specifically for detecting tax evasion and fraud.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses AI to select representative audit samples and identify returns likely to contain errors or owe additional taxes. Computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics support fraud detection efforts. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2024 that the IRS prioritises tax returns for audit using AI, particularly for partnerships, corporations, and refundable credit claimants.

The United Kingdom His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) publicly acknowledged in August 2025 that it uses AI to monitor taxpayers' social media posts in criminal tax investigations. These tools compare online activity against financial data, tax returns, and spending habits. Posts showing luxury holidays or high-end purchases inconsistent with declared income may trigger investigation. Following an eighteen-month Freedom of Information Act campaign, a First-Tier Tribunal ordered HMRC to disclose information about its AI use by September 2025. The technology forms part of efforts to address the United Kingdom's forty-six point eight billion pound tax gap.

France uses AI to analyse aerial imagery, detecting undeclared swimming pools and property extensions by comparing imagery with taxpayer declarations. Austria's Predictive Analytics Competence Centre analyses millions of tax cases annually, flagging non-compliance and guiding both retrospective and real-time audits. Singapore's Inland Revenue Authority upgraded its Government Virtual Intelligent Chat Assistant with large language model capabilities in 2023, handling approximately seventy thousand transactional queries in the 2024 fiscal year.

### 2.2. Governance and Oversight

Quality assurance practices vary significantly across administrations. Over 80 percent conduct reviews of AI input information, testing of AI responses, and monitoring of outputs. However, only 50 percent review AI source code, creating potential accountability gaps. The OECD Forum on Tax Administration is piloting a governance framework for AI deployment, with findings scheduled for publication in 2026.

Australia implemented a Policy for Responsible Use of AI in Government from September 2024, requiring designated accountable officials by November 2024 and AI transparency statements by February 2025. The Dutch childcare benefits scandal illustrated risks of automated tax administration, including violations of fundamental rights and discrimination from algorithmic decision-making.

## 3. Transfer Pricing Challenges

### 3.1. AI as Intangible Asset

Artificial intelligence systems constitute intangible assets requiring careful transfer pricing analysis. The Development, Enhancement, Maintenance, Protection, and Exploitation framework determines profit allocation for AI-related intangibles. Under OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, profits cannot be attributed solely to legal ownership. Returns from intangibles must be allocated to the group entity performing important functions contributing to development, enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation.

AI creates distinctive challenges for this framework. Self-learning models blur the distinction between enhancement and maintenance functions. Fine-tuning a model constitutes enhancement, while keeping it relevant constitutes maintenance, but the continuous learning process makes these categories difficult to separate. Academic guidance published in 2025 suggests separating static intangibles such as codebases and architecture from dynamic capabilities including self-learning models and algorithm refinement.

Fragmented development activities across multiple jurisdictions complicate analysis further. AI development typically involves data collection, algorithm design, training, testing, and deployment occurring in different locations. Identifying which functions create the most value and allocating returns accordingly requires detailed functional analysis that traditional approaches may not adequately capture.

### 3.2. Valuation Difficulties

No single valuation method applies universally to AI algorithms. Valuation depends on functional analysis of business processes and how the transferred intangible interacts with other functions, assets, and risks comprising the global business. Traditional comparable uncontrolled transactions prove difficult to identify for unique AI systems, as each system may have distinctive characteristics affecting value.

Price volatility and rapid technological change compound these difficulties. An AI system's value may change substantially between development and deployment, or between different versions. Documentation must address which version is being valued and whether subsequent improvements constitute separate intangibles or enhancements to existing ones.

Country-by-country reporting under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 13 requires reconciliation of local financials with Master File and Country-by-Country Report data. Intercompany charges including management fees, royalties, and cost-sharing contributions must be benchmarked and justified across jurisdictions. AI tools themselves increasingly assist with this benchmarking, cross-referencing intellectual property ownership, cost allocation, and contract terms.

## 4. Nexus and Permanent Establishment Issues

### 4.1. Automated Presence

Traditional permanent establishment concepts based on physical presence apply awkwardly to AI-driven business models. Automated digital services may generate substantial revenue in jurisdictions without physical infrastructure. The question whether automated decision-making systems create taxable presence remains unsettled in international tax law.

The OECD published significant updates to Article 5 of the Model Tax Convention in November 2025, the first substantial permanent establishment changes in nearly a decade. While focused primarily on remote working arrangements, establishing a 50 percent working time threshold with commercial reason test, the update does not specifically address AI-created presence. Tax experts continue exploring virtual permanent establishment frameworks for digital world taxation.

Under Article 12B of the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention, adopted in April 2021, income from automated digital services may be subject to source taxation. The article covers services delivered through standardised processes without meaningful customisation or human intervention for individual transactions. However, as of late 2025, no bilateral tax treaties had incorporated Article 12B, limiting its practical application.

### 4.2. Digital Services Taxes

Several jurisdictions have implemented or considered digital services taxes affecting AI-driven businesses. India operated an equalisation levy on e-commerce transactions at 2 percent before repealing it in August 2024, and repealed its 6 percent online advertising levy in April 2025. India's significant economic presence framework triggers nexus at revenue thresholds of twenty million rupees or user engagement criteria of three hundred thousand users.

Classification of AI services as tangible personal property versus services significantly impacts tax obligations. Inconsistent treatment across jurisdictions complicates compliance for multinational enterprises. Some states and localities in the United States are exploring AI-specific taxes or fees, with discussions about taxing AI usage or its impact on local labour markets.

## 5. Income Characterisation

### 5.1. Royalties Versus Business Profits

The characterisation of AI-related payments under tax treaties creates significant uncertainty. Under Article 12 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, royalties arising in a contracting state and beneficially owned by a resident of the other state are taxable only in the residence state. However, whether payments for AI services constitute royalties, technical service fees under Article 12A of the United Nations Model, or business profits under Article 7 requires detailed analysis.

Digital platforms often provide combinations of automated and human-delivered services within single subscriptions. Unbundling payments to determine coverage under different treaty articles requires analysis not aligned with commercial pricing structures. A service characterised as automated in one jurisdiction might be viewed as requiring significant human involvement in another, creating persistent differences across treaty networks.

### 5.2. Australian Software Ruling Controversy

The Australian Taxation Office Draft Ruling TR 2024/D1 illustrates these characterisation difficulties. The ruling addresses when amounts paid under software arrangements constitute royalties subject to withholding tax. The United States Treasury expressed concern about interpretation inconsistencies, arguing that under its approach, income under similar contractual arrangements would constitute business profits rather than royalties, consistent with OECD Model Commentary.

The Australian Taxation Office suspended finalisation of the ruling pending High Court of Australia judgment in Pepsi litigation, with cases involving Pepsi, Oracle, and Coca-Cola progressing through courts. The High Court heard the Australian Taxation Office appeal in the Pepsi matter in April 2025. These disputes may resolve characterisation questions with implications beyond Australia.

Mutual agreement procedure statistics highlight structural challenges: the average case requires thirty-two months to close, with nearly 24 percent exceeding four years. These delays reflect inadequate processing of twenty-first century compliance demands through traditional workflows.

The treaty network has expanded significantly, reaching almost four thousand eight hundred fifty treaties in 2024 compared to only one thousand eight in 1990. However, this expansion has levelled off recently, with only 294 additional treaties during 2017-2024. Despite post-BEPS reforms, royalty payments remain central to profit-shifting strategies, with intra-group service fees and royalty payments continuing to shift profits and erode tax bases.

## 6. European Union AI Act

Regulation 2024/1689, published in the European Union (EU) Official Journal on 12 July 2024, creates the first comprehensive horizontal legal framework for AI systems regulation. The regulation entered into force on 1 August 2024 with phased enforcement: prohibitions on certain AI systems from 2 February 2025, obligations on general purpose AI model providers from 2 August 2025, and remaining obligations from 2 August 2026. Maximum penalties reach thirty-five million euros or 7 percent of worldwide annual turnover.

Tax administrations employing AI for risk detection and legal analysis must consider implications of high-risk AI system classification. The regulation introduces rights to human intervention for high-risk AI systems, interacting with existing General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provisions that principally ban fully automated decisions while permitting exceptions with appropriate safeguards.

The European Commission established an AI Office in early 2024 to promote trustworthy AI development while mitigating associated risks. The January 2025 IBFD report on Artificial Intelligence Usage in EU Tax Administration provides comprehensive analysis of these regulatory implications for tax authorities.

Ethical concerns extend beyond regulatory compliance. Algorithmic bias can perpetuate and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair targeting of certain taxpayers or systematic overlooking of certain behaviours. Tax authorities handling large volumes of sensitive personal data must invest in cybersecurity while ensuring correct handling and prevention of misuse. The balance between administrative efficiency and taxpayer protection remains contested.

## 7. Conclusion

Artificial intelligence creates both administrative opportunities and substantive challenges for international taxation. Tax authorities increasingly rely on AI for compliance while the rules governing AI-generated income and AI-driven businesses remain unsettled. Transfer pricing frameworks developed for traditional intangibles apply imperfectly to self-learning systems with fragmented development across jurisdictions. Permanent establishment and income characterisation rules drafted before digital commerce struggle with automated services lacking physical presence.

The coming years will likely bring targeted guidance on AI-specific transfer pricing issues, broader adoption of digital service taxation, and resolution of characterisation disputes currently before courts in multiple jurisdictions. Significant uncertainty remains regarding the international tax treatment of artificial intelligence.
