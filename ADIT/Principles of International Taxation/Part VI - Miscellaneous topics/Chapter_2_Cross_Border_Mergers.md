# Chapter 2. Cross-Border Mergers: Examination of Issues and Solutions

## 1. Introduction

Cross-border mergers present distinctive tax challenges that domestic reorganisations do not encounter. When companies in different jurisdictions combine, each country's tax system applies its own rules to the transaction, frequently producing conflicting results. The acquiring company's jurisdiction may expect tax neutrality to encourage business combinations, while the target company's jurisdiction seeks to tax gains before assets leave its taxing reach. Shareholders face similar tensions between immediate recognition and deferral.

These conflicts arise because tax systems were designed primarily for domestic transactions. International mergers force interaction between regimes built on different premises regarding gain recognition, loss utilisation, and asset valuation.

## 2. Fundamental Tax Issues

### 2.1. Gain Recognition and Exit Taxation

The most significant issue in cross-border mergers concerns when and whether gains are recognised for tax purposes. When a target company's assets transfer to an acquiring company in another jurisdiction, the target's home country faces a choice: permit the transfer without immediate taxation, or impose an exit tax to capture unrealised appreciation before assets leave its tax base.

The European Union (EU) Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), implemented from 1 January 2020, codifies exit taxation principles across Member States. Article 5 requires taxation at market value when assets, tax residence, or permanent establishments transfer cross-border. However, the Court of Justice of the European Union has constrained these rules, requiring Member States to offer deferral until actual realisation for transfers within the EU and European Economic Area. Immediate taxation without deferral options would violate freedom of establishment under Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Country practices vary considerably. Germany imposes exit taxes up to 26.375 percent but offers seven equal annual instalments for qualifying transfers. The Netherlands applies a progressive two-bracket system from 2024, taxing substantial interests at 24.5 percent on the first sixty-seven thousand euros and 31 percent thereafter, with automatic interest-free deferral for transfers within the EU. France applies progressive rates but cancels exit tax liability entirely if the taxpayer returns within two years for EU relocations or five years for other jurisdictions, reduced from fifteen years by 2019 reforms. Norway introduced twelve-year interest-free instalment options in 2024. Countries including Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden impose no exit tax, though Sweden maintains a ten-year clawback rule.

### 2.2. Loss Carryforwards

Cross-border mergers create particular difficulties for accumulated tax losses. Domestic reorganisation rules typically permit loss carryforwards to transfer to acquiring companies under specified conditions. Cross-border transactions frequently sever this continuity.

The EU Merger Directive explicitly does not require Member States to permit loss carryforwards of transferring companies to pass to acquiring companies. Unutilised losses may simply disappear when the target company ceases to exist in its home jurisdiction. Additionally, the acquisition itself may trigger change-of-control provisions that limit or eliminate the acquiring company's ability to use its own pre-existing losses.

Loss carryforward periods differ substantially across jurisdictions. Twenty of thirty-five European countries permit unlimited carryforward periods. Luxembourg offers the most generous limited period at seventeen years. Five countries—Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, and Greece—restrict carryforwards to five years. Romania reduced its carryforward period from seven to five years in 2024 while adding a 70 percent of taxable income deductibility limit. The United States (US) permits unlimited carryforwards but limits annual deductions to 80 percent of taxable income.

### 2.3. Step-Up in Basis

Acquiring companies generally prefer asset purchases over share purchases because asset acquisitions provide a step-up in tax basis to fair market value. Higher basis produces greater depreciation and amortisation deductions, reducing future tax liabilities. Goodwill acquired in asset purchases amortises over fifteen years under US rules as a Section 197 intangible.

Cross-border mergers complicate step-up analysis. The target's jurisdiction may impose immediate taxation on the deemed disposition required to generate the step-up, creating double taxation when the acquirer subsequently claims deductions. Pillar Two global minimum tax rules do not provide step-up under transitional provisions, identified as a significant issue in 2024 implementation discussions. Transfer pricing scrutiny intensifies for step-up transactions as tax authorities examine whether valuations reflect arm's length standards.

## 3. European Union Merger Directive

Council Directive 2009/133/EC establishes a common system of taxation for cross-border reorganisations involving companies in two or more Member States. The Directive covers mergers, divisions, partial divisions, transfers of assets, and exchanges of shares. It also addresses transfers of registered offices for European Companies and European Cooperative Societies.

### 3.1. Tax Neutrality Provisions

The Directive's core principle provides tax deferral rather than immediate exemption. When a company transfers assets to another company in exchange for securities, the transferring company's gains on those assets are not immediately taxable. Instead, the receiving company takes over the assets at their existing tax values, preserving the deferred gain for future recognition when the receiving company eventually disposes of the assets.

Shareholder-level treatment mirrors this approach. When shareholders exchange shares in the target company for shares in the acquiring company, no gain or loss arises at the exchange. The shareholders take their new shares with the same tax basis as their old shares, deferring recognition until ultimate disposal.

### 3.2. Conditions and Limitations

The Directive applies only to companies that are resident in Member States and subject to corporate taxation. It requires that the receiving company receive assets constituting a permanent establishment in the transferring company's Member State, or that the transferred assets not be connected with a permanent establishment.

Article 15 permits Member States to refuse Directive benefits where the principal objective or one of the principal objectives of the transaction is tax evasion or avoidance. This anti-abuse provision allows Member States to deny deferral for transactions lacking genuine commercial reasons, where the merger appears designed primarily to obtain tax advantages.

The Directive does not harmonise all aspects of merger taxation. Member States retain discretion over loss carryforward treatment and may impose additional conditions beyond the Directive's requirements. Implementation varies across Member States, creating complexity for transactions involving multiple jurisdictions.

## 4. United States Reorganisation Rules

### 4.1. Section 368 Framework

The Internal Revenue Code Section 368 defines seven types of tax-free reorganisations. Type A covers statutory mergers and consolidations under state law. Type B involves stock-for-stock exchanges where the acquiring company obtains at least 80 percent control using solely voting stock. Type C permits stock-for-asset exchanges where substantially all assets transfer in exchange for voting stock.

Three judicially-developed requirements supplement the statutory rules. The business purpose doctrine requires that reorganisations serve legitimate business purposes beyond tax avoidance. Continuity of interest requires that target shareholders maintain a continuing equity stake in the combined enterprise. Continuity of business enterprise requires that the acquiring company continue the target's historic business or use a significant portion of the target's historic business assets.

### 4.2. Section 367 Outbound Rules

Section 367 imposes special rules when appreciated property transfers to foreign corporations. The general rule requires US persons transferring property to foreign corporations in otherwise tax-free exchanges to recognise gain as if the property were sold at fair market value. This toll charge prevents appreciated assets from leaving US taxing jurisdiction without recognition.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the active trade or business exception that previously permitted some outbound transfers without gain recognition. Shareholders owning 5 percent or more may still defer recognition by entering into Gain Recognition Agreements, which trigger the deferred gain if specified events occur during the agreement period.

Final regulations issued in July 2024 addressed triangular reorganisations and inbound nonrecognition transactions under Section 367(b). These regulations target Killer B transactions that previously permitted taxpayers to repatriate earnings without dividend treatment through carefully structured triangular acquisitions.

## 5. United Kingdom Substantial Shareholding Exemption

The United Kingdom (UK) Substantial Shareholding Exemption provides complete exemption from corporation tax on gains from qualifying share disposals. Unlike deferral regimes, the exemption permanently eliminates tax on qualifying gains.

Qualification requires a substantial shareholding—at least 10 percent of ordinary share capital held continuously for twelve months within the two years preceding disposal. The selling company must also meet the investing company requirement, and the target must be a trading company or holding company of a trading group. Non-trading activities must not exceed 20 percent measured by turnover, assets, expenditure, or employee time.

The exemption applies automatically when conditions are satisfied, requiring no election. However, losses on disposals that would qualify for the exemption are not allowable. The Qualifying Institutional Investor exception relaxes certain requirements where institutional investors own 25 percent or more of the seller and the acquisition cost exceeded twenty million pounds.

The 2023 decision in M Group Holdings Ltd v HMRC confirmed strict application of the twelve-month holding period. The tribunal rejected arguments that ownership of the underlying trade before group formation should count toward the period.

## 6. OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines

Chapter IX of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines addresses business restructurings, including cross-border mergers. The Guidelines define business restructurings as cross-border reorganisations of commercial or financial relations between associated enterprises, including termination or substantial renegotiation of existing arrangements.

### 6.1. Arm's Length Compensation

The Guidelines require that compensation for restructuring transactions reflect what independent parties would agree under comparable circumstances. This includes compensation for any transfer of value, such as when profit potential reallocates from one entity to another, or when something of value transfers between related parties.

Accurate delineation of the actual transaction is essential. Tax authorities must examine the economically relevant characteristics of controlled transactions, including contractual terms, functions performed, assets used, risks assumed, and economic circumstances. The analysis must consider whether the restructuring would occur between independent parties and, if so, on what terms.

### 6.2. Documentation Requirements

Business restructuring transactions require comprehensive transfer pricing documentation. Germany imposes a six-month contemporaneous preparation deadline with thirty-day delivery requirements when authorities request documentation. The EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6) requires mandatory reporting for high-value intangible transfers and cross-border arrangements causing significant reductions in earnings before interest and tax.

## 7. Recent Developments

The global minimum tax under Pillar Two, effective from January 2024 in most EU Member States, affects cross-border merger structuring. The 15 percent minimum rate reduces incentives for mergers motivated primarily by access to low-tax jurisdictions. Companies must integrate Pillar Two analysis from transaction inception, considering top-up tax exposure and qualified domestic minimum top-up tax elections.

Digital services taxes in countries including France, the UK, Italy, and Spain create additional complications for technology company mergers. Canada enacted digital services tax legislation in 2024 despite the OECD moratorium. The US Trade Representative renewed Section 301 investigation authority in February 2025, potentially affecting merger planning for companies with significant digital revenues.

## 8. Conclusion

Cross-border mergers require careful navigation of multiple tax systems with differing approaches to gain recognition, loss utilisation, and restructuring compensation. The EU Merger Directive provides a framework for tax-neutral reorganisations within Member States, but significant limitations remain regarding loss carryforwards and anti-abuse provisions. US rules impose toll charges on outbound transfers while permitting domestic reorganisation treatment for qualifying transactions. The UK offers complete exemption rather than deferral for substantial shareholding disposals.

Pillar Two global minimum tax implementation adds complexity to cross-border merger planning from 2024, affecting decisions about transaction structure, jurisdiction selection, and timing. Transfer pricing documentation requirements continue intensifying, with tax authorities increasingly sophisticated in challenging valuations for restructuring transactions. Successful cross-border mergers require integrated planning addressing these overlapping frameworks from transaction inception.
