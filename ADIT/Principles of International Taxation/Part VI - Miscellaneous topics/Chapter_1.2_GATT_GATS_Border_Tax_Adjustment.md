# Chapter 1.2. Indirect Taxes and International Taxation: GATT and GATS Rules and Border Tax Adjustment

## 1. Introduction to Trade Law and Taxation

The destination principle for indirect taxes, examined in Chapter 1.1, relies on border tax adjustments to achieve trade neutrality. Exports leave the origin country free of consumption tax, while imports bear the destination country's tax on the same basis as domestic production. This mechanism depends on international trade law permitting such adjustments at borders without constituting prohibited trade barriers.

The World Trade Organization framework, built upon the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), establishes the legal boundaries for border tax adjustments. Understanding these rules explains why the destination principle operates successfully for value added taxes and goods and services taxes, while similar adjustments for income taxes remain impermissible. The distinction between adjustable and non-adjustable taxes carries significant implications for tax policy design and international competitiveness.

## 2. GATT Framework for Border Tax Adjustments

### 2.1. Article III National Treatment

GATT Article III establishes the national treatment principle requiring that internal taxes and regulations treat imported products no less favourably than like domestic products. Article III:2 specifically provides that products imported from any contracting party shall not be subject to internal taxes in excess of those applied to like domestic products.

The national treatment obligation prevents countries from using internal taxation to protect domestic industries from import competition. A country may not levy higher consumption taxes on imported goods than on domestically produced equivalents. However, the provision implicitly permits border tax adjustments that equalise the tax burden between imported and domestic products—the mechanism underlying destination-based consumption taxation.

The interpretation of "like products" under Article III has generated substantial jurisprudence. Products need not be identical to qualify as "like"—the analysis considers physical characteristics, end uses, consumer preferences, and tariff classifications. Products that are directly competitive or substitutable may also fall within the national treatment discipline, though with different legal consequences. This interpretation affects how countries may structure consumption taxes across product categories.

### 2.2. The 1970 Working Party Report

The GATT Working Party on Border Tax Adjustments produced a foundational report in December 1970 that continues to govern the distinction between adjustable and non-adjustable taxes. The report addressed which taxes countries may legitimately adjust at borders when goods cross international frontiers.

The Working Party concluded that taxes directly levied on products were eligible for tax adjustment. The report identified specific examples of adjustable taxes: excise duties, sales taxes, cascade taxes, and value added taxes. These taxes attach to products rather than to producers, and their adjustment at borders ensures the destination principle operates effectively.

Conversely, the Working Party concluded that taxes not directly levied on products were not eligible for border adjustment. Social security charges and payroll taxes fell into this category. The report noted that corporate income taxes and other direct taxes on producers similarly could not be adjusted at borders without constituting prohibited subsidies or discriminatory charges.

The theoretical justification for this distinction rested on assumptions about tax incidence. Indirect taxes were assumed to be fully shifted forward into product prices, making border adjustment appropriate to achieve competitive neutrality. Direct taxes were assumed to be absorbed by factors of production rather than embedded in product prices, rendering border adjustment both unnecessary and trade-distorting.

## 3. The Direct/Indirect Tax Distinction

### 3.1. Taxes Eligible for Border Adjustment

Under established GATT practice, border tax adjustments are permitted for taxes imposed on products at any stage of production or distribution. Value added taxes represent the paradigm case—exports receive zero-rating with refund of input taxes, while imports bear tax at the destination country's rate. Excise duties on specific products such as alcohol, tobacco, and fuel similarly qualify for border adjustment.

The eligibility extends to any tax that attaches to the product itself rather than to the enterprise producing it. Cascade taxes—levied cumulatively at each transaction stage—and single-stage sales taxes both fall within the adjustable category. The key criterion is whether the tax burden can be identified as resting on the product crossing the border.

### 3.2. Taxes Not Eligible for Border Adjustment

Corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and social security contributions cannot be adjusted at borders under WTO rules. A country may not rebate its corporate taxes on exports or impose equivalent charges on imports, as such measures would constitute prohibited export subsidies or discriminatory import charges respectively.

This limitation has generated persistent controversy. The 1970 Working Party acknowledged that the assumption underlying the distinction—that indirect taxes are fully shifted while direct taxes are not—was "full of difficulty and of a very complex nature." Some delegations expressed concern that the rules favour countries relying heavily on consumption taxes and disadvantage those depending primarily on income taxation.

The practical consequence is that countries with high value added tax rates can fully rebate those taxes on exports without WTO challenge, while countries funding government through corporate taxation cannot provide equivalent relief. This asymmetry has influenced tax policy design in some jurisdictions and generated proposals for reform that have not achieved consensus.

## 4. GATS and Services Taxation

### 4.1. Article XIV General Exceptions

The General Agreement on Trade in Services applies the national treatment and most-favoured-nation principles to cross-border services. GATS Article XIV provides general exceptions permitting measures that would otherwise violate these obligations, including specific provisions for taxation.

The exceptions permit measures aimed at ensuring equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes. Countries may apply different treatment to non-resident service suppliers reflecting their different tax position, impose measures to ensure tax collection from non-residents, and take steps to prevent tax avoidance or evasion. These exceptions recognise that tax administration requires distinguishing between residents and non-residents in ways that pure trade liberalisation would prohibit.

The Article XIV exceptions operate subject to a chapeau requirement that measures not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade in services. Countries invoking tax exceptions must demonstrate that their measures genuinely serve tax policy objectives rather than protecting domestic service providers from foreign competition.

### 4.2. Application to Digital Services

The distinction between goods and services under WTO law creates uncertainty for digital economy taxation. Digital services cross borders without physical customs controls, and their taxation raises questions about whether GATT or GATS disciplines apply. The GATS framework for services taxation differs from GATT rules for goods, potentially affecting how countries may impose and collect taxes on cross-border digital supplies.

Countries have increasingly imposed digital services taxes targeting revenue from specified digital activities within their territories. These taxes raise questions about consistency with GATS national treatment and most-favoured-nation obligations, particularly where they apply predominantly to foreign suppliers. The exceptions for direct taxation measures may provide justification, though the novel character of these taxes leaves their WTO status uncertain.

## 5. Key WTO Disputes

### 5.1. United States – Foreign Sales Corporation

The Foreign Sales Corporation dispute remains the most significant WTO case addressing the intersection of tax policy and trade law. The European Communities challenged United States tax provisions that permitted American exporters to shelter a portion of export income from federal taxation through specially structured foreign sales corporations.

The WTO panel found in March 2000 that the FSC provisions constituted prohibited export subsidies under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The Appellate Body affirmed this finding, concluding that the tax benefit provided to exporters but not to domestic sellers represented a subsidy contingent on export performance.

The United States enacted replacement legislation—the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000—but the European Communities successfully challenged this measure as well. After continued non-compliance, the WTO authorised retaliation in August 2002, permitting the European Communities to impose over four billion dollars in countermeasures. This authorisation represented the largest retaliation ever approved in WTO history.

The FSC case illustrated that border-adjustment-style benefits for income taxes violate WTO subsidy rules. Unlike the destination principle for consumption taxes, which GATT permits, attempts to provide equivalent treatment for income taxes cross the line into prohibited subsidies. The United States ultimately repealed the offending provisions in May 2006.

### 5.2. Japan – Alcoholic Beverages

The Japan Alcoholic Beverages dispute established foundational principles for analysing discriminatory taxation under GATT Article III. The European Communities, Canada, and United States challenged Japanese liquor tax law that imposed substantially lower rates on shochu—a traditional Japanese spirit—than on imported whisky, cognac, and other spirits.

The panel found in July 1996 that shochu and vodka constituted "like products" and that Japan's differential taxation violated Article III:2. The Appellate Body in October 1996 affirmed the violation while clarifying the legal framework for product comparison. Importantly, the case established that origin-neutral tax laws can still violate national treatment if they disproportionately burden imported products.

The case demonstrated that WTO disciplines constrain not only explicit discrimination but also measures that achieve discriminatory effects through product classifications. Countries designing consumption tax structures must consider whether rate differentials across product categories might disadvantage imports relative to domestic production.

## 6. Contemporary Applications

### 6.1. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms

The European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism represents the most significant contemporary test of border tax adjustment principles. The mechanism requires importers of specified carbon-intensive products to purchase certificates reflecting the carbon emissions embedded in production, equalising the carbon cost borne by domestic producers under the EU Emissions Trading System.

The transitional phase began on 1 October 2023, with importers required to report embedded emissions without financial payment. The definitive regime commences on 1 January 2026, when importers must surrender certificates priced according to EU carbon allowance values. Products covered include cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen.

The mechanism's WTO compatibility remains contested. The EU argues that CBAM constitutes a permissible border tax adjustment ensuring equivalent treatment of domestic and imported products. Critics contend that carbon pricing does not fit traditional categories of adjustable taxes and that the mechanism discriminates against countries employing different climate policy approaches.

The GATT Article XX exceptions for measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, or relating to conservation of exhaustible natural resources, may provide justification. Whether carbon border adjustments satisfy the chapeau requirement of non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory application will likely depend on specific design features, particularly whether the mechanism adequately credits alternative climate policies in exporting countries.

### 6.2. Digital Services Taxes

Digital services taxes targeting revenue from specified digital activities have proliferated despite concerns about WTO compatibility. Countries including France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Austria, and Turkey have implemented such taxes, with Canada enacting legislation in 2024 despite the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development moratorium on new measures.

The United States Trade Representative conducted Section 301 investigations finding that several digital services tax regimes discriminate against American companies. Investigations concluded in June 2021 identified measures in Austria, India, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom as actionable. President Trump renewed investigation authority in February 2025, directing consideration of retaliatory tariffs against countries maintaining these taxes.

The WTO compatibility of digital services taxes remains formally untested, as no dispute has proceeded to panel decision. The dysfunctional state of WTO dispute settlement—the Appellate Body has been non-operational since December 2019 after the United States blocked appointments—means that definitive resolution through litigation appears unlikely in the near term. Countries continue to navigate this uncertainty through bilateral negotiations rather than multilateral adjudication (covered in December 2024).
