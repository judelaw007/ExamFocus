# Chapter 4.1. Digital Currencies and Blockchain

## 1. Introduction

Digital currencies and blockchain technology present novel challenges for international taxation. Cryptocurrencies operate across borders without central authorities, making traditional concepts of source, residence, and income characterisation difficult to apply. The decentralised nature of blockchain networks means that mining, trading, and validation activities may occur simultaneously in multiple jurisdictions, creating potential for both double taxation and double non-taxation.

Tax authorities worldwide have developed approaches to these challenges, though significant variation exists in how different jurisdictions classify and tax digital assets. The international community has responded through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, establishing automatic exchange of information for cryptocurrency transactions.

## 2. Tax Classification of Digital Assets

### 2.1. Property Versus Currency Treatment

The fundamental question in cryptocurrency taxation concerns whether digital assets constitute property, currency, or some other category. This classification determines applicable tax rates, recognition timing, and reporting requirements. The distinction carries significant practical consequences: property treatment triggers capital gains taxation on disposal, while currency treatment might permit tax-free exchanges between different denominations.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) established in Notice 2014-21 that virtual currencies constitute property for federal tax purposes, not currency. This classification means that disposals trigger capital gains or losses, with short-term rates of 10 to 37 percent for assets held one year or less and long-term rates of 0 to 20 percent for assets held longer. The property classification applies even where foreign jurisdictions treat Bitcoin as legal tender, as confirmed by Notice 2023-34. This position reflects the IRS view that cryptocurrencies lack the stability and widespread acceptance necessary for currency treatment.

The United Kingdom Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) similarly treats cryptocurrencies as property rather than currency. Capital gains tax applies at rates of 18 to 24 percent following the October 2024 rate increase. The annual exemption reduced to three thousand pounds for the 2024-2025 tax year, significantly lower than the six thousand pound exemption available in the prior year. Share pooling rules apply for calculating cost basis, with same-day and thirty-day bed-and-breakfasting rules preventing artificial loss realisation through repurchase of disposed assets.

Germany classifies cryptocurrencies as private money, subjecting them to private sales transaction taxation. Notably, disposals become tax-free after a holding period exceeding one year, creating significant incentives for long-term holding. This approach recognises the speculative nature of cryptocurrency investment while encouraging stability in holding patterns.

Canada treats cryptocurrency as a commodity under the Income Tax Act, applying a 50 percent capital gains inclusion rate. The Canada Revenue Agency distinguishes between casual investors and business traders, with the latter subject to full income taxation on trading profits.

The European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which entered into force in June 2023, regulates market conduct for crypto-asset service providers. Rules on stablecoins applied from 30 June 2024, with full authorisation requirements for crypto-asset service providers effective from 30 December 2024. However, this regulation addresses market conduct rather than tax treatment, which remains within Member State competence. The grandfathering period for pre-existing entities extends until 1 July 2026.

## 3. Taxable Events and Income Categories

### 3.1. Disposals and Exchanges

Selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency constitutes a taxable disposal in virtually all jurisdictions applying property treatment. Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another similarly triggers recognition, as does spending cryptocurrency on goods or services. Simply purchasing cryptocurrency with fiat currency or transferring between one's own wallets does not create a taxable event.

### 3.2. Mining Income

Mining cryptocurrency generates ordinary income at fair market value upon receipt in most jurisdictions. The United States treats mining income as self-employment income when conducted as a business activity, subjecting it to both income tax and self-employment tax. Mining expenses qualify as deductible business expenses. The United Kingdom applies income tax at rates from 0 to 45 percent plus National Insurance contributions.

### 3.3. Staking Rewards

Revenue Ruling 2023-14, issued in July 2023, clarified that staking rewards become taxable when the taxpayer gains dominion and control over the tokens. The ruling treats rewards as ordinary income at fair market value on the date of receipt, applying to both direct blockchain staking and exchange-based staking. Subsequent disposal triggers capital gains or losses measured from this basis.

Proposed legislation in 2025, the Digital Asset PARITY Act, would permit a five-year deferral election for staking rewards, reflecting recognition that immediate taxation creates cash flow difficulties when taxpayers receive illiquid tokens.

### 3.4. Hard Forks and Airdrops

Revenue Ruling 2019-24 established that hard forks creating new tokens generate ordinary income at fair market value when the taxpayer receives the new cryptocurrency. Cost basis equals fair market value at receipt. Airdrops receive identical treatment, creating taxable income upon gaining dominion and control even for unsolicited distributions.

### 3.5. Non-Fungible Tokens

Notice 2023-27 addressed taxation of non-fungible tokens, determining that certain non-fungible tokens qualify as collectibles subject to a maximum 28 percent long-term capital gains rate. Minting non-fungible tokens generates business income, while purchasing does not create a taxable event. Sales and transfers trigger capital gains recognition.

### 3.6. Decentralised Finance

Decentralised finance transactions lack specific regulatory guidance in most jurisdictions. General principles suggest that token swaps constitute taxable exchanges, liquidity provision may trigger recognition when depositing tokens, and yield farming rewards receive treatment similar to staking income.

The December 2024 final regulations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code extended broker reporting requirements to decentralised finance platforms, effective from January 2027. However, the Senate voted 70 to 28 in March 2025 to repeal these regulations, citing the impracticality of imposing reporting obligations on decentralised protocols without custodial control over user assets.

## 4. International Tax Dimensions

### 4.1. Source and Residence Challenges

Traditional source rules based on physical location of income-generating activities apply awkwardly to blockchain transactions. Mining income might be sourced to the location of mining equipment, the residence of the miner, or the location of blockchain validation nodes. Trading gains present similar difficulties when conducted through decentralised exchanges without geographic anchoring.

Corporate residence determination for cryptocurrency businesses follows standard rules examining place of effective management and incorporation. However, the borderless nature of blockchain operations enables structures where substantive activities occur in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously, complicating residence analysis.

### 4.2. Transfer Pricing Considerations

Intercompany cryptocurrency transactions should satisfy arm's length standards under OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Price volatility creates valuation challenges requiring robust contemporaneous documentation. No specific transfer pricing guidance addresses cryptocurrency transactions, leaving taxpayers to apply traditional methodologies to novel fact patterns.

The absence of comparable uncontrolled transactions for many cryptocurrency transfers complicates arm's length analysis. Taxpayers may need to rely on cost-based methods or profit-split approaches where market comparables prove unavailable. Documentation should address the timing of valuations given intraday price movements and the selection of pricing sources among multiple exchanges with potentially different quoted prices.

### 4.3. Double Taxation and Treaty Issues

Cryptocurrency transactions may generate income subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions without clear relief mechanisms. A mining operation might face taxation where equipment is located, where the miner resides, and where mining pool servers operate. Double taxation conventions provide relief where income falls within treaty categories, but the classification of cryptocurrency income under treaty provisions remains uncertain.

Article 13 of the OECD Model Tax Convention governing capital gains typically allocates taxing rights to the residence state, but characterisation of cryptocurrency as property, commodity, or other income may affect treaty application. Article 21 covering other income provides residual protection, though its application to cryptocurrency gains lacks authoritative guidance.

## 5. OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework

The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework establishes automatic exchange of information for cryptocurrency transactions, modelled on the Common Reporting Standard for financial accounts. The framework requires crypto-asset service providers to collect tax residence information and identification numbers from users, report transaction details and account balances to domestic tax authorities, and facilitate international information exchange.

The OECD published XML schemas and transmission guidance in October 2024, with first exchanges scheduled for 2027 covering the 2026 reporting year. Fifty jurisdictions had formally committed to 2027 exchanges as of November 2025, including all Group of Seven members.

### 5.1. European Union Implementation

The European Union implemented the framework through the eighth amendment to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation, adopted in October 2023. Member States must transpose the directive by 31 December 2025, with data collection beginning 1 January 2026 and first reporting occurring between January and September 2027. Reporting entities include brokers, exchanges, wallet providers, and certain decentralised finance platforms.

### 5.2. United States Implementation

The United States established domestic broker reporting through final regulations issued in June 2024. From 1 January 2025, brokers must report gross proceeds on the new Form 1099-DA. Cost basis reporting becomes required from 1 January 2026 for assets acquired after 1 January 2023. Revenue Procedure 2024-28 provides a safe harbour for allocating basis to wallets as of 1 January 2025, replacing universal tracking methods.

Transitional relief under Notice 2024-56 and Notice 2025-33 provides relief for good faith filing efforts through 2027, with backup withholding requirements deferred until 1 January 2027.

### 5.3. United Kingdom Implementation

The United Kingdom will implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework from 2026, requiring exchanges and wallet providers to report to HMRC. Enhanced data sharing arrangements with major exchanges began operating in 2025 in anticipation of the full framework.

## 6. Tax-Favourable Jurisdictions

Twenty-one countries impose zero capital gains tax on cryptocurrency as of 2024, creating opportunities for tax-motivated relocation of individuals and businesses. El Salvador, having adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, imposes no capital gains tax and offers citizenship through a one million dollar Bitcoin donation programme. Singapore maintains no capital gains tax for investment holdings, attracting significant cryptocurrency business activity. Switzerland provides tax-free treatment at the federal level with cantons setting generally favourable rates, establishing itself as a major blockchain hub. Hong Kong applies no personal capital gains tax on investment cryptocurrency holdings.

These jurisdictions attract cryptocurrency businesses and high-net-worth holders, though the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework will increase transparency regarding assets held in these locations. Residence-by-investment programmes in several jurisdictions specifically target cryptocurrency wealth, offering permanent residence or citizenship in exchange for investment commitments. The interaction between favourable tax treatment and increasing reporting requirements creates complex planning considerations for internationally mobile cryptocurrency holders.

## 7. Conclusion

Digital currency taxation continues evolving as jurisdictions develop frameworks addressing novel transaction types and business models. Property classification predominates among major economies, with immediate recognition upon disposal, mining, staking, and airdrops. The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework represents the most significant international development, establishing transparency mechanisms that will substantially increase tax authority visibility into cryptocurrency holdings and transactions from 2027.

Practitioners must monitor ongoing developments, including potential staking deferral legislation, decentralised finance reporting requirements, and expanding international information exchange. The interaction between domestic classification rules and treaty provisions remains underexplored, creating both risks and planning opportunities for cross-border cryptocurrency activities.
