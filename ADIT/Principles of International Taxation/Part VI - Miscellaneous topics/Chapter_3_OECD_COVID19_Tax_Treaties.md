# Chapter 3. OECD Secretariat Analysis of Tax Treaties and the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

## 1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to international tax arrangements. Travel restrictions stranded executives abroad, forced employees to work from home across borders, and halted construction projects mid-completion. These circumstances raised immediate concerns about unintended tax consequences under double taxation conventions, particularly regarding permanent establishment creation and changes in tax residence.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Secretariat responded with guidance addressing these concerns. The analysis represents Secretariat views supported by Working Party 1 on Tax Conventions and the Exchange of Information, though it does not constitute binding positions of OECD member countries.

## 2. OECD Secretariat Guidance Documents

The OECD Secretariat issued two principal documents addressing pandemic tax treaty implications. The initial analysis appeared on 3 April 2020, responding to requests from concerned countries seeking clarity on immediate treaty interpretation questions. Updated guidance followed on 21 January 2021, incorporating additional country experiences and addressing situations where the pandemic extended beyond initial expectations.

Both documents emphasised the exceptional and temporary nature of pandemic-related disruptions. The guidance applied specifically to circumstances arising from government public health measures rather than voluntary business decisions.

## 3. Permanent Establishment Issues

### 3.1. Fixed Place of Business

The Secretariat concluded that temporary home working should not create a permanent establishment under Article 5 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD MTC). Home offices lack the "at disposal" requirement because employers have no access to or control over employees' homes. The arrangements resulted from government measures outside employer control, and employers continued providing offices that would normally be available. The temporary and exceptional nature of the situation meant home working lacked the permanence and continuity required for permanent establishment status.

### 3.2. Agency Permanent Establishment

Similar reasoning applied to dependent agent permanent establishments. The Secretariat determined that employees working from home solely due to government-imposed or recommended public health measures should not trigger agency permanent establishment status. Contract signing by home-based employees during the crisis lacked the habitual character required under Article 5(5), as presence in the jurisdiction was temporary rather than reflecting a regular pattern of activity.

### 3.3. Construction Sites

The guidance addressed construction site permanent establishments where projects exceeded time thresholds due to pandemic-related delays. The initial April 2020 guidance indicated that COVID-19 delays should be included in duration calculations, consistent with standard practice for temporary interruptions such as weather delays. However, the updated January 2021 guidance reversed this position, recommending that periods when operations were prevented by public health measures should be excluded from the calculation. This reversal proved controversial, and not all tax authorities accepted this approach, creating uncertainty for affected projects.

## 4. Corporate Residence

The Secretariat addressed concerns that travel restrictions might inadvertently change corporate tax residence. Under the place of effective management test used in pre-2017 treaties, companies risked residence changes if key executives became stranded in foreign jurisdictions.

The guidance concluded that COVID-19 circumstances should not drive residence determinations. Treaty tie-breaker provisions should examine usual and ordinary patterns rather than exceptional pandemic conditions. Temporary inability of management to travel due to public health measures should not affect the outcome of residence determination under either the place of effective management test or the mutual agreement procedure applicable under post-2017 treaties.

## 5. Individual Residence and Tie-Breaker Rules

Individuals temporarily stranded in foreign jurisdictions faced potential dual residence issues. A person attaining domestic law residence in a host country due to extended presence should not become treaty resident there under Article 4 tie-breaker provisions.

The permanent home, centre of vital interests, habitual abode, and nationality tests would typically award residence to the home state. Days spent abroad due to travel restrictions should not establish habitual abode in the host jurisdiction. The situation proved more complex for individuals returning to previous home locations, requiring detailed analysis of continuing connections to each jurisdiction.

## 6. Cross-Border Workers

Employment income taxation under Article 15 presented particular challenges. The 183-day threshold for source state taxation risked being exceeded when employees could not return to their normal work location.

The Secretariat recommended that days when employees were prevented from travelling due to COVID-19 should not count toward the 183-day threshold. Payments should remain attributable to the place where the employee would normally have worked rather than the actual pandemic location. Several neighbouring countries negotiated bilateral agreements treating COVID-19 as force majeure, excluding home-working days from treaty calculations.

## 7. Country Responses

Implementation varied across jurisdictions. Countries with severe lockdown policies introduced more comprehensive tax relief measures addressing pandemic-specific circumstances. Countries with less restrictive containment measures introduced fewer COVID-specific provisions.

The OECD Tax Policy Reforms 2021 report documented measures across seventy jurisdictions, covering all OECD and Group of Twenty (G20) countries plus twenty-one additional OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS members. Some jurisdictions adopted approaches differing from OECD recommendations, particularly regarding construction site calculations and the 183-day employment income threshold.

## 8. Post-Pandemic Developments

The COVID-19 guidance applied specifically to the pandemic period and was explicitly time-limited. As remote working became permanent for many employees, the temporary pandemic framework proved insufficient for ongoing situations.

The OECD published a comprehensive update to the OECD MTC on 18 November 2025, providing permanent guidance on cross-border remote work. The 2025 framework introduces a 50 percent threshold: a location constitutes a fixed place of business if an employee works there more than 50 percent of the time over a rolling twelve-month period. The update also introduces a commercial reason test, requiring genuine business connection to a location rather than mere employee convenience or cost savings.

The COVID-19 guidance remains relevant for understanding the 2020-2021 period but practitioners should apply the 2025 framework for ongoing remote work arrangements.
