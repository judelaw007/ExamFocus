# Chapter 1.1. Indirect Taxes and International Taxation: The Origin and Destination Bases

## 1. Introduction to Indirect Taxation in Cross-Border Context

International taxation of indirect taxes operates on fundamentally different principles than income taxation. While income taxes apply primarily to residents on worldwide income or to non-residents on source income, consumption taxes focus on where goods and services are ultimately consumed. This distinction creates separate frameworks for preventing double taxation and ensuring trade neutrality.

Consumption taxes—including value added tax, goods and services tax, sales taxes, and excise duties—raise substantial revenue globally. Approximately one hundred and seventy-five countries operate VAT or GST systems, representing ninety percent of United Nations member states. Within OECD countries, VAT accounts for 20.8 percent of total tax revenue, making consumption taxes the third largest revenue source after social security contributions and personal income tax.

The challenge for international indirect taxation lies in determining which jurisdiction has taxing rights over cross-border transactions. Two competing principles address this question: the origin principle and the destination principle. Understanding these principles and their practical application forms the foundation for analysing international VAT and GST issues.

## 2. The Origin Principle

### 2.1. Definition and Mechanics

Under the origin principle, indirect taxes apply in the country where goods are produced or services originate. The producing or exporting country retains taxing rights, while the importing country grants relief to avoid double taxation. Goods exported carry the origin country's tax burden, with importing countries providing credit or exemption for taxes already paid.

The origin principle aligns conceptually with source-based taxation of income—both focus on where economic activity occurs rather than where benefits are enjoyed. Historical customs systems and early indirect tax regimes often operated on origin-based approaches, taxing production and export activity within territorial boundaries.

### 2.2. Implications for International Trade

The origin principle creates significant competitive distortions in international trade. Products from high-tax jurisdictions face disadvantage in export markets, as they carry higher embedded tax costs than competing products from low-tax jurisdictions. Conversely, domestic producers face competitive pressure from imports that arrive without equivalent tax burden.

These distortions explain why the origin principle has been largely abandoned for consumption taxes in international trade. The economic inefficiencies—distorting production location decisions based on tax rates rather than comparative advantage—conflict with free trade objectives. Countries with higher consumption tax rates would see their exports disadvantaged and imports favoured, creating incentives for tax competition and undermining revenue bases.

The academic literature recognises that origin-based consumption taxation can only function effectively in a fully integrated economic area with harmonised tax rates—a condition rarely achieved even within regional blocs. The European Union, despite significant integration, operates its VAT system on the destination principle for cross-border transactions precisely because member states maintain different VAT rates.

## 3. The Destination Principle

### 3.1. Definition and Rationale

The destination principle provides that consumption taxes apply in the country where goods and services are ultimately consumed. The consuming or importing jurisdiction exercises taxing rights, while the producing or exporting jurisdiction relinquishes its claim. This approach ensures that the tax burden reflects the tax policy of the country where consumption occurs, regardless of production location.

The OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines, approved in 2015 and endorsed by over one hundred and four jurisdictions, establish the destination principle as the international standard for consumption taxes. The guidelines state that VAT should be levied only on final consumption occurring within the taxing jurisdiction, and that cross-border supplies should be taxed according to the rules of the jurisdiction of consumption.

The economic logic supporting the destination principle reflects consumer welfare analysis. Consumption taxes ultimately burden consumers, not producers. Taxing consumption where it occurs ensures the tax burden aligns with the policy choices of the jurisdiction whose residents benefit from public services funded by consumption tax revenue. This alignment between tax burden and benefit location provides normative justification for the destination principle beyond its trade neutrality advantages.

### 3.2. Trade Neutrality

The destination principle achieves trade neutrality by treating domestic and imported goods identically at the point of consumption. Two mechanisms implement this neutrality in practice.

First, exports are zero-rated or exempt with refund. The exporting country applies a zero rate to export transactions while permitting recovery of input tax incurred on purchased goods and services. This removes the producing country's tax entirely from exported products, allowing them to enter foreign markets without domestic tax burden.

Second, imports are taxed on the same basis as domestic supplies. The importing country applies its standard VAT or GST rate to imported goods and services, ensuring competitive equality with domestically produced alternatives. Border tax adjustments—the combination of export relief and import taxation—implement the destination principle at national boundaries.

This approach eliminates tax-induced distortions in production location decisions. Producers compete on pre-tax costs and efficiency rather than relative tax burdens. The destination principle thus supports international trade objectives by ensuring tax neutrality across borders.

## 4. Application to Cross-Border Transactions

### 4.1. Business-to-Business Transactions

Cross-border business-to-business supplies typically apply the destination principle through the reverse charge mechanism. Rather than requiring non-resident suppliers to register and collect tax in each customer jurisdiction, the business customer self-assesses and accounts for VAT or GST in its own tax return.

The reverse charge operates by shifting collection responsibility from supplier to recipient. The business customer reports output tax on the supply received, then claims corresponding input tax credit where entitled. The net effect for fully taxable businesses is often neutral, but the mechanism ensures the destination country captures revenue on its consumption tax base.

This approach offers administrative efficiency by eliminating the need for non-resident supplier registration in business-to-business contexts. The OECD Guidelines recommend the reverse charge as the preferred mechanism for cross-border business-to-business supplies of services and intangibles. Most jurisdictions worldwide have adopted this approach, though approximately twenty-five countries—including certain Canadian provinces, Indonesia, Kenya, and Mexico—require non-resident registration even for business-to-business supplies.

### 4.2. Business-to-Consumer Transactions

Business-to-consumer cross-border supplies present greater implementation challenges. Private consumers lack VAT registration and cannot self-assess through reverse charge mechanisms. Ensuring destination-based taxation requires non-resident suppliers to register, collect, and remit tax in consumer jurisdictions.

Over one hundred and ten jurisdictions have implemented remote-seller VAT rules requiring non-resident suppliers of digital services to register and collect consumption tax (covered in December 2024). This number continues to grow, with significant expansion across Africa in recent years. The Philippines enacted VAT obligations for non-resident digital providers in October 2024, joining the growing global consensus on destination-based taxation of digital consumption.

Registration thresholds vary significantly across jurisdictions. Australia applies a threshold of seventy-five thousand Australian dollars in annual supplies to Australian consumers. India imposes no registration threshold for non-resident suppliers to consumers, requiring immediate registration before the first taxable supply. The European Union eliminated thresholds for intra-EU distance sales in 2021, requiring registration from the first euro of cross-border consumer sales.

Standard VAT rates also vary considerably, affecting the compliance burden for suppliers operating across multiple jurisdictions. The OECD average standard rate reached 19.3 percent in 2024, with individual country rates ranging from five percent in some jurisdictions to over twenty-five percent in others. Recent years have seen rate increases in several countries—Turkey increased from eighteen to twenty percent, Estonia from twenty to twenty-two percent—reflecting fiscal pressures and the relative efficiency of consumption taxes as revenue instruments.

## 5. Implementation Frameworks

### 5.1. OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines

The OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines provide the leading international framework for applying the destination principle to cross-border services and intangibles. Adopted as an OECD Council Recommendation in September 2016, the guidelines establish consensus standards that jurisdictions can reference when designing domestic legislation.

The guidelines address place of supply rules for services—the critical determination for identifying which jurisdiction has taxing rights. For business-to-business supplies, the guidelines recommend taxation in the jurisdiction where the business recipient has established its business presence. For business-to-consumer supplies, taxation occurs where the consumer has their usual residence.

Simplified registration and compliance regimes form a key recommendation. Recognising the administrative burden of requiring full domestic registration in every consumer jurisdiction, the guidelines encourage streamlined processes for non-resident suppliers. These typically include simplified registration applications, quarterly or annual returns, and exemption from full domestic compliance requirements. The guidelines also address the role of intermediaries and fiscal representatives, recommending that jurisdictions not require appointment of local representatives where simplified registration provides adequate compliance assurance.

### 5.2. European Union VAT Framework

The European Union operates the most developed implementation of destination-based consumption taxation for digital and cross-border services. The One-Stop Shop system, introduced in 2015 for digital services and expanded in 2021, permits suppliers to register in a single EU member state and report VAT due across all twenty-seven member states through a unified return.

The system has achieved significant scale. In 2024, the three One-Stop Shop schemes collectively processed over thirty-three billion euros in VAT declarations, representing a twenty-seven percent increase from the previous year. Over one hundred and seventy thousand traders participate across the Union, Non-Union, and Import schemes.

The VAT in the Digital Age package, adopted by the Council of the European Union on 11 March 2025, represents the most significant reform of EU VAT in decades. Implementation proceeds in phases: expanded One-Stop Shop coverage from January 2027, single VAT registration enabling one registration for all EU business-to-consumer supplies from July 2028, and mandatory digital reporting for business-to-business transactions from July 2030.

## 6. Practical Considerations and Emerging Developments

The destination principle faces ongoing implementation challenges in the digital economy. Platform and marketplace operators increasingly bear collection responsibilities under deemed supplier rules. The European Union has made platforms liable for VAT on certain transactions since 2021, and similar rules operate in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions.

The practical question of identifying consumer location—essential for determining the destination jurisdiction—requires proxy indicators such as payment card country, IP address location, or declared residence. These proxies create complexity and potential for error, particularly for low-value transactions where detailed verification proves impractical.

Enforcement mechanisms continue to evolve. Several jurisdictions have implemented or proposed automatic registration powers, permitting tax authorities to register non-compliant sellers without application. Payment provider reporting obligations, effective in the European Union from January 2024, enable authorities to identify cross-border transaction flows and detect unregistered suppliers.

The destination principle also intersects with border tax adjustment rules under international trade law, where questions arise about whether consumption tax adjustments at borders comply with World Trade Organization obligations (covered in June 2024). The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permits border tax adjustments for indirect taxes but not for direct taxes—a distinction that reflects the fundamental difference between origin and destination-based taxation and continues to generate analytical and policy debate.

Understanding the origin and destination principles provides foundation for analysing specific issues in international indirect taxation, including the treatment of digital services, platform economy transactions, and the interaction between consumption taxes and international trade agreements.
