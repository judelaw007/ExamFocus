# Chapter 2.2: Treaty Override

## 1. The Treaty Override Problem

### 1.1. The Fundamental Tension

Building on the incorporation concepts explored in Chapter 2.1, treaty override addresses a critical question in international tax law: what happens when a state's domestic legislation conflicts with its DTC obligations?

Double taxation conventions are legally binding international instruments. Under public international law, states mutually undertake to respect and apply DTC provisions. Yet domestic legislatures may enact laws that contradict treaty obligations—either intentionally or unintentionally. This creates a fundamental tension between international law obligations requiring states to honour treaty commitments, domestic sovereignty allowing legislatures to enact laws for their citizens, and the tax policy flexibility states may need to respond to changing circumstances.

The resolution of this tension depends on how each state incorporates international treaties into its domestic legal order and the constitutional status afforded to such treaties once incorporated.

### 1.2. The Binding Nature of DTCs Under International Law

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) establishes the foundational legal framework for understanding states' treaty obligations. Two provisions are particularly relevant to the treaty override question.

Article 26 of the VCLT codifies the principle of *pacta sunt servanda*: "Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith." This ancient principle of international law establishes that treaty obligations are not merely political commitments but legally binding undertakings that states must honour.

Article 27 reinforces this by providing that "a party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty." This means that from the perspective of international law, a state cannot excuse non-compliance with treaty obligations by pointing to conflicting domestic legislation—even if that legislation was enacted after the treaty came into force.

These principles mean that treaty override, while potentially valid domestically in certain legal systems, constitutes a breach of international law obligations. The practical consequence is that the treaty partner state may have legitimate grounds for complaint under international law, even if the overriding state's courts give effect to the domestic legislation.

## 2. Definition and Types of Treaty Override

### 2.1. Definition

Understanding precisely what constitutes treaty override is essential because the legal and diplomatic consequences differ significantly depending on how a conflict between domestic law and treaty obligations is characterised. Some apparent conflicts may not constitute override at all, while others clearly breach international law.

The OECD 1989 Report on Tax Treaty Override defined treaty override as "a situation where the domestic legislation of a State overrules treaty provisions of either a single treaty or all treaties hitherto having had effect in that State." More broadly, treaty override implies that a contracting state, by legislative action, gives preference to domestic law over international law and thereby refuses to fulfil certain obligations arising from the DTC.

This definition encompasses situations where domestic legislation either explicitly contradicts treaty provisions or has the practical effect of nullifying treaty benefits that taxpayers would otherwise enjoy. The definition is broad enough to capture both targeted overrides affecting specific treaties and general legislative changes affecting all of a state's treaty network.

### 2.2. Intentional Override

Intentional override occurs when the legislature deliberately enacts domestic legislation intended to have effects in clear contradiction to DTC obligations. This type of override is characterised by explicit legislative intent to supersede treaty provisions, often motivated by revenue protection or anti-avoidance concerns.

Intentional override most clearly violates international law principles because the state is knowingly choosing to breach its treaty obligations. The United States has historically been most associated with this type of override, having enacted various provisions that explicitly override prior treaty commitments. The "later-in-time" rule in US constitutional law provides that a later statute can override an earlier treaty, treating both as having equivalent legal status.

### 2.3. Unintentional Override

Unintentional override occurs when a state's newly adopted domestic legislation is incompatible with DTC provisions, without the competent organs intending, or even being aware of, such an effect. This type of override often results from technical amendments to domestic tax law where the drafters did not consider treaty implications.

While there is no deliberate intent to override, unintentional override is equally problematic from an international law perspective. The VCLT does not distinguish between intentional and unintentional breaches—both constitute failures to perform treaty obligations in good faith. The practical challenge is that unintentional overrides may only be discovered when the legislation is applied in a specific case, by which point taxpayers and treaty partners may have already been affected.

### 2.4. Judicial Override

Judicial override occurs when courts give effect to domestic tax legislation in a manner that overrides the terms of the DTC. As Roxan (1997) observed, this may arise because courts are suspicious that DTC provisions may have disruptive effects on the domestic tax system, courts are less familiar with DTC interpretation than with domestic legislation, or there is a preference for domestic law interpretive approaches.

Judicial override is particularly insidious because it may not be immediately apparent. Courts may purport to be interpreting the treaty while in practice giving precedence to domestic law concepts.

There is disagreement about when override occurs. The OECD (1989) took the view that override occurs when domestic law is passed—even if the law is never applied. Wouters & Vidal (2006) suggested that override only occurs when the law is applied.

## 3. The Role of Incorporation Method

### 3.1. Monist and Dualist Systems

The method by which a state incorporates DTCs into its domestic legal order directly affects the possibility of treaty override. This builds on the concepts introduced in Chapter 2.1 regarding the incorporation of DTCs into domestic law.

In monist systems, treaties are treated as *lex specialis* (special law) and typically enjoy superior status to ordinary domestic legislation. Countries following this approach include the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland. In these jurisdictions, treaty override is generally unconstitutional because the constitution prevents ordinary legislation from superseding treaty obligations. If a conflict arises between a treaty and domestic law, the treaty prevails.

In dualist systems, treaties require transformation into domestic law through implementing legislation, and the implementing statute typically has the same rank as ordinary domestic statutes. Countries following this approach include the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. In these jurisdictions, the principle of *lex posterior* (later law prevails over earlier law) can apply, meaning that a later domestic statute may override earlier treaty provisions.

### 3.2. Key Legal Principles

Several Latin maxims capture the competing legal principles at play in treaty override situations.

The principle of *lex specialis derogat legi generali* provides that special law prevails over general law. When applied to treaties, this suggests that treaties, as special law addressing specific situations, should prevail over general domestic tax legislation. Some jurisdictions apply this principle to protect treaties from override.

The principle of *lex posterior derogat legi priori* provides that later law prevails over earlier law. This principle, when applied in dualist systems, allows later domestic legislation to override earlier treaty provisions.

A refinement of these principles is *lex posterior generalis non derogat legi priori speciali*, meaning that a later general law does not override an earlier special law. Some jurisdictions apply this refinement to protect treaties, reasoning that a general change to domestic tax law should not be interpreted as overriding specific treaty provisions unless Parliament clearly intended this result.

### 3.3. The OECD Position

The OECD Recommendation of the Council concerning Tax Treaty Override (1989) notes that "treaty override depends to a large extent on each state's legal system, how, and at what level, international law treaties, customary law, and general principles is placed at the domestic level."

The level attributed to DTC obligations determines whether derogations are unconstitutional. A state's ability to override depends on both its constitutional law and the degree of legislative involvement in treaty-making. In dualist jurisdictions, there is seemingly no domestic constitutional limitation preventing override, which is precisely why the OECD felt it necessary to issue guidance recommending restraint.

## 4. The OECD 1989 Recommendation

### 4.1. Background and Content

The 1989 OECD Report on Tax Treaty Override and accompanying Council Recommendation remain the authoritative OECD position on this topic. The report emerged from concern that "the certainty that tax treaties bring to international tax matters has, in the past few years, been called into question, and to some extent undermined, by the tendency in certain States for domestic legislation to be passed or proposed which may override provisions of tax treaties."

The Council Recommendation provides that member countries should "avoid enacting legislation which is intended to have effects in clear contradiction to international treaty obligations." While this recommendation is not legally binding, it represents a strong statement of policy by the OECD's governing body and reflects the consensus view of member states on appropriate behaviour.

### 4.2. Report Findings

The 1989 Report made several key findings. It confirmed that treaty override through conflicting domestic legislation is illegal under international law, based on VCLT Articles 26 and 27. It acknowledged that state practice varies considerably, with the possibility of override depending on each state's constitutional framework.

The Report recommended that states should consult treaty partners before enacting potentially conflicting legislation, and that states should act in good faith to comply with the treaty's object and purpose. This latter point connects to the VCLT requirement of good faith performance—even where override is technically possible under domestic law, states should exercise restraint.

### 4.3. Legitimate Objectives

Notably, the 1989 Report acknowledged that certain overriding legislation may be considered legitimate. It stated that "domestic measures that seek to counter tax avoidance may constitute DTA override but may be considered to constitute a legitimate objective for the use of overriding legislation."

This acknowledgment creates the foundation for ongoing debate about when, if ever, treaty override can be justified. The Report did not provide a blanket endorsement of anti-avoidance overrides but recognised that some states would view such measures as necessary and appropriate. This nuanced position has influenced subsequent discussions about the legitimacy of various domestic anti-avoidance measures. *(covered in June 2023)*

## 5. Can Treaty Override Be Justified?

### 5.1. Arguments Against Justification

Several compelling arguments support the view that treaty override cannot be justified.

From an international law perspective, Vogel (1997) stated definitively that "DTA override is a violation of international law." This position is grounded in VCLT Articles 26 and 27—treaties must be performed in good faith, and states cannot invoke domestic law as justification for breach. From this perspective, override is simply unlawful, regardless of the domestic policy reasons that motivated it.

Treaty override also undermines the certainty that DTCs are designed to provide. These conventions exist to provide taxpayers with certainty about their tax treatment when engaging in cross-border activities. Override undermines economic relations and cross-border investment by creating unpredictability. Taxpayers who structured their affairs in reliance on treaty benefits may find those benefits withdrawn by subsequent domestic legislation.

Override damages the relationship between contracting states. It erodes trust and may provoke retaliatory override by the treaty partner. It also undermines cooperative tax administration, including the mutual agreement procedure and exchange of information, because these mechanisms depend on mutual trust and good faith.

Finally, override contradicts the spirit of multilateral coordination that has become increasingly important in international taxation. The BEPS Project and the Inclusive Framework demonstrate that consensus-driven change is achievable. Unilateral override undermines these cooperative efforts.

### 5.2. Arguments For Justification

Counterarguments suggest that the concerns about treaty override may be overstated or that certain overrides may be defensible.

Elliffe (2022) argued that DTCs are a "special category" of treaties because Article 3(2) creates an ambulatory reference to domestic law. Since treaties anticipate that domestic law meanings will change over time, some changes to domestic law are "baked into" the treaty structure. This does not justify all overrides but suggests that the treaty override problem may be less stark than sometimes portrayed.

The OECD itself acknowledged that anti-avoidance measures may constitute a legitimate objective for override. If the purpose of DTCs includes preventing tax avoidance and evasion, then domestic anti-abuse measures may actually align with treaty purposes. The OECD Commentary supports this view by stating that CFC rules are compatible with treaties.

Avi-Yonah (2006) advanced the "prevalence argument"—that treaty override rarely happens in practice because states generally act in good faith. Override is typically used only in extreme cases as a last resort. This pragmatic observation suggests that the treaty override problem, while theoretically significant, may not be a major practical concern.

Some measures characterised as override may not actually constitute override at all. CFC rules are said to tax the resident shareholder, not the foreign company, so there is no breach of Article 7. The UK's Diverted Profits Tax was claimed to be a "separate and distinct tax" outside DTC scope. India's Equalisation Levy was enacted outside the Income Tax Act to take it outside treaty coverage. These characterisation arguments are contested but illustrate that the line between override and non-override is not always clear.

Bartlett (1991) noted that some "overrides" may actually be acceptable to the treaty partner, particularly where both states share concerns about abuse. In such cases, override may be a practical solution while treaty renegotiation proceeds.

### 5.3. The Article 3(2) Ambulatory Interpretation Argument

Article 3(2) of the OECD MTC provides that undefined terms have the meaning under the domestic law of the applying state "unless the context otherwise requires." This creates an ambulatory interpretation—the meaning follows current domestic law, not the law at the time the treaty was signed.

Elliffe (2022) argued that this means "situations of technical override are expressly contemplated and 'baked into' DTAs." When domestic law changes and a term's meaning changes with it, this is anticipated by the treaty itself. However, this argument has limits—changes that go beyond the treaty's context would still constitute override. The context requirement ensures that domestic law changes cannot be used to defeat the treaty's object and purpose.

## 6. Specific Examples and Controversies

The theoretical debate about treaty override gains practical significance when examined through specific examples. These cases illustrate the tensions that arise when states pursue domestic policy objectives that may conflict with their treaty commitments, and the various strategies states employ to reconcile these competing interests.

### 6.1. CFC Rules and DTC Compatibility

Controlled Foreign Corporation rules present perhaps the most extensively debated example of potential treaty override. *(covered in December 2022)*

CFC rules tax resident shareholders on income derived by foreign companies they control, effectively extending the residence state's taxation to foreign-source income before it is distributed. The question is whether this conflicts with Article 7, which provides that business profits of an enterprise are taxable only in the state of residence of that enterprise.

The OECD's position, set out in the Commentary on Article 1, paragraph 81, is that "there is no conflict between DTAs and CFC legislation." The rationale is that CFC rules tax residents (the shareholders), not the foreign CFC itself. Article 1(3) explicitly preserves the right of states to apply CFC legislation. When read in "context," CFC rules are not contrary to the OECD MTC.

However, this position is not universally accepted. Switzerland has made an observation stating that CFC rules may be contrary to Article 7(1) depending on the relevant concept used. The French Conseil d'État in Schneider Electric (2002) ruled that the French CFC regime infringed Article 7 of the France-Switzerland Treaty. In contrast, the English Court of Appeal in Bricom found the UK CFC regime unaffected by the Netherlands-UK Treaty, based on how the UK regime was drafted.

Following Schneider Electric, France modified its CFC rules to deem profits "distributed," thereby recharacterising the income as movable capital rather than business profits. This illustrates how states may redesign legislation to avoid treaty conflicts while achieving similar policy objectives.

### 6.2. UK Diverted Profits Tax

The UK introduced the Diverted Profits Tax in 2015 as a targeted measure against aggressive profit shifting. The UK government's position was that DPT is a "separate and distinct tax" outside DTC scope, and HMRC maintained that DPT is not a "covered tax" for purposes of the UK DTA network.

Critics argued that substance over form suggests DPT targets the same profits as income tax, making the separate tax characterisation questionable. Whether DPT constitutes treaty override depends on how the tax is characterised under Article 2 of DTCs, which determines the taxes covered.

Significantly, the UK announced in 2024 that it will reform the DPT regime, removing DPT's status as a separate tax and bringing an equivalent charge within corporation tax from 1 January 2026. This reform will provide access to treaty benefits, including the mutual agreement procedure, while maintaining key features of the regime. The reform acknowledges the treaty compatibility concerns that had been raised.

### 6.3. India Equalisation Levy

India introduced the Equalisation Levy in 2016 (targeting digital advertising services at 6%) and expanded it in 2020 (targeting e-commerce at 2%). India enacted these levies outside its Income Tax Act to take them outside the ambit of its double taxation treaties.

This approach is controversial. Many tax treaties contain clauses bringing into their scope any charges "substantially similar" to covered taxes, and critics argued that the Equalisation Levy is an "alternative income tax" contravening the PE concept. The levy imposes tax on non-residents without PE in India, potentially creating juridical double taxation.

In July 2024, India announced that the 2% Equalisation Levy would no longer apply to transactions from 1 August 2024, citing ambiguity and compliance burden. The original 6% levy on digital advertising was subsequently abolished from 1 April 2025. The complete withdrawal of these unilateral measures reflects both practical difficulties and India's alignment with ongoing multilateral negotiations under the OECD's Pillar One framework.

### 6.4. Pillar Two and Treaty Compatibility

The OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax raises emerging treaty compatibility questions. The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) impose top-up taxation on low-taxed income of multinational groups.

The concern is whether Article 7 of existing treaties precludes additional taxation at the parent level on business profits produced by foreign group entities. If Pillar Two rules are incompatible with treaties, they become unenforceable in countries that do not allow treaty overrides under their constitutional law—a significant practical problem for a regime designed to apply uniformly.

The OECD's position is that the IIR and UTPR do not pose treaty incompatibility issues because they tax the domestic shareholder, not the foreign entity—similar reasoning to that applied to CFC rules. However, the Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) component of Pillar Two is being implemented through a dedicated multilateral instrument, signed in September 2024, which modifies treaties to allow source-state taxation on undertaxed payments. *(covered in December 2024)*

## 7. Alternatives to Treaty Override

The debate about treaty override must recognise that override is not the only option available to states seeking to address perceived problems with their treaty networks.

Bilateral consultation allows states to engage treaty partners without unilateral action. Protocol negotiation enables states to amend treaties through agreed protocols, maintaining the consensual foundation of the treaty relationship.

Multilateral coordination through the Inclusive Framework allows states to address common concerns collectively. The BEPS Project demonstrates that consensus-driven change is achievable.

The Multilateral Instrument (MLI) provides a mechanism to update multiple treaties simultaneously, incorporating anti-abuse provisions and other changes without bilateral renegotiation of each treaty.

Full treaty renegotiation, while slow, ensures changes have the consent of both parties and comply with international law.

As Elliffe (2022) observed, "when significant cooperation between states occurs, it is possible to achieve fundamental, consensus-driven change." The MLI and Inclusive Framework demonstrate this possibility. These alternatives suggest that override should be a last resort rather than a first response to treaty concerns.
