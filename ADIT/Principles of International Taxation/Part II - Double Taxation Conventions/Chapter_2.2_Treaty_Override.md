## A. INTRODUCTION: THE TREATY OVERRIDE PROBLEM

### 1. The Fundamental Tension

Building on the incorporation concepts from **Chapter 2.1**, treaty override addresses a critical question:

> **What happens when a state's domestic legislation conflicts with its DTC obligations?**

DTCs are legally binding international instruments. Under public international law, states mutually undertake to respect and apply DTC provisions. Yet domestic legislatures may enact laws that contradict treaty obligations—either intentionally or unintentionally.

This creates tension between:
- **International law obligations**: States must honour treaty commitments
- **Domestic sovereignty**: Legislatures retain power to enact laws for their citizens
- **Tax policy flexibility**: States may need to respond to changing circumstances

### 2. Binding Nature of DTCs

The **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT)** establishes the legal framework:

| VCLT Provision | Principle | Implication |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Article 26** | *Pacta sunt servanda* | "Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith" |
| **Article 27** | Domestic law no excuse | "A party may not invoke provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty" |

These principles mean that treaty override, while potentially valid domestically, constitutes a **breach of international law obligations**.

---

## B. DEFINITION AND TYPES OF TREATY OVERRIDE

### 1. Definition

The **OECD 1989 Report on Tax Treaty Override** defined treaty override as:

> "A situation where the domestic legislation of a State overrules treaty provisions of either a single treaty or all treaties hitherto having had effect in that State."

More broadly, treaty override implies that a contracting state, by legislative action, gives **preference to domestic law over international law**, and thus refuses to fulfill certain obligations arising from the DTC.

### 2. Types of Treaty Override

```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### A. Intentional Override

The legislature **deliberately** enacts domestic legislation intended to have effects in clear contradiction to DTC obligations.

**Characteristics**:
- Explicit legislative intent to override treaty
- Often motivated by revenue protection or anti-avoidance
- Most clearly violates international law principles
- US historically most associated with this type

#### B. Unintentional Override

A state's **newly adopted domestic legislation** is incompatible with DTC provisions, without the competent organs intending, or even being aware of, such effect.

**Characteristics**:
- No deliberate intent to override
- Often results from technical amendments
- May be discovered only when applied
- Equally problematic from international law perspective

#### C. Judicial Override

Courts give effect to domestic tax legislation in a manner that **overrides the terms of the DTA**.

**Causes** (per Roxan, 1997):
- Courts suspicious that DTA provisions may have "disruptive" effect on domestic tax system
- Courts less familiar with DTA interpretation than domestic legislation
- Preference for domestic law interpretive approaches

### 3. When Does Override Occur?

Disagreement exists about the precise moment of override:

| View | When Override Occurs | Implication |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| **OECD (1989)** | When domestic law is passed | Override exists even if law never applied |
| **Wouters & Vidal (2006)** | When law is applied | Override only if actual conflict in application |

---

## C. THE ROLE OF INCORPORATION METHOD

### 1. Link to Chapter 2.1

The **method of DTC incorporation** directly affects treaty override possibility:

```
INCORPORATION METHOD AND OVERRIDE POSSIBILITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MONIST SYSTEMS                    DUALIST SYSTEMS
(Treaty = Lex Specialis)          (Treaty via Implementing Law)

### 2. Key Legal Principles

| Principle | Latin | Meaning | Application |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Lex specialis** | *Lex specialis derogat legi generali* | Special law prevails over general law | Treaties as special law prevail over general domestic law |
| **Lex posterior** | *Lex posterior derogat legi priori* | Later law prevails over earlier law | Later domestic legislation may override earlier treaty |
| **Lex posterior generalis** | *Lex posterior generalis non derogat legi priori speciali* | Later general law does not override earlier special law | Some jurisdictions apply this to protect treaties |

### 3. The OECD Position

The **OECD Recommendation of the Council concerning Tax Treaty Override** (1989) notes:

> "Treaty override depends to a large extent on each state's legal system, how, and at what level, international law treaties, customary law, and general principles is placed at the domestic level."

**Key observations**:
- The level attributed to DTC obligations determines whether derogations are unconstitutional
- A state's ability to override depends on both constitutional law AND legislative involvement in treaty-making
- In dualist jurisdictions, there is seemingly no domestic constitutional limitation preventing override

---

## D. THE OECD 1989 RECOMMENDATION

### 1. Background and Content

The **1989 OECD Report on Tax Treaty Override** and accompanying **Council Recommendation** remain the authoritative OECD position on this topic.

**Key Recommendation**:
> "The Council recommends that member countries avoid enacting legislation which is intended to have effects in clear contradiction to international treaty obligations."

### 2. Report Findings

| Finding | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **International law violation** | Treaty override through conflicting domestic legislation is illegal under international law |
| **State practice varies** | Override possibility depends on each state's constitutional framework |
| **Consultation recommended** | States should consult treaty partners before enacting potentially conflicting legislation |
| **Good faith required** | States should act in good faith to comply with treaty object and purpose |

### 3. Legitimate Objectives

The 1989 Report acknowledged that **certain overriding legislation** may be considered legitimate:

> "Domestic measures that seek to counter tax avoidance may constitute DTA override but may be considered to constitute a legitimate objective for the use of overriding legislation."

This creates the foundation for the **justification debate** that examiners frequently test.

---

## E. CAN TREATY OVERRIDE BE JUSTIFIED?

This was the **exact question asked in June 2023 Q3** (25 marks). Candidates must present balanced arguments.

### 1. Arguments AGAINST Justification

```
ARGUMENTS AGAINST TREATY OVERRIDE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INTERNATIONAL LAW VIOLATION
• Vogel (1997): "DTA override is a violation of international law"
• Breaches pacta sunt servanda (VCLT Article 26)
• Cannot invoke domestic law as excuse (VCLT Article 27)

UNDERMINES CERTAINTY
• DTAs exist to provide certainty for taxpayers
• Override undermines economic relations and cross-border investment
• Creates unpredictability in international tax planning

RELATIONSHIP DAMAGE
• Damages trust between contracting states
• May provoke retaliatory override by treaty partner
• Undermines cooperative tax administration

MULTILATERAL COORDINATION
• Override undermines international coordination efforts
• BEPS/Inclusive Framework show consensus-driven change is possible
• Unilateral override contradicts spirit of cooperation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Arguments FOR Justification (or Limiting Override Concern)

```
ARGUMENTS FOR/LIMITING OVERRIDE CONCERN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DTAs AS SPECIAL TREATIES
• DTAs are "special category" of treaties (Elliffe, 2022)
• Article 3(2): Ambulatory reference to domestic law "baked in"
• Treaty anticipates domestic law changes in some circumstances

ANTI-AVOIDANCE JUSTIFICATION
• DTA purpose includes preventing tax avoidance/evasion
• Domestic anti-abuse measures may align with treaty purpose
• OECD Commentary supports CFC rules as compatible

PREVALENCE ARGUMENT (Avi-Yonah, 2006)
• Treaty override rarely happens in practice
• States generally act in good faith
• Override used only in extreme cases as last resort

"NOT ACTUALLY OVERRIDE" ARGUMENTS
• CFC rules: Tax own residents, not foreign company
• DPT: Claimed to be separate tax outside treaty scope
• Equalisation Levy: Not a "covered tax" for DTA purposes

ALTERNATIVE TO RENEGOTIATION
• Bilateral renegotiation slow and difficult
• Override may address urgent policy needs
• Bartlett (1991): Some "overrides" acceptable to treaty partner

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. The Article 3(2) "Built-In Override" Argument

A sophisticated argument from the June 2023 exam solutions:

Article 3(2) OECD MTC provides that undefined terms have the meaning under domestic law "unless the context otherwise requires." This creates an **ambulatory interpretation**—meaning follows current domestic law, not law at treaty signature.

**Implication** (Elliffe, 2022):
- "Situations of technical override are expressly contemplated and 'baked into' DTAs"
- Domestic law changes may not constitute override if within treaty context
- BUT: Changes going beyond treaty context would still be overridden

---

## F. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND CONTROVERSIES

### 1. CFC Rules and DTC Compatibility

**December 2022 Q5** extensively covered this topic.

```
CFC RULES AND DTC INTERACTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE CONCERN:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CFC rules tax resident shareholders on income derived by       │
│ foreign companies they control—"extended jurisdiction to tax"  │
│                                                                 │
│ Question: Does this conflict with Article 7 (Business Profits) │
│ which gives taxing rights to state of enterprise residence?    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

THE OECD POSITION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Commentary on Article 1, [81]:                                  │
│ "There is no conflict between DTAs and CFC legislation"         │
│                                                                 │
│ Rationale:                                                      │
│ • CFC rules tax RESIDENTS (shareholders), not the CFC itself    │
│ • Article 1(3) preserves right to apply CFC legislation         │
│ • When read in "context", CFC rules not contrary to OECD MTC    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SWISS OBSERVATION:
Switzerland has made an Observation stating CFC rules may be
contrary to Article 7(1) depending on the "relevant concept"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. UK Diverted Profits Tax (DPT)

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **UK Government view** | DPT is a "separate and distinct tax" outside DTA scope |
| **HMRC position** | DPT not a "covered tax" for purposes of UK DTA network |
| **Criticism** | Substance over form suggests it targets same profits as income tax |
| **Treaty override?** | Disputed—depends on characterisation of DPT |

### 3. India Equalisation Levy

| Aspect | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Introduction** | Finance Act 2016; extended 2020 |
| **Scope** | Tax on digital advertising and e-commerce |
| **India's position** | Not under main income tax legislation; separate levy |
| **Critics** | Described as "alternative income tax" contravening PE concept |
| **Article 2 question** | Is EL an "identical or substantially similar tax"? |

### 4. Pillar Two and Treaty Compatibility

Emerging issue highlighted in exam solutions:

> "DTA compatibility with Pillar Two has been recently highlighted as an area of potential concern—the distributive rules for business profits in the DTA networks of countries may be at odds with Pillar Two allocation rules and has been described as 'extra-territorial'" (de Wilde, 2022)

---

## G. ALTERNATIVES TO TREATY OVERRIDE

The June 2023 exam solutions emphasised that override is **not the only option**:

| Alternative | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Bilateral consultation** | Engage treaty partner to address concerns |
| **Protocol negotiation** | Amend treaty through agreed protocol |
| **Multilateral coordination** | Address through Inclusive Framework or similar |
| **MLI modification** | Use multilateral instrument to update treaties |
| **Renegotiation** | Full treaty renegotiation (though slow) |

**Key Point**: "When significant cooperation between states occurs, it is possible to achieve fundamental, consensus-driven change" (Elliffe, 2022)—demonstrated by BEPS and MLI.
