# Chapter 14.1: Approaches to the Misuse of DTCs

## 1. Introduction and Conceptual Framework

### 1.1. Treaty Shopping and Treaty Abuse

Treaty shopping refers to the practice whereby residents of third states access treaty benefits by establishing entities in contracting states solely or primarily to obtain those benefits. A resident of Country A establishes a company in Country B to access the favourable provisions of a treaty between Country B and Country C, despite having no genuine economic connection to Country B beyond the interposed entity. This practice undermines the bilateral reciprocity underlying tax treaties—benefits negotiated between two states based on their particular economic relationships become available to residents of states that have not offered reciprocal concessions.

The distinction between legitimate tax planning and abusive treaty shopping has preoccupied international tax policymakers for decades. The OECD Preamble adopted in 2017 explicitly addresses this concern, stating that treaties are intended for "eliminating double taxation with respect to taxes covered by this agreement without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements)."

### 1.2. Forms of Treaty Misuse

Treaty abuse manifests in several forms beyond classic treaty shopping. Conduit arrangements involve interposing entities that receive income from one state and pass it to ultimate beneficiaries in another, capturing treaty benefits at the intermediate level. Base erosion strategies exploit treaty provisions to shift profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions through deductible payments. Rule shopping within treaties involves structuring transactions to access more favourable provisions than would otherwise apply—characterising royalties as business profits, for example, to avoid withholding taxes (covered in December 2023).

The common thread across these practices is the exploitation of treaty provisions in ways inconsistent with their intended purpose. Identifying abuse requires distinguishing legitimate structuring that happens to produce tax benefits from arrangements whose principal purpose is obtaining those benefits without genuine economic substance.

### 1.3. Evolution of Anti-Abuse Thinking

International approaches to treaty abuse have evolved significantly over decades. Early responses focused on beneficial ownership requirements in Articles 10-12, limiting treaty benefits to those who genuinely receive and enjoy income rather than acting as conduits. The United States developed detailed Limitation on Benefits provisions from the 1980s, establishing objective criteria for treaty entitlement.

The OECD progressively strengthened Commentary guidance, culminating in the 2003 revisions addressing conduit companies. The BEPS Project represented a paradigm shift, establishing minimum standards for treaty abuse prevention that all Inclusive Framework members must implement. The 2017 OECD Model introduced comprehensive anti-abuse provisions, and the Multilateral Instrument facilitated rapid implementation across the global treaty network.

## 2. Pre-2017 Approaches to Treaty Abuse

### 2.1. Beneficial Ownership Doctrine

Before the BEPS reforms, the primary treaty-based mechanism against abuse was the beneficial ownership requirement embedded in Articles 10, 11, and 12. These provisions limit reduced withholding rates on dividends, interest, and royalties to payments whose beneficial owner is resident in the other contracting state. A recipient who acts merely as an agent, nominee, or conduit—obligated to pass income to third parties—is not the beneficial owner.

The Indofood case established that beneficial owner has an international fiscal meaning not derived from domestic law. The UK Court of Appeal held that a Mauritian SPV was not the beneficial owner of interest payments despite formal receipt, because it lacked the "full privilege to directly benefit from the income." The Prévost case in Canada developed a four-part test examining possession, use, risk, and control of funds to determine beneficial ownership status.

These cases demonstrated that beneficial ownership provides meaningful protection against simple conduit arrangements but struggles with sophisticated structures where intermediate entities have some discretion or interim use of funds.

### 2.2. US Limitation on Benefits Tradition

The United States pioneered detailed Limitation on Benefits provisions beginning with the 1981 US-Netherlands treaty negotiations. The US approach establishes objective criteria defining persons entitled to treaty benefits, avoiding subjective intent inquiries. The current US Model contains comprehensive LOB provisions requiring taxpayers to satisfy one of several qualifying categories: individuals, governments, publicly traded companies, pension funds, or entities meeting ownership and base erosion tests.

This rules-based approach offers legal certainty—taxpayers can structure affairs knowing whether they qualify—but may permit sophisticated abuse that satisfies literal requirements while contradicting treaty purposes. It also creates compliance burdens requiring detailed ownership analysis and certification.

### 2.3. OECD Commentary Developments

The OECD Commentary evolved progressively to address treaty abuse. The 1986 Conduit Companies Report provided foundational principles for identifying abusive conduit arrangements. The 2003 Commentary revisions introduced sample anti-abuse provisions and expanded guidance on beneficial ownership. These developments reflected growing consensus that treaty benefits should not be available to those lacking genuine connection to contracting states.

However, pre-2017 Commentary provisions lacked binding force and were inconsistently implemented. Different states adopted varying anti-abuse measures, and many treaties contained no specific anti-abuse provisions beyond beneficial ownership requirements.

## 3. BEPS Action 6 Framework

### 3.1. The Minimum Standard

BEPS Action 6 established a minimum standard requiring Inclusive Framework members to implement measures preventing treaty abuse. The minimum standard has three components: a clear statement in treaty preambles that treaties are not intended to create opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through abuse; specific anti-abuse provisions; and coordination through peer review to ensure consistent implementation.

The minimum standard represented a significant advancement from voluntary Commentary guidance to mandatory implementation with monitoring. By establishing consensus on minimum requirements, BEPS Action 6 created momentum for comprehensive treaty network reform (covered in June 2024).

### 3.2. Three Implementation Options

BEPS Action 6 provides three options for meeting the minimum standard. The first option—adopted by the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions—is the Principal Purpose Test alone. The PPT provides flexibility through a standards-based approach applicable to all forms of treaty abuse.

The second option combines the PPT with a simplified Limitation on Benefits provision. This hybrid approach provides categorical certainty through LOB while retaining PPT as a backstop against sophisticated abuse that satisfies LOB requirements technically while contradicting treaty purposes.

The third option, reflecting the traditional US approach, combines detailed LOB provisions with specific anti-conduit rules but without the PPT. This purely rules-based approach offers maximum legal certainty but requires comprehensive provisions anticipating all potential abuse scenarios.

### 3.3. Preamble as Interpretive Tool

The mandatory preamble language serves interpretive functions beyond its declaratory purpose. Under Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties principles, a treaty's preamble forms part of its context for interpretation. The statement that treaties are not intended to create opportunities for abuse through treaty shopping provides authoritative guidance for interpreting all treaty provisions and exercising discretionary powers.

The preamble supports denying benefits in borderline cases where specific provisions are ambiguous. It also provides context for competent authority decisions regarding discretionary relief under LOB provisions.

## 4. Principal Purpose Test

### 4.1. Structure and Elements

The Principal Purpose Test in Article 29(9) of the OECD Model provides that treaty benefits shall not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction, unless granting the benefit would accord with the treaty's object and purpose. The test thus contains three key elements: a reasonableness standard, a principal purpose threshold, and an object and purpose exception.

The PPT applies broadly to any arrangement or transaction resulting directly or indirectly in treaty benefits. This encompasses not only the establishment of entities but also specific transactions, restructurings, and ongoing arrangements that produce treaty benefits.

### 4.2. The Reasonableness Standard

The "reasonable to conclude" language establishes an objective standard based on what a reasonable observer would conclude from available evidence. This is neither a subjective intent inquiry into taxpayer motivations nor a purely mechanical test. Authorities must examine objective circumstances including timing, commercial rationale, substance of entities involved, and alternatives to the structure adopted.

The initial burden rests on tax authorities to demonstrate that the reasonableness standard is satisfied. The SC Lowy case in India confirmed that authorities must provide cogent evidence supporting PPT application—structural arrangements alone, without evidence of abuse purpose, are insufficient. This burden allocation protects legitimate transactions from arbitrary denial of benefits.

### 4.3. Object and Purpose Exception

Even where obtaining treaty benefits was a principal purpose, benefits must be granted if doing so accords with the relevant provisions' object and purpose. This exception provides crucial protection for legitimate arrangements. A holding company that genuinely manages investments and adds value, though incorporated partly for tax efficiency, may still access treaty benefits if reduced withholding on dividends accords with the treaty's purpose of facilitating cross-border investment.

The exception shifts the burden to taxpayers to demonstrate consistency with object and purpose. The OECD Commentary provides examples, including situations where investments are made through holding structures for legitimate commercial reasons such as regulatory compliance or risk isolation.

## 5. Limitation on Benefits Provisions

### 5.1. Qualified Person Categories

Limitation on Benefits provisions establish categories of persons automatically entitled to treaty benefits. Individuals resident in a contracting state qualify automatically—their presence eliminates treaty shopping concerns. Governments, political subdivisions, and public entities similarly qualify. Publicly traded companies with shares regularly traded on recognised stock exchanges satisfy LOB requirements, as their dispersed ownership eliminates manipulation concerns.

Pension funds providing retirement benefits and non-profit organisations devoted to religious, charitable, educational, or scientific purposes qualify automatically. Other entities must satisfy ownership and base erosion tests—more than fifty percent ownership by qualified persons and less than fifty percent of gross income paid as deductible expenses to non-qualifying persons.

### 5.2. Active Business Test

Entities failing the qualified person tests may still access treaty benefits under the active business test. This provision recognises that genuine enterprises conducting substantial business in their residence state should not be denied benefits merely for failing ownership thresholds. The test requires substantial business activities in the residence state, with income derived in connection with or incidental to that business.

The activity in the source state must be substantial in relation to the source-state activity generating the income. A minor residence-state business cannot justify benefits on major source-state income. This proportionality requirement prevents token business activities from qualifying as genuine.

### 5.3. Derivative Benefits and Discretionary Relief

Derivative benefits provisions allow entities owned by "equivalent beneficiaries" to access treaty benefits. If seventy-five percent or more of shares are owned by persons who would be entitled to equal or better benefits under their own treaties with the source state, the entity qualifies. This recognises that treaty shopping concerns diminish where ultimate owners have equivalent treaty access.

Discretionary relief allows competent authorities to grant benefits to persons failing objective tests but demonstrating genuine connection to the residence state. This safety valve ensures legitimate arrangements are not denied benefits due to technical failures while preserving authority to deny benefits in abusive situations.

## 6. Interaction Between Mechanisms

### 6.1. Four-Layer Anti-Abuse Framework

The modern treaty framework employs multiple overlapping anti-abuse mechanisms. The first layer is the preamble statement providing interpretive context. The second layer is Article 1's requirement that persons be residents of contracting states. The third layer comprises beneficial ownership requirements in Articles 10-12. The fourth layer is Article 29's comprehensive PPT and LOB provisions.

These layers operate cumulatively. A person must be resident, must be the beneficial owner of relevant income, and must either satisfy LOB requirements or survive PPT scrutiny. Each layer addresses different aspects of potential abuse, creating comprehensive protection through overlapping mechanisms.

### 6.2. PPT and LOB Relationship

The relationship between PPT and LOB provisions remains subject to interpretation. Where both apply, questions arise whether LOB satisfaction creates a presumption of treaty entitlement or whether PPT can independently deny benefits to persons satisfying all LOB requirements. The Commentary suggests that LOB provisions themselves reflect treaty object and purpose, implying that LOB satisfaction should generally establish entitlement.

However, the PPT serves as a backstop against abuse unanticipated by LOB categories. Sophisticated arrangements satisfying LOB literally while contradicting treaty purposes remain subject to PPT denial. The Sixth Peer Review Report acknowledges ongoing interpretive development regarding this relationship.

## 7. Comparative Effectiveness

### 7.1. Rules-Based vs Standards-Based Approaches

The fundamental tension in anti-abuse design is between rules-based approaches offering legal certainty and standards-based approaches offering flexibility. Detailed LOB provisions establish clear criteria—taxpayers know whether they qualify without discretionary assessment. This facilitates planning and reduces disputes but creates opportunities for sophisticated avoidance satisfying literal requirements while undermining purposes.

The PPT's standards-based approach adapts to varied circumstances through case-by-case analysis. Authorities can address novel abuse schemes without specific provisions anticipating them. However, this flexibility creates uncertainty regarding outcomes, potentially chilling legitimate transactions where taxpayers cannot confidently predict results.

### 7.2. Legal Certainty vs Flexibility

Neither approach is inherently superior. The optimal choice depends on administrative capacity, treaty network characteristics, and policy priorities. Jurisdictions with sophisticated tax administrations and extensive treaty networks may prefer PPT flexibility. Those prioritising foreign investment may favour LOB certainty to reassure investors of stable treaty access.

The hybrid approach—LOB with PPT backstop—attempts to capture benefits of both, providing categorical certainty while retaining flexibility for unanticipated abuse. The vast majority of MLI signatories adopted PPT alone, suggesting preference for flexibility over detailed rules among most jurisdictions.

## 8. Jurisdictional Variations

### 8.1. US Approach

The United States has not signed the MLI and maintains its traditional detailed LOB approach in bilateral treaties. The 2016 US Model contains comprehensive Article 22 LOB provisions with objective tests for each qualifying category. The US preference for rules reflects concerns that subjective tests create uncertainty and may be applied unpredictably by foreign tax authorities.

Recent developments include the US-Chile treaty concluded in 2024—the first new US treaty in over fifteen years. US treaty policy continues to emphasise detailed LOB provisions rather than PPT adoption.

### 8.2. EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Framework

EU member states implement the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive alongside MLI participation. ATAD establishes mandatory anti-abuse rules including CFC provisions, interest limitation, hybrid mismatch rules, and exit taxation. ATAD III, expected from January 2026, introduces substance requirements targeting entities lacking genuine economic activity.

The three-part gateway test identifies entities with predominantly passive income, primarily cross-border transactions, and outsourced operations. Such entities must demonstrate minimum substance indicators—own premises, active bank accounts, and qualified personnel—or face denial of tax residence certificates and treaty benefits (covered in December 2024).

### 8.3. Developing Country Perspectives

Developing countries have particular concerns regarding treaty abuse. As capital-importing nations, they face revenue losses when residence-state investors route investments through conduit jurisdictions to access favourable treaties. The UN Model provides simplified provisions appropriate to developing country administrative capacity.

India's experience illustrates developing country responses. The India-Mauritius treaty was historically exploited for capital gains exemptions, leading to 2016 renegotiation introducing source taxation and subsequent protocol incorporating PPT. India's GAAR provisions can override treaty benefits where arrangements lack genuine business purpose, reflecting assertive protection of source-country tax base.

## 9. Recent Developments and Case Law

### 9.1. MLI Implementation

The Multilateral Instrument has achieved remarkable coverage since entering force on 1 July 2018. As of November 2025, 105 jurisdictions have signed the MLI, covering approximately 2,000 bilateral treaties. The Sixth Peer Review Report confirms over 1,120 agreements between Inclusive Framework members are now compliant with the minimum standard—a thirty percent increase in compliant agreements between 2022 and 2023 alone.

PPT adoption through the MLI represents the dominant approach—ninety-nine or more signatories chose PPT to satisfy the minimum standard. This consensus on a standards-based mechanism represents significant convergence across diverse legal traditions and policy preferences. The rapid implementation contrasts with historical treaty reform, which required renegotiating thousands of bilateral agreements individually.

### 9.2. Emerging Jurisprudence

Case law interpreting the PPT and related provisions continues to develop. The SC Lowy case established that Indian tax authorities bear the burden of demonstrating PPT application and cannot presume abuse from structural arrangements alone. The CBDT Circular 1/2025 clarified that PPT applies prospectively, with shares acquired before April 2017 grandfathered from PPT scrutiny.

The Danish Supreme Court's Cook Denmark decision applied multi-tier conduit analysis to beneficial ownership questions. Swiss Federal Supreme Court decisions have refined beneficial ownership standards for financial instruments, holding that investment-specific risk-bearing supports beneficial owner status even where other risks are transferred through derivatives.

These decisions demonstrate that courts are engaging substantively with anti-abuse provisions, developing practical standards for their application while protecting legitimate arrangements from overbroad denial of benefits.
