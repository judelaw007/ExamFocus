# Chapter 11.2: Dividends – Article 10, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Policy Rationale

### 1.1. The Role of Article 10

Article 10 allocates taxing rights over dividend income between the source state (where the paying company is resident) and the residence state (where the recipient is resident). Unlike Article 6 which permits unlimited source taxation for immovable property income, Article 10 uses a shared allocation approach with limited source taxation through capped withholding tax rates.

Dividends represent passive income—the recipient does not participate directly in the activity generating the income. This characteristic distinguishes dividend income from business profits under Article 7 (active income requiring a permanent establishment threshold) and employment income under Article 15. The passive nature influences the allocation approach, permitting source taxation but at limited rates.

### 1.2. Policy Rationale for Shared Allocation

The OECD Commentary explains that taxation of dividends exclusively in the source state is not acceptable as a general rule, nor is exclusive residence taxation feasible. The compromise solution permits both states to tax, with the source state's right limited to specified withholding tax rates while the residence state has unlimited taxing rights but must provide double taxation relief.

Several factors justify source state taxation. Dividends derive from company profits earned in the source state, where infrastructure and services supported profit generation. Historical practice supports some source taxation, reflecting the economic connection between the dividend-paying company and its country of residence. However, unlimited source taxation would create excessive double taxation burdens discouraging cross-border investment, justifying the rate limitations.

### 1.3. Historical Development

The allocation of dividend taxing rights has evolved significantly. The 1927 League of Nations Report provided for unlimited source taxation based on the real centre of management. The 1943 Mexico Draft similarly permitted unlimited source taxation where capital was invested. The 1946 London Draft shifted toward exclusive residence taxation for inter-company dividends involving dominant participation, while prohibiting extraterritorial taxation. The 1963 OECD Model adopted the current shared approach with limited source taxation, which has remained the fundamental structure since. The June 2022 examination tested this historical development.

## 2. Treaty Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 10(1): Residence State Right

Article 10(1) provides: "Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

This grants the residence state the right to tax dividends without limitation. The language "may be taxed" creates permission rather than obligation—the residence state has the right but is not required to exercise it. The provision requires the paying company to be resident in one Contracting State and the recipient to be resident in the other, ensuring bilateral application only to cross-border dividends within the treaty relationship.

### 2.2. Article 10(2): Source State Right

Article 10(2) permits source state taxation but limits the rates: "However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends throughout a 365 day period that includes the day of the payment of the dividend... (b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases."

The five percent rate applies to direct investment where the beneficial owner is a company holding at least 25 percent of capital throughout a 365-day period including the payment date. This lower rate encourages foreign direct investment by reducing the tax burden on inter-company dividends, recognising that such dividends are often subject to participation exemptions domestically. The fifteen percent rate applies to portfolio investment in all other cases, including individual shareholders and companies with smaller or shorter-duration holdings.

### 2.3. Subsequent Paragraphs

Article 10(3) defines "dividends" for treaty purposes, using a dual approach combining treaty-autonomous elements with domestic law reference. Article 10(4) provides the permanent establishment exception, displacing Article 10 in favour of Article 7 where dividends are effectively connected with a PE. Article 10(5) prohibits extraterritorial taxation—a state cannot tax dividends merely because profits originated there, nor impose special taxes on undistributed profits of non-resident companies.

## 3. The Beneficial Owner Requirement

### 3.1. Purpose and Function

The beneficial owner requirement serves as an anti-avoidance mechanism preventing treaty shopping through conduit arrangements. Without this requirement, a third-country investor could interpose a resident of a Contracting State to receive dividends and pass them on, claiming reduced withholding tax rates despite the ultimate investor having no treaty entitlement.

The beneficial owner concept requires more than mere legal ownership. The Commentary clarifies that the beneficial owner must have the full right to use and enjoy the dividend, must not be acting as agent, nominee, or conduit, and must not be under contractual or legal obligation to pass the payment to another person. A substance-over-form approach applies, examining economic reality rather than formal legal arrangements.

### 3.2. Recent Case Law Developments

French courts addressed beneficial ownership in November 2024, ruling that the absence of a beneficial owner clause in a treaty does not prevent tax authorities from refusing treaty benefits to recipients who are only "apparent beneficiaries." Where a dividend recipient cannot be regarded as the beneficial owner, the treaty cannot be applied to that income regardless of whether the treaty text includes explicit beneficial ownership language.

UK developments in 2025 have strengthened beneficial ownership requirements in withholding tax compliance. HMRC now expects beneficial owners to have meaningful presence in their home countries, including offices, local employees, and decision-making authority. Without these substance elements, treaty benefits may be denied. This aligns with OECD standards emphasising that pass-through entities or agents acting on behalf of others may not qualify as beneficial owners even if technically resident in a treaty state.

### 3.3. The 365-Day Holding Period

The 2017 OECD Model addition requires the 25 percent holding to be maintained throughout a 365-day period including the dividend payment date to qualify for the five percent rate. This prevents dividend stripping transactions where an investor acquires shares shortly before a dividend, claims reduced withholding tax, and sells shortly afterward. Some countries have reserved the right not to include this holding period requirement in their treaties.

## 4. Definition of Dividends

### 4.1. Treaty Definition

Article 10(3) adopts a dual approach to defining dividends. The treaty-autonomous elements include income from shares, income from jouissance shares or rights, income from mining shares, income from founders' shares, and other rights participating in profits that are not debt-claims. Additionally, dividends include other income subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares under the domestic law of the company's residence state.

This broad definition accommodates the significant differences between domestic laws in characterising corporate distributions. The domestic law reference catches deemed dividends, constructive dividends, and other distributions that domestic law treats as equivalent to share income.

### 4.2. Characterisation Issues

The December 2025 examination addressed characterisation between dividends, interest, and hybrid instruments. The distinction between debt and equity determines whether a payment falls under Article 10 (dividends) or Article 11 (interest). Hybrid instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity require careful analysis of the payment's legal and economic nature under applicable domestic law.

## 5. Permanent Establishment Exception

### 5.1. Article 10(4) Operation

Article 10(4) provides that where dividends are paid in respect of holdings effectively connected with a permanent establishment, Articles 10(1) and (2) do not apply. Instead, Article 7 governs and the income is treated as business profits attributable to the PE.

Effective connection requires more than merely recording the shareholding in the PE's books. There must be genuine business connection: the shareholding must be held for PE business purposes, the PE must manage or administer the investment, and economic nexus must exist between the shares and PE activities. When effectively connected, the source state is not limited to reduced withholding rates but may tax the dividend as part of PE profits at full corporate rates.

### 5.2. UN Model Extension

The UN Model extends the PE exception to include fixed bases for independent personal services under UN Article 14. This broader scope reflects the UN Model's retention of the fixed base concept.

## 6. UN Model Differences

### 6.1. Key Distinctions

The UN Model differs from the OECD Model in several significant respects for dividend taxation. Most fundamentally, the UN Model does not specify withholding tax rates, leaving them to bilateral negotiation. The UN Commentary explains that OECD rates are not considered appropriate maximum rates as they may result in too much lost revenue for developing countries.

The ownership threshold for the reduced direct investment rate is ten percent in the UN Model compared to twenty-five percent in the OECD Model. This lower threshold reflects that in some developing countries non-residents are limited to fifty percent share ownership, making ten percent a significant holding in relative terms.

### 6.2. Developing Country Perspective

Developing countries are typically capital importers, meaning foreign investment generates dividends flowing outward to residence states. Low withholding tax rates transfer tax revenue from source (developing) countries to residence (developed) countries. The UN Model allows negotiation of rates appropriate to bilateral economic circumstances, with typical developing country rates ranging from five to fifteen percent for inter-company dividends and fifteen to twenty-five percent for portfolio dividends.

The 2025 UN Model update introduced a subject to tax rule denying treaty benefits for income subject to no or very low taxation in the residence country. This protects source country taxing rights when income is not meaningfully taxed elsewhere, addressing situations where reduced source taxation produces double non-taxation rather than eliminating double taxation.

### 6.3. The Reciprocity Problem

The OECD Model assumes reciprocity between contracting states, but reciprocity requires parties capable of providing and forsaking broadly similar levels of resources. Capital-importing developing countries and capital-exporting developed countries have fundamentally different positions, with dividends flowing predominantly from developing to developed countries. Withholding tax limitations primarily benefit residence countries, creating structural revenue transfer from source to residence states.

## 7. Key States' Approaches

### 7.1. United States

The United States imposes thirty percent withholding tax on dividends paid to non-residents under domestic law. The US Model Tax Convention, like the UN Model, does not specify withholding tax rates, leaving them to bilateral negotiation. Typical US treaty rates are fifteen percent for portfolio dividends and five percent or zero for substantial holdings, often requiring ten percent or greater ownership.

The United States does not provide tax sparing credits in its treaties. Post-2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reforms introduced a participation exemption under Section 245A for certain foreign dividends, moving toward territorial treatment for US multinationals' foreign earnings.

In December 2024, the US and Swiss Competent Authorities entered into an arrangement identifying pension plans qualifying for dividend exemption under Article 10(3) of the US-Swiss treaty, effective retroactively to dividends paid from 1 January 2020.

### 7.2. United Kingdom

The United Kingdom generally does not impose withholding tax on ordinary dividends paid to non-residents under domestic law, creating a zero percent source rate without need for treaty relief. The exception is Property Income Distributions by UK REITs, subject to twenty percent withholding (increasing to twenty-two percent from April 2027) but eligible for treaty reduction.

Because the UK has no general dividend withholding tax, UK treaties often provide for exclusive residence taxation. The practical effect is that Article 10 limitations are moot for UK-source dividends except for REIT distributions. Post-Brexit, the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive no longer applies, requiring reliance on bilateral treaties for dividends to EU parent companies.

### 7.3. Germany

Germany imposes 26.375 percent withholding tax on dividends (25 percent plus 5.5 percent solidarity surcharge). Treaty rates vary, typically fifteen percent standard with reduced rates of ten percent, five percent, or zero for substantial holdings depending on treaty terms.

Germany provides a ninety-five percent participation exemption for inbound dividends, requiring minimum ten percent shareholding for corporate income tax purposes and fifteen percent for trade tax. The effective tax burden on qualifying dividends is approximately 1.6 percent. Under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, zero percent withholding applies to dividends paid to EU parent companies with ten percent or greater holdings maintained for at least twelve months.

### 7.4. France

France imposes twenty-five percent withholding tax on dividends to non-resident corporate shareholders and 12.8 percent to non-resident individual shareholders as of 1 January 2025. Payments to non-cooperative states or territories face seventy-five percent withholding. Treaty rates are typically fifteen percent standard with five percent for substantial corporate holdings of ten percent or more.

France provides a ninety-five percent participation exemption (ninety-nine percent in certain cases) for inbound dividends, requiring minimum five percent shareholding with two-year holding period or commitment to hold. The EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive provides zero percent withholding for qualifying EU distributions with ten percent minimum holding for two years.

## 8. Alternative Approaches

### 8.1. Exclusive Source Taxation

Some treaties provide exclusive source taxation without limitation, notably the 1971 Andean Model Article 11. The source state has the exclusive right to tax with no rate limitation, and the residence state must exempt. This approach maximises source country revenue but may discourage investment.

### 8.2. Exclusive Residence Taxation

Other treaties provide exclusive residence taxation with zero percent source withholding, such as certain provisions in the Egypt/France and Finland/UK treaties. This eliminates source taxation entirely, simplifying compliance but foregoing source country revenue.

### 8.3. Pension Fund Exemption

The OECD Commentary suggests pension funds and similar institutions should be exempt from source state taxation on dividends. This mirrors tax treatment in residence states where pension funds are typically exempt, avoiding economic double taxation where withholding tax is not creditable against exempt income. The December 2024 US-Swiss arrangement exemplifies this approach for qualifying pension plans.

## 9. Double Taxation Relief

### 9.1. Credit and Exemption Methods

The credit method under Article 23B allows the residence state to tax worldwide income including dividends but grants credit for source state withholding tax. The ordinary credit limitation prevents the credit exceeding residence state tax on the foreign income, avoiding refunds of excess foreign tax.

The exemption method under Article 23A exempts foreign dividend income from residence state taxation. This may be more beneficial for developing countries as source states can freely set tax rates without residence states capturing benefits through reduced credits.

### 9.2. Tax Sparing

Tax sparing credits cover tax incentives offered by source states as if tax had actually been paid. This preserves the benefit of source country incentives for investors. The OECD view is that tax sparing is neither effective nor efficient, and only limited time-bound sparing should be permitted. The United States does not include tax sparing in its treaties.

## 10. Recent Developments

### 10.1. EU Withholding Tax Directive (December 2024)

EU Council Directive 2025/50 of 10 December 2024 establishes streamlined procedures for withholding tax relief across EU member states. The directive references beneficial ownership declarations in accordance with OECD Commentary on Articles 10 and 11, incorporating international standards into EU procedural requirements. Implementation will harmonise relief procedures for cross-border dividend payments within the EU.

### 10.2. Principal Purpose Test Application

The Principal Purpose Test introduced under BEPS Action 6 and implemented through the MLI continues to evolve. UK HMRC guidance in 2025 emphasises that to qualify for reduced dividend withholding under treaties, claimants must demonstrate genuine substance including local offices, employees, and decision-making capability. This strengthens anti-avoidance beyond the beneficial owner concept alone.

### 10.3. Treaty Network Expansion

The global treaty network has expanded significantly, growing from approximately 1,008 treaties in 1990 to nearly 4,850 in 2024 across 144 jurisdictions. However, expansion has slowed in recent years with only 294 additional treaties during 2017-2024, suggesting the network is approaching maturity for major trading relationships. This extensive network means that cross-border dividend payments between most significant trading partners now benefit from reduced withholding tax rates under applicable treaties, though the specific rates and conditions vary considerably depending on the bilateral relationship and the parties' negotiating positions at the time of treaty conclusion.
