# Chapter 2.1: Incorporation of DTCs into Domestic Law

---

## 1. The Relationship Between DTCs and Domestic Law

### 1.1. The Fundamental Question

Double taxation conventions (DTCs) are instruments of **public international law** negotiated between sovereign states. However, taxpayers and tax administrations operate under **domestic law**. This creates a fundamental question:

> How does a DTC, as an instrument of international law, become applicable within a state's domestic legal system?

The answer varies significantly between states and directly impacts whether taxpayers can invoke treaty benefits in domestic courts, whether domestic legislation can override treaty obligations, and how courts interpret and apply DTC provisions.

### 1.2. The Dual Nature of DTCs

DTCs possess a dual nature that candidates must appreciate. As noted in authoritative tax treaty scholarship, DTCs function simultaneously as international contracts binding states under international law and as instruments within domestic law creating rights for taxpayers.

| Dimension | Character | Governing Framework |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **International** | Contract between sovereign states | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) |
| **Domestic** | Incorporated into national law | Each state's constitutional framework |

This dual nature has been examined in the context of discussions about treaty override and the interaction between international obligations and domestic sovereignty. *(covered in June 2023)*

## 2. Theoretical Frameworks: Monism and Dualism

Understanding the monist-dualist distinction is essential for analysing how different jurisdictions approach treaty incorporation. This distinction is not merely academic—it has profound practical consequences for taxpayers seeking to rely on treaty benefits and for states seeking to protect their tax base. The theoretical framework a country adopts shapes the entire relationship between its international commitments and domestic fiscal policy, affecting questions ranging from whether a taxpayer can directly invoke treaty provisions in court to whether Parliament can unilaterally override treaty obligations.

### 2.1. Monist Systems

#### 2.1.1. Definition and Characteristics

Monist systems view international law and domestic law as intrinsically part of the **same legal system**. Under this approach, international law does not need to be translated into national law—the act of ratifying an international treaty immediately incorporates that international law into national law.

The key characteristics of monist systems include:

- Treaty becomes part of domestic law upon ratification
- No separate transformation or implementing legislation required
- Courts can directly apply treaty provisions
- Treaty typically ranks above ordinary domestic legislation
- International law treated as **lex specialis** (special law taking priority)

In states with a monist system, the principle **lex specialis derogat legi generali** applies, meaning that the special law of treaties overrides the general domestic tax law that is effective at the time of their implementation. Additionally, under the supplementary rule **lex posterior generalis non derogat legi priori speciali**, later general legislation does not overrule earlier special legislation, meaning that changes to domestic tax law normally will not affect existing treaties.

#### 2.1.2. Country Examples

| Country | Constitutional Basis | Practical Effect |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Netherlands** | Treaties can be directly invoked if self-executing | Treaties prevail over conflicting domestic legislation |
| **France** | Article 55 of Constitution | Treaties have superior status to domestic law |
| **Switzerland** | Federal Constitution | International treaties directly applicable; courts give them precedence |
| **Belgium** | Monist tradition | Treaties have primacy over domestic legislation |

### 2.2. Dualist Systems

#### 2.2.1. Definition and Characteristics

Dualist systems view international law and domestic law as **separate regimes of law**. According to this approach, international law does not automatically become part of the domestic legal system and requires a specific act of incorporation by the domestic legislature.

The key characteristics of dualist systems include:

- Treaty has no domestic effect until formally incorporated
- Requires implementing legislation to transform treaty into domestic law
- It is the **legislative act**, not the treaty itself, that changes domestic law
- Parliament can amend implementing legislation at any time
- **Lex posterior derogat legi priori** may apply (later law overrides earlier law)

Under the dualist approach, the principle **lex posterior derogat legi priori** (a later law repeals the former law) applies to ordinary domestic law, meaning the legislature can unilaterally introduce rules that deviate from earlier provisions in a tax treaty.

#### 2.2.2. Country Examples

| Country | Implementation Mechanism | Features |
|---------|-------------------------|----------|
| **United Kingdom** | Order in Council under TIOPA 2010 | Treaty-making is royal prerogative; Parliament must enact implementing legislation |
| **Australia** | Parliamentary legislation | Executive concludes treaties; require parliamentary implementation |
| **Canada** | Federal implementing legislation | Federal treaties require legislative implementation |
| **India** | Legislative implementation | Treaties require parliamentary approval |

### 2.3. Mixed Systems: The United States

The United States presents a hybrid approach that does not fit neatly into either category:

- Treaties are "supreme law of the land" under Article VI of the Constitution
- Critical distinction between **self-executing** and **non-self-executing** treaties
- Self-executing treaties have direct domestic effect without implementing legislation
- Non-self-executing treaties require Congressional implementation
- Tax treaties are generally considered self-executing once the Senate gives advice and consent
- However, Congress can override treaties by subsequent legislation—the lex posterior principle applies

The constitutional framework places treaties and federal statutes on equal footing. As the US Supreme Court held in *Whitney v. Robertson* (1888), when a treaty and statute conflict, "the one last in date will control the other, provided always the stipulation of the treaty on the subject is self-executing."

### 2.4. Comparative Summary

| Feature | Monist | Dualist | US (Mixed) |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Automatic domestic effect** | Yes | No | Depends on self-executing status |
| **Implementing legislation needed** | No | Yes | Only for non-self-executing treaties |
| **Treaty rank vs domestic law** | Usually superior | Same as implementing statute | Equal to federal statute |
| **Override by later legislation** | Generally not possible | Yes | Yes (Congress can override) |
| **Direct court application** | Yes | Only via implementing law | If self-executing |

## 3. Constitutional Approaches to Treaty Implementation

The OECD notes that incorporation approaches depend largely on each state's constitutional framework. The degree of legislative involvement in treaty-making varies significantly. These constitutional differences reflect deeper philosophical choices about the balance between executive power and parliamentary sovereignty, and about the relationship between international cooperation and domestic democratic accountability. A state's constitutional approach to treaties is rarely neutral—it embodies judgments about where ultimate authority should lie and how binding international commitments should be on future legislatures.

### 3.1. Executive-Led Systems: The UK Model

In the United Kingdom, treaty-making is a prerogative of the Crown. The key features of the UK approach include:

**Step 1: Negotiation and Conclusion**
HMRC is empowered to negotiate and conclude DTCs. No parliamentary approval is required for the conclusion of a treaty.

**Step 2: Parliamentary Implementation**
Parliament enacts an Order in Council under the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act (TIOPA) 2010. Section 2 of TIOPA 2010 provides the power to make Orders in Council implementing DTCs. Section 6 of TIOPA 2010 provides that where the terms of a DTC have been incorporated into law via a statutory instrument, they take effect "despite anything in any enactment."

**Step 3: Application**
UK courts apply DTC provisions via the implementing legislation. DTC provisions are interpreted in light of VCLT principles. Parliamentary sovereignty theoretically allows override, but the UK has generally respected treaty obligations.

### 3.2. Legislative Approval Systems: The US Model

Under the US constitutional framework:

- The President negotiates treaties
- The Senate must give **advice and consent** (two-thirds majority required)
- Once ratified, a treaty becomes "supreme law of the land" under Article VI, Clause 2
- Tax treaties are generally considered **self-executing**
- However, Congress can override by later legislation, applying lex posterior

This approach involves greater legislative involvement in the treaty-making process. The treaty has direct domestic effect once ratified, but is not immune from Congressional override.

### 3.3. Parliamentary Approval Before Ratification

In countries such as the Netherlands and France:

- Treaties require parliamentary approval **before** ratification
- Once approved and ratified, they have direct domestic legal effect
- Treaties rank above domestic legislation
- Courts can disapply conflicting domestic laws

This approach ensures democratic legitimacy while maintaining treaty supremacy.

## 4. The Vienna Convention Framework

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), which entered into force on 27 January 1980, provides the foundational framework for treaty obligations under international law. The VCLT represents the international community's attempt to codify the fundamental principles governing how treaties should be made, interpreted, and observed. For tax practitioners, the VCLT matters because it establishes the baseline expectations that states have of each other when entering into DTCs—expectations that can come into tension with domestic constitutional arrangements that permit treaty override.

### 4.1. Pacta Sunt Servanda (Article 26)

Article 26 of the VCLT embodies the fundamental principle of treaty law:

> "Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith."

This principle, known as **pacta sunt servanda**, has two elements:

1. **Agreements must be kept**: Contracting states enter a mutual obligation to respect and apply DTC provisions
2. **Agreements must be kept in good faith**: States must take the necessary steps to comply with the object and purpose of the DTC

### 4.2. Internal Law Limitations (Article 27)

Article 27 of the VCLT reinforces the binding nature of treaties:

> "A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty."

This provision makes clear that a contracting state may not rely on restrictions imposed by domestic law as a reason for non-compliance with treaty obligations. However, the practical application of this principle varies depending on each state's constitutional approach to treaty incorporation.

### 4.3. Treaty Interpretation (Articles 31-32)

Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT provide rules for treaty interpretation:

- **Article 31**: Treaty terms shall be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of terms in their context, and in light of the treaty's object and purpose
- **Article 32**: Supplementary means of interpretation (including preparatory work and the circumstances of conclusion) may be used to confirm meaning or determine meaning where Article 31 leaves it ambiguous

These interpretation rules apply to DTCs and inform how domestic courts approach treaty provisions.

## 5. Practical Implications for DTC Application

### 5.1. Self-Executing vs Non-Self-Executing Treaties

This distinction is particularly important in mixed systems. The test for self-execution considers:

- Does the provision create rights or obligations directly applicable by courts?
- Is the provision sufficiently precise and complete?
- Did the contracting states intend direct application?

| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Self-executing** | Provisions sufficiently precise to be applied directly by courts without implementing legislation | Most DTC distributive rules (Articles 6-21) |
| **Non-self-executing** | Provisions require domestic implementation to be operative | Some procedural provisions; provisions referencing domestic law |

### 5.2. Effect on Taxpayer Rights

The incorporation approach directly affects whether taxpayers can invoke treaty benefits:

| System | Can taxpayers directly invoke DTC? | Conditions |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| **Monist** | Yes, in court proceedings | Treaty must be in force and ratified |
| **Dualist** | Yes, via implementing legislation | Implementing legislation must be enacted |
| **US (Mixed)** | Yes, if self-executing | Senate consent obtained; provisions sufficiently precise |

### 5.3. The Article 3(2) Mechanism

Article 3(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides an important mechanism linking DTCs to domestic law:

> "As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State."

This provision establishes the **ambulatory approach** (clarified by the 1995 OECD amendment): the meaning of undefined terms is determined at the time of application of the DTC, not at the time the DTC was signed. This allows treaties to accommodate changes in domestic law without the need to renegotiate the treaty.

Some scholars argue that Article 3(2) creates a form of "built-in" treaty override, as domestic law meanings can change over time and affect treaty interpretation. However, the "unless the context otherwise requires" qualifier provides a safeguard against domestic law interpretations that would undermine the treaty's object and purpose.

## 6. The OECD Perspective

### 6.1. Recognition of Domestic Diversity

The OECD acknowledges the diversity of approaches to treaty incorporation. As stated in OECD materials:

> "Treaty override depends to a large extent on each state's legal system, how, and at what level, international law treaties, customary law, and general principles is placed at the domestic level."

The level attributed to DTC obligations in domestic law determines whether derogations are unconstitutional or permitted.

### 6.2. The 1989 Recommendation on Treaty Override

The **OECD Recommendation of the Council concerning Tax Treaty Override** (OECD/LEGAL/0253), adopted on 2 October 1989, defines treaty override as:

> "A situation where the domestic legislation of a State overrules provisions of either a single treaty or all treaties hitherto having had effect in that State."

The OECD recommends that States "avoid enacting legislation which is intended to have effects in clear contradiction to international treaty obligations." The 1989 Report categorised various situations of treaty override as acceptable and unacceptable behaviour for governments, establishing a normative framework that continues to influence international tax practice.

The tension identified in the 1989 Recommendation has become more acute in recent years. The increasing use of domestic anti-avoidance measures and the unilateral introduction of digital services taxes have raised fresh questions about the boundary between legitimate domestic policy-making and impermissible treaty override. While the multilateral approach embodied in the MLI and Pillars One and Two represents one response to this tension—seeking coordinated rather than unilateral action—the fundamental challenge of balancing domestic sovereignty with international commitments remains unresolved.

## 7. Key Cases and Judicial Approaches

The interaction between DTCs and domestic law has generated significant judicial consideration across jurisdictions. The cases examined below illustrate how courts in different constitutional systems have grappled with the fundamental question of what happens when treaty obligations and domestic legislation point in different directions. These decisions are not merely of historical interest—they establish the legal framework within which current tax planning and disputes must be analysed.

### 7.1. Whitney v. Robertson (USA, 1888)

The US Supreme Court decision in *Whitney v. Robertson*, 124 U.S. 190 (1888), is foundational for understanding the American approach to treaty override. The Court held:

> "By the Constitution, a treaty is placed on the same footing, and made of like obligation, with an act of legislation. Both are declared by that instrument to be the supreme law of the land, and no superior efficacy is given to either over the other."

The Court established that when a treaty and statute conflict and cannot be reconciled, "the one last in date will control the other." This **later-in-time rule** remains the governing principle in US law, despite being in tension with Articles 26 and 27 of the VCLT.

### 7.2. BVerfG Decision (Germany, 2015)

In its decision of 15 December 2015 (2 BvL 1/12), the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) confirmed that treaty override is constitutionally permissible in Germany. The case concerned section 50d(8) of the German Income Tax Act, which required taxpayers to prove that income had been taxed abroad before claiming treaty relief.

The Court held that:

- Tax treaties do not rank superior to ordinary domestic law
- The lex posterior derogat legi priori principle applies
- The principle of democracy requires that Parliament be free to change its mind and amend laws, even if this violates an international treaty ratified by a previous Parliament
- The constitutional principle of openness to international law does not impose an unrestricted duty to comply with all rules of international law

This decision confirmed Germany's dualist approach to treaty incorporation despite its tradition of friendliness towards international law.

### 7.3. Lamesa Holdings (Australia, 1997)

*Lamesa Holdings BV v Commissioner of Taxation* [1997] FCA 134 is a significant Australian decision concerning treaty interpretation and the interaction between DTCs and domestic law. The Full Federal Court of Australia examined Article 13 of the Australia-Netherlands DTC regarding capital gains from the alienation of shares.

The case established important principles for treaty interpretation in Australia, including the use of OECD Commentary as an interpretive aid. The subsequent legislative response to Lamesa has been described by scholars as an example of "Australia's tax treaty override," demonstrating how even dualist jurisdictions with implementing legislation may face tension between domestic policy objectives and treaty obligations.
