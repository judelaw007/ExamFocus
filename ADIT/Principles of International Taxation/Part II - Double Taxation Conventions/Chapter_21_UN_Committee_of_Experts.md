## Chapter 21: The Work of the UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters

### 1. Introduction and Historical Background

#### 1.1. Origins and Establishment

The United Nations Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters traces its origins to 1968, when the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) established the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on Tax Treaties between Developed and Developing Countries pursuant to Resolution 1273 (XLIII) of 4 August 1967. This initiative responded to developing country concerns that the existing international tax framework, shaped primarily by developed country practice, inadequately addressed their needs and circumstances.

The Ad Hoc Group's initial mandate focused on developing model tax treaty provisions suitable for agreements between developed and developing countries. This work culminated in 1980 with publication of the first United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries, providing an alternative to the OECD Model that gave greater weight to source country taxation rights.

The transformation from an ad hoc group to a standing committee reflected the growing complexity and importance of international tax cooperation. In 2004, ECOSOC Resolution 2004/69 reconstituted the body as the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, establishing its current mandate and structure. This resolution recognized that developing countries required ongoing engagement with international tax issues rather than periodic ad hoc attention.

#### 1.2. Evolution of the Committee's Mandate

The Committee's mandate has expanded significantly from its original focus on model treaty provisions. Under Resolution 2004/69, the Committee is responsible for keeping the UN Model Convention and the Manual for the Negotiation of Bilateral Tax Treaties under review and updating them as necessary. Beyond these core documents, the Committee provides a framework for dialogue to enhance international tax cooperation among national tax authorities.

The mandate explicitly directs the Committee to consider how new and emerging issues affect international tax cooperation and to develop assessments, commentaries, and recommendations. This forward-looking responsibility enables the Committee to address developments such as digitalization and environmental taxation that were not contemplated when the original mandate was established.

Critically, the mandate emphasizes capacity building and technical assistance for developing countries and economies in transition. The Committee gives special attention to least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries—jurisdictions facing particular challenges in building effective tax systems.

### 2. Structure and Governance

#### 2.1. Membership Composition

The Committee comprises 25 members nominated by governments and appointed by the Secretary-General for four-year terms. Members serve in their personal expert capacity rather than as governmental representatives, though their nominations reflect government confidence in their expertise. This personal capacity service enables technical discussion unburdened by immediate political positioning, while government nomination ensures that members possess relevant practical experience.

Membership reflects equitable geographical distribution across regions and balance between developed and developing country perspectives. The composition deliberately includes more representatives from developing countries than developed countries, reversing the balance that characterizes the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs. Members are drawn from tax policy and tax administration backgrounds, ensuring both policy and operational perspectives inform Committee work.

Gender balance in membership has received increasing attention in recent appointment cycles, reflecting broader UN commitments to gender equality in expert bodies. The current membership term covers 2021-2025.

#### 2.2. Sessions and Working Methods

The Committee meets twice annually for four-day sessions, typically in April or May at UN Headquarters in New York and in October at the UN Office in Geneva. This schedule, established in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, ensures regular engagement while respecting the part-time nature of member service.

Sessions combine plenary discussions with consideration of subcommittee reports. The Committee approves final outputs, sets priorities for future work, and provides guidance to subcommittees. Sessions also include engagement with stakeholders, including civil society organizations, business representatives, and international organizations.

Between sessions, substantive work occurs in subcommittees. The Committee currently operates eleven subcommittees and four smaller working groups, each addressing specific thematic areas. Subcommittees typically include Committee members, additional experts who are not members, and representatives from other organizations. This multi-stakeholder composition brings diverse perspectives to technical work.

#### 2.3. Subcommittees and Working Groups

The subcommittee structure enables the Committee to address its broad mandate efficiently. Current subcommittees address areas including:

- **Article-by-Article** review and updating of the UN Model Convention
- **Dispute Avoidance and Resolution** mechanisms
- **Extractive Industries** taxation
- **Transfer Pricing** implementation and guidance
- **Taxation of the Digitalized and Globalized Economy**
- **Environmental Taxation** and fiscal measures
- **Mutual Administrative Assistance** in tax matters

Each subcommittee operates under terms of reference approved by the Committee and reports to the full Committee at each session. Subcommittee coordinators, typically Committee members, lead work between sessions. The Secretariat, provided by the Financing for Sustainable Development Office of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, supports subcommittee activities.

### 3. Key Outputs and Publications

#### 3.1. The UN Model Double Taxation Convention

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries represents the Committee's flagship publication. First issued in 1980 and subsequently updated in 2001, 2011, 2017, and 2021, the Model provides an alternative to the OECD Model that better reflects developing country perspectives on the allocation of taxing rights.

The UN Model differs from the OECD Model in several significant respects. It generally preserves greater source country taxation rights, reflecting developing country interests as typical capital importers. Key differences include lower thresholds for permanent establishment, broader service PE provisions, and Article 12A providing source taxation of technical service fees—a provision absent from the OECD Model.

The 2021 update introduced significant changes addressing digital economy taxation. New Article 12B permits source taxation of income from automated digital services, responding to developing country concerns about digitalized business models that generate value in jurisdictions where no physical presence exists. The update also addressed offshore indirect transfers, enabling source taxation of gains on sales of interests in entities deriving value from assets located in the source state.

Each Model article is accompanied by extensive commentary explaining the provision's purpose, operation, and relationship to other provisions. The commentaries provide authoritative interpretation guidance, though countries may adopt different positions in their bilateral negotiations.

#### 3.2. Manual for the Negotiation of Bilateral Tax Treaties

The Manual for the Negotiation of Bilateral Tax Treaties between Developed and Developing Countries provides practical guidance to tax treaty negotiators, particularly those with limited experience. The Manual was substantially updated in 2019 to reflect developments in international tax cooperation and emerging challenges.

The Manual addresses the entire treaty negotiation process. Section I introduces principles underlying double tax treaties, including residence and source concepts. Section II addresses strategic questions: whether to negotiate treaties, developing treaty policy frameworks, and practical steps before, during, and after negotiations. Section III provides article-by-article guidance on the UN Model Convention, supplementing rather than replacing the Model's commentaries.

The Manual serves as a training tool for developing country officials entering treaty negotiations. It emphasizes the importance of developing coherent treaty policy before entering negotiations, rather than approaching each negotiation ad hoc. This guidance helps countries avoid treaty provisions that may unduly constrain their taxing rights.

#### 3.3. UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing

The United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries addresses the application of transfer pricing rules in developing country contexts. Updated versions have been issued as transfer pricing practice evolves, with significant revisions addressing practical implementation challenges.

The Manual recognizes that developing countries face particular difficulties implementing transfer pricing rules. Limited availability of comparables data, capacity constraints in tax administrations, and the complexity of multinational structures all create challenges. The Manual provides practical approaches suited to these circumstances, rather than simply reproducing guidance developed for advanced economy contexts.

Key topics include transfer pricing methods, comparability analysis with limited data, documentation requirements appropriate to developing country contexts, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The Manual complements the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines while addressing issues of particular relevance to developing countries.

### 4. Thematic Work Areas

#### 4.1. Digital Economy Taxation

The taxation of digitalized business models has become a central focus of Committee work. Developing countries have expressed particular concern that traditional tax rules, designed for physical economy transactions, fail to capture value created through digital activities in their jurisdictions.

The Committee's work on Article 12B of the UN Model Convention provides developing countries with a treaty-based mechanism to tax automated digital services at source. This approach differs from the OECD's Amount A proposal under Pillar One, offering a simpler alternative that developing countries can implement bilaterally rather than requiring multilateral agreement.

The Committee continues to address emerging digital economy issues, including platform economy taxation, crypto-asset taxation, and the interaction between digital and traditional tax rules.

#### 4.2. Environmental Taxation

Environmental taxation has gained prominence as countries seek to address climate change while mobilizing domestic revenue. The Committee's work in this area helps developing countries design and implement environmental fiscal measures, including carbon pricing, fuel taxes, and other instruments.

The Committee recognizes that environmental taxation involves trade-offs. Revenue objectives, environmental effectiveness, distributional impacts, and international competitiveness all require consideration. Guidance addresses how developing countries can balance these factors given their circumstances.

#### 4.3. Capacity Building

Capacity building runs through all Committee work. Beyond producing guidance documents, the Committee supports direct capacity-building activities including training workshops, technical consultations, and participation in the Platform for Collaboration on Tax.

The Committee's capacity-building focus reflects recognition that guidance documents alone do not ensure effective implementation. Developing country tax administrations require trained personnel, appropriate systems, and institutional frameworks to apply international tax rules effectively.

### 5. Relationship with Other Bodies

#### 5.1. Comparison with OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs

The Committee operates alongside the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs, which develops the OECD Model Tax Convention and other OECD tax instruments. The relationship is complementary but reflects different institutional perspectives.

The OECD Committee represents primarily developed country interests, though the OECD's Inclusive Framework has broadened participation in BEPS-related work. The UN Committee, with majority developing country membership, provides a forum where developing country perspectives shape outcomes rather than merely participating in developed country processes.

The two Model Conventions differ in ways reflecting these perspectives. The UN Model generally preserves greater source country taxation rights, addressing developing country concerns as typical capital importers. The OECD Model, reflecting residence country perspectives, provides comparatively greater relief from source taxation.

Recent discussions about a UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation reflect ongoing debate about the appropriate institutional framework for international tax governance. Some developing countries have expressed preference for UN-centred processes offering formal equality among all countries, rather than OECD-centred processes where developing countries participate by invitation. The 2023 UN General Assembly resolution calling for development of terms of reference for a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation represents a significant development in this direction, potentially reshaping the landscape of international tax governance.

The relationship between the UN and OECD in international tax matters continues to evolve. While the OECD remains the primary technical body for many international tax issues, the UN's role is expanding as developing countries seek greater voice in shaping rules that significantly affect their revenues.

#### 5.2. Platform for Collaboration on Tax

The Committee participates in the Platform for Collaboration on Tax alongside the IMF, OECD, and World Bank. This collaboration enables the Committee to contribute UN perspectives to joint products while leveraging the expertise and resources of partner organizations.

UN participation in the Platform helps ensure that joint outputs address developing country needs. The Manual for Negotiation of Bilateral Tax Treaties, for example, informed the Platform's Toolkit on Tax Treaty Negotiations, which builds on UN guidance while providing additional capacity-building support.

The Platform relationship also supports coordination of technical assistance activities, helping avoid duplication while ensuring developing countries receive comprehensive support across the range of international tax issues they face.
