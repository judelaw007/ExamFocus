## Chapter 20: The Work of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax

### 1. Introduction and Establishment

#### 1.1. Origins and Mission

The Platform for Collaboration on Tax (PCT) was launched in April 2016 as a joint initiative bringing together the four largest multilateral organizations active in international tax matters. The Platform emerged from recognition that developing countries face particular challenges in building effective tax systems and require coordinated support from international organizations rather than fragmented assistance from multiple sources with potentially inconsistent advice.

The PCT's mission centres on supporting countries' efforts to improve revenue mobilization by leveraging the complementary expertise and experience of its partner organizations. Each partner brings distinct capabilities—policy analysis, standard-setting, technical assistance, capacity building, and development financing—that together provide comprehensive support unavailable from any single organization.

The Platform's establishment reflected broader international developments in tax cooperation. The G20/OECD BEPS project highlighted that developing countries, while affected by base erosion and profit shifting, often lacked the technical capacity to implement BEPS recommendations effectively. The PCT responded to calls from the G20 Development Working Group for enhanced support to help developing countries address international tax challenges.

#### 1.2. The Four Partner Organizations

The PCT comprises four partner organizations, each contributing distinct expertise:

The **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** brings macroeconomic perspective and extensive technical assistance experience. The IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department has provided tax policy and administration support to developing countries for decades, with particular expertise in revenue forecasting, tax system design, and the relationship between taxation and fiscal sustainability.

The **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)** contributes its role as the primary standard-setter for international taxation. The OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs develops the Model Tax Convention and Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and the OECD Secretariat led the technical work on the BEPS project. This standard-setting expertise complements capacity-building activities.

The **United Nations** brings legitimacy and inclusive representation, particularly important for developing countries. The UN Tax Committee develops the UN Model Double Taxation Convention, which contains provisions specifically addressing developing country concerns. The UN's involvement ensures that PCT work reflects diverse country perspectives, not only those of OECD members.

The **World Bank Group** contributes development finance expertise and extensive country presence. The World Bank's engagement with developing countries through lending operations and policy dialogue provides channels for implementing PCT recommendations. The World Bank Group currently hosts the PCT Secretariat.

#### 1.3. Governance and Support

The PCT operates through a Secretariat, currently hosted by the World Bank Group, which coordinates activities among the partner organizations. The Secretariat maintains the Tax Projects Database, providing transparency about technical assistance and capacity-building activities across partners and enabling coordination to avoid duplication.

Several governments provide financial support to the PCT, including Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. This support enables the development of toolkits, organization of workshops, and other activities that would otherwise strain partner organization resources.

The governance structure reflects the collaborative nature of the Platform. Decisions require consensus among partners, ensuring that PCT outputs reflect agreed positions rather than any single organization's perspective. This consensus requirement can slow production but enhances the authority of resulting guidance.

### 2. Strategic Objectives

#### 2.1. Capacity Building for Developing Countries

The PCT's primary objective is building tax capacity in developing countries. This objective encompasses multiple dimensions: strengthening tax policy frameworks, improving tax administration, enhancing the skills of tax officials, and enabling meaningful participation in international tax discussions.

Capacity building occurs through several channels. Technical assistance provides direct support to countries designing or implementing tax reforms. Knowledge products—toolkits, guidance notes, and reports—make expertise accessible to countries that may not receive direct assistance. Training programs and workshops develop skills among tax officials.

The PCT approach emphasizes country ownership. Rather than imposing external solutions, the Platform supports countries in developing their own approaches suited to their circumstances. The Medium-Term Revenue Strategy (MTRS) framework, discussed below, exemplifies this country-owned approach.

#### 2.2. Connection to Sustainable Development Goals

The PCT's work connects directly to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 17.1 specifically calls for strengthening domestic resource mobilization to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection. Effective taxation provides the sustainable financing necessary to achieve other development goals—education, health, infrastructure, and environmental protection.

This SDG connection elevates tax capacity building from a technical matter to a development priority. The Platform's work helps countries build the revenue base necessary for sustainable development without dependence on external aid or unsustainable borrowing. Domestic resource mobilization provides more predictable, reliable financing than external sources.

The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced these connections. Countries with stronger tax systems proved more resilient, able to finance crisis responses and recovery without accumulating unsustainable debt. The PCT's work on building tax capacity thus contributes to development resilience.

#### 2.3. Relationship with BEPS and G20

The PCT maintains close connections with the BEPS project and G20 processes. The G20 Development Working Group specifically requested that the PCT develop toolkits to help developing countries implement BEPS recommendations. This mandate ensures that PCT work addresses practical implementation challenges, not merely theoretical policy options.

Over 140 countries now participate in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, implementing minimum standards and reviewing implementation. Many developing country participants lack the technical capacity to implement BEPS measures effectively. The PCT helps bridge this implementation gap through practical guidance tailored to developing country circumstances.

The relationship is complementary rather than duplicative. The Inclusive Framework sets standards; the PCT helps countries implement them. The Inclusive Framework addresses what countries should do; the PCT addresses how they can do it given resource and capacity constraints.

### 3. Key Toolkits and Publications

#### 3.1. Transfer Pricing Toolkits

Transfer pricing presents particular challenges for developing countries. Multinational enterprises operating in developing countries engage in intercompany transactions that may shift profits away from source jurisdictions. Addressing this requires transfer pricing rules and the administrative capacity to enforce them—both often lacking in developing countries.

The PCT has produced multiple transfer pricing resources. The **Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses**, released in 2017, addresses a fundamental challenge: transfer pricing analysis requires comparable transaction data that may not exist in developing country contexts. The toolkit provides practical approaches for tax administrations facing data limitations.

A subsequent toolkit on **Transfer Pricing Documentation** addresses how developing countries can implement effective documentation requirements. Requiring multinationals to document their transfer pricing positions provides tax administrations with information necessary for risk assessment and audit, but documentation requirements must balance compliance burdens against information needs.

These toolkits respond to G20 requests and reflect practical experience from PCT partner organizations' technical assistance work. They provide developing countries with approaches tested in similar contexts, avoiding the need to develop solutions from scratch.

#### 3.2. Offshore Indirect Transfers Toolkit

Released in June 2020, the **Toolkit on the Taxation of Offshore Indirect Transfers** addresses a concern of particular significance to resource-rich developing countries. When ownership of entities holding valuable assets—mineral rights, telecommunications licenses, infrastructure—changes hands offshore, capital gains may escape taxation in the country where assets are located.

The toolkit arose from high-profile cases where developing countries sought to tax offshore transactions but faced legal and practical challenges. The Uganda-Zain case, involving capital gains on the sale of telecommunications assets, illustrated both the stakes involved and the complexity of the issues.

The toolkit provides two models for domestic legislation enabling taxation of offshore indirect transfers. The deemed disposal model treats the resident entity as having realized gains on underlying assets. The direct taxation model taxes the non-resident seller directly. Countries may choose based on their circumstances and legal traditions.

Beyond legislative models, the toolkit addresses practical implementation—valuation challenges, information access, collection mechanisms, and treaty interactions. This comprehensive treatment reflects the PCT's practical orientation.

#### 3.3. Tax Treaty Negotiations Toolkit

Released in March 2021, the **Toolkit on Tax Treaty Negotiations** addresses a fundamental concern for developing countries: ensuring that bilateral tax treaties appropriately balance source and residence country interests. Developing countries, often source countries for investment, may have historically entered treaties that unduly constrained their taxing rights.

The toolkit guides countries through the treaty negotiation process: deciding whether a treaty is needed, developing a treaty policy framework, preparing for negotiations, conducting negotiations, and implementing agreements. It draws on existing guidance, particularly the UN Manual for the Negotiation of Bilateral Tax Treaties, while providing practical supplements.

The toolkit's release coincided with renewed attention to treaty policy in light of BEPS developments. The minimum standard to combat treaty shopping, the principal purpose test, and the MLI implementation raised questions about existing treaty networks. Many countries are reviewing treaty policies, making the toolkit particularly timely.

#### 3.4. Tax Incentives Guidance

The earliest PCT publication, released in 2015, addressed **Tax Incentives for Investment**. Developing countries frequently use tax incentives to attract foreign investment, but poorly designed incentives may sacrifice revenue without achieving intended benefits.

This guidance helps countries evaluate whether incentives are necessary, design incentives to minimize revenue costs, and assess incentive effectiveness. It addresses the "race to the bottom" dynamic where countries compete through ever-more-generous incentives, ultimately benefiting investors at the expense of all competing jurisdictions.

In December 2024, the PCT released updated **Tax Incentives Principles** for public consultation, reflecting evolving understanding and new challenges, including the implications of Pillar Two minimum taxation for incentive design.

### 4. Medium-Term Revenue Strategies

#### 4.1. The MTRS Framework

The Medium-Term Revenue Strategy (MTRS) represents the PCT's approach to comprehensive, country-owned tax reform. An MTRS is a high-level roadmap, typically covering five to ten years, setting out how a country will strengthen its tax system to achieve revenue and broader policy objectives.

The MTRS approach emerged from recognition that sustainable tax reform requires coherent strategy rather than ad hoc interventions. Successful reform requires political commitment, stakeholder engagement, and sequenced implementation—elements that isolated technical assistance cannot provide.

An MTRS addresses tax policy, tax administration, and the legal framework together. It establishes revenue targets linked to expenditure needs, identifies reforms necessary to achieve targets, and sequences implementation realistically. Political leadership endorses the strategy, providing mandate for sometimes-difficult reforms.

#### 4.2. Implementation Support

The PCT partners support MTRS development and implementation through coordinated assistance. Countries developing MTRS receive analytical support for diagnostic assessment, technical advice on reform options, and assistance with stakeholder consultation and strategy development.

Implementation support continues beyond strategy adoption. Partner organizations provide technical assistance for specific reforms, capacity building for tax administration, and policy dialogue to maintain political commitment. The coordinated approach ensures consistent advice and avoids the fragmentation that sometimes characterizes international support.

Countries including Georgia, Indonesia, and Uganda have developed MTRS with PCT support, demonstrating the approach's applicability across diverse contexts. Experience from early adopters informs refinement of the framework and guidance.

### 5. Ongoing Activities and Future Directions

#### 5.1. Environmental Taxation

The PCT has expanded its work to address environmental taxation, reflecting both climate urgency and the revenue potential of environmental taxes. Carbon pricing and environmental taxes can generate substantial revenue while addressing climate externalities—a double dividend particularly valuable for developing countries.

Environmental taxation work connects to the SDG agenda, specifically climate-related goals, while supporting revenue mobilization objectives. The PCT provides guidance on environmental tax design, helping countries navigate the technical and political challenges of implementing carbon pricing or related measures.

#### 5.2. Stakeholder Engagement

The PCT emphasizes stakeholder engagement beyond government officials. Civil society organizations, business associations, and academic institutions contribute perspectives that improve guidance and build support for reform. Public consultations on draft toolkits incorporate diverse views.

The PCT maintains an active outreach program, including webinars launching new publications, workshops providing in-depth training, and participation in international tax conferences. These activities disseminate PCT work and gather feedback informing future priorities.

The Platform's work continues to evolve as international tax developments create new challenges and opportunities for developing countries. The two-pillar solution addressing digitalization and minimum taxation will require implementation support that the PCT is positioned to provide. The Platform's collaborative model—bringing together standard-setters, technical assistance providers, and development financiers—remains well-suited to the comprehensive support developing countries require.
