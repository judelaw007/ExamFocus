# Chapter 3.2: The UN Model Double Taxation Convention 2021

## 1. The Developing Country Perspective

### 1.1. Capital-Importing Nations and Source Taxation

The OECD Model Tax Convention was developed primarily by capital-exporting developed countries and reflects their interests in residence-based taxation. This approach tends to benefit countries where multinational headquarters are located, allowing them to tax the worldwide income of their residents while limiting source-country taxation through lower withholding rates and narrower permanent establishment definitions.

Developing countries, however, are typically capital-importing nations—they receive foreign investment rather than export it. For these countries, source-based taxation is critical because it enables them to tax income generated within their borders by foreign enterprises. Without adequate source taxation rights, developing countries see economic value extracted from their territories without corresponding tax revenue to fund public services and development.

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention exists to provide developing countries with a treaty template that better protects their fiscal interests by granting greater source-country taxing rights. While the OECD Model remains influential globally, the UN Model offers an alternative framework that recognises the asymmetric economic relationships between developed and developing countries. This recognition has shaped treaties between developed and developing nations, where many provisions reflect UN Model principles even when the overall treaty structure follows OECD lines.

### 1.2. Historical Development

The United Nations' involvement in international tax matters has deep historical roots. The League of Nations published the first model bilateral tax treaty in 1928, establishing the conceptual framework that continues to underpin modern tax treaty practice. Following World War II, the newly established United Nations continued this work.

In 1967, the UN established the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on Tax Treaties between Developed and Developing Countries, specifically tasked with addressing the particular circumstances of developing nations in treaty negotiations. This Group published the first UN Model Double Taxation Convention in 1980, providing developing countries with an authoritative reference point distinct from the OECD Model.

The UN Model has undergone several significant revisions. The 2001 restructuring established the UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters as a subsidiary body of ECOSOC. Major revisions followed in 2011 and 2017, with the 2017 update incorporating relevant BEPS developments. The 2021 version introduced Articles 12A (Fees for Technical Services) and 12B (Income from Automated Digital Services), representing the most significant expansion of source-country taxing rights in the Model's history. Most recently, the 2025 update introduced changes to Article 8, offering a choice between residence-based and source-based taxation for international air transport operators.

## 2. The UN Committee of Experts

### 2.1. Role and Composition

The UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters is the subsidiary body of ECOSOC responsible for developing and updating the UN Model and its Commentary. The Committee comprises 25 members nominated by governments but serving in their personal capacity rather than as government representatives. This structure ensures that members bring expertise while maintaining independence from direct governmental instruction.

The Committee's composition deliberately balances developed and developing country perspectives, with attention to geographical representation and gender balance. Members typically include senior tax officials, academics, and practitioners with extensive experience in international taxation.

The Committee's mandate extends beyond maintaining the UN Model. It provides guidance on international tax issues, promotes cooperation between developed and developing countries, and develops practical tools such as the UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries. The Committee meets in regular sessions—typically twice yearly in New York and Geneva—to advance its work programme.

### 2.2. The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation

A significant development in international tax governance is the UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation. In December 2023, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 78/230, establishing an ad hoc committee to draft terms of reference for a framework convention. This resolution, championed by African nations with Nigeria playing a leading role, represented a decisive shift toward UN-led standard-setting in international taxation.

In December 2024, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 79/235, establishing an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) to draft the framework convention and two early protocols. Negotiations commenced in February 2025 at UN Headquarters, with the INC scheduled to meet three times annually through 2027, when the completed convention is expected to be submitted to the General Assembly.

The Terms of Reference specify that one early protocol will address taxation of income from cross-border services in the increasingly digitalised economy—directly relevant to the UN Model's Articles 12A and 12B. This development represents a potential transformation in international tax governance, offering developing countries a more inclusive forum than the OECD-led processes that have historically dominated standard-setting.

## 3. Source Versus Residence: The Fundamental Philosophy

### 3.1. The Core Distinction

The fundamental philosophical difference between the UN and OECD Models concerns the allocation of taxing rights between source and residence states. The OECD Model generally favours residence-based taxation, limiting source-country rights through narrow permanent establishment definitions, lower withholding tax rates, and exclusive residence-country taxation for certain income categories such as royalties.

The UN Model takes a different approach, consistently favouring source-country taxing rights. This manifests in broader permanent establishment definitions that more readily create taxable presence, higher or negotiable withholding tax rates, source taxation of royalties (which the OECD Model allocates exclusively to the residence country), and specific provisions for technical services and digital services that enable source taxation without requiring permanent establishment.

This philosophical difference reflects the economic realities of developed-developing country relationships. When a multinational enterprise based in a developed country operates in a developing country, the OECD Model's residence emphasis means more revenue flows to the developed country's treasury. The UN Model's source emphasis redirects some of that revenue to the developing country where the economic activity actually occurs.

### 3.2. Practical Implications

The practical consequences of this philosophical difference are substantial. Consider a scenario where a developed-country enterprise provides technical consulting services to clients in a developing country without establishing a permanent establishment there. Under the OECD Model, the service fees would generally be taxable only in the residence country. Under the UN Model's Article 12A, the source country can impose withholding tax on those fees regardless of physical presence.

Similarly, for digital services provided remotely to developing country users, the OECD Model provides no specific mechanism for source taxation absent permanent establishment. The UN Model's Article 12B explicitly grants source-country taxing rights over automated digital services income, recognising that significant value is created where users and customers are located even without traditional physical presence.

These differences explain why past examinations have frequently tested the comparison between UN and OECD approaches. Understanding when and how source-country taxing rights arise under each Model is essential for analysing treaty-based tax outcomes.

## 4. Structural Differences from the OECD MTC

### 4.1. Permanent Establishment (Article 5)

The UN Model's broader permanent establishment definition is one of its most significant features for protecting source-country taxing rights. Several provisions in UN Model Article 5 have no equivalent in the OECD Model.

For construction site permanent establishment, the UN Model uses a six-month threshold compared to the OECD Model's twelve months. This shorter period means that construction projects more readily create taxable presence in the source country.

The services permanent establishment provision in Article 5(3)(b) is perhaps the most notable UN-specific feature. Under this provision, an enterprise has a permanent establishment if it furnishes services through employees or other personnel present in the source country for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period for the same or a connected project. This creates taxable presence based on service activity duration rather than requiring a fixed place of business—a crucial provision for developing countries that import professional and technical services.

The UN Model also includes specific provisions for insurance activities creating permanent establishment (Article 5(6)), which has no OECD equivalent. These broader PE definitions collectively ensure that more business activities conducted in developing countries create taxable nexus, enabling source-country taxation that would not arise under OECD Model provisions.

### 4.2. Independent Personal Services (Article 14)

The UN Model retains Article 14 on Independent Personal Services, which the OECD Model deleted in 2000. Under the OECD approach, income from independent personal services falls within Article 7 on Business Profits and is taxable in the source country only if attributable to a permanent establishment there.

The UN Model's Article 14 provides an alternative basis for source-country taxation. Independent personal services income may be taxed in the source country if the individual has a "fixed base" regularly available there, or if the individual is present in the source country for 183 days or more in a twelve-month period. This second condition provides source-country taxing rights based purely on presence duration, without requiring any fixed base—an approach more favourable to developing countries seeking to tax professional services income.

The retention of Article 14 reflects the UN's recognition that developing countries frequently import professional services from developed-country individuals, and that source taxation of such income is legitimate given the economic connection to the source territory.

### 4.3. The Force of Attraction Rule

The UN Model includes a limited force of attraction rule that extends source-country taxing rights once a permanent establishment threshold is met. Under this rule, once an enterprise has a permanent establishment in a contracting state, profits from activities carried on in that state that are identical or similar to those conducted through the permanent establishment may be taxed there, even if those particular profits are not actually attributable to the permanent establishment.

This rule prevents enterprises from artificially channelling activities outside their permanent establishment to avoid source-country taxation. While the OECD Model does not include a force of attraction provision, the UN Model's inclusion reflects developing country concerns about base erosion through profit allocation structures that minimise PE-attributable income.

## 5. Unique UN Model Provisions

### 5.1. Article 12A: Fees for Technical Services

Article 12A, introduced in the 2017 UN Model and refined in 2021, permits source-country taxation of fees for technical services. This provision addresses a significant gap that developing countries identified in the traditional treaty framework.

Article 12A(3) defines fees for technical services as payments for managerial services, technical services, and consultancy services. The source state may tax these fees regardless of whether the payer has a permanent establishment in the source state, and regardless of where the services are performed. This represents a significant departure from the OECD approach, where such fees would generally be taxable only in the residence country absent a permanent establishment.

The rationale for Article 12A is straightforward: developing countries frequently import technical, managerial, and consultancy services from developed countries. Without this provision, payments for such services would flow outward with no source-country taxation, despite the clear economic connection to the source territory where the services are utilised. Article 12A corrects this imbalance by enabling withholding tax on gross payments at bilaterally negotiated rates.

The Article excludes payments to employees (covered by Article 15), payments for teaching in educational institutions, and payments by individuals for personal services. It also establishes priority rules: if services involve transfer of information that would constitute royalties under Article 12, then Article 12 applies instead.

The UN Committee has considered proposals to combine Articles 12A and 14 into a single comprehensive provision on cross-border services taxation. This potential consolidation reflects the overlapping scope of these provisions and the practical challenges of distinguishing between different service categories.

### 5.2. Article 12B: Income from Automated Digital Services

Article 12B, introduced in the 2021 UN Model, addresses the taxation of income from automated digital services—the UN's response to the tax challenges of the digitalised economy. This provision offers a simpler alternative to the complex OECD Pillar One approach.

Article 12B(5) defines income from automated digital services as payment for any service provided on the internet or electronic network requiring minimal human involvement from the service provider. Covered services include online advertising services, supply of user data, online search engines, online intermediation platform services, social media platforms, digital content services, online gaming, cloud computing services, and standardised online teaching services.

The Article provides two routes for source-country taxation. The first is a gross-based withholding tax at a bilaterally negotiated rate—typically suggested at 3-4%. The second is a net income approach using an apportionment formula that allocates 30% of the enterprise's net income from automated digital services to countries where revenues arise. Taxpayers may choose between these approaches, providing flexibility while ensuring source-country taxation.

Article 12B applies without requiring permanent establishment or any minimum period of presence in the source country. This feature directly addresses the challenge that digital business models can generate significant revenue from a jurisdiction without any physical presence there. For developing countries with limited administrative capacity, the gross-based withholding approach offers simplicity and enforceability.

Importantly, Article 12B has no revenue or profitability thresholds—unlike OECD Pillar One's Amount A, which applies only to enterprises exceeding €20 billion in global revenue. This breadth means Article 12B applies to all enterprises providing automated digital services, not just the largest multinationals, potentially offering developing countries broader tax base protection.

### 5.3. Relationship and Priority Rules

The relationship between Articles 12 (Royalties), 12A (Technical Services), and 12B (Automated Digital Services) requires careful attention. Each addresses distinct income categories, with priority rules determining which applies when boundaries blur.

Royalties involving use of intellectual property rights fall under Article 12. If payment is for technical services requiring human involvement, Article 12A applies. If payment is for automated digital services with minimal human involvement, Article 12B applies. Business profits not falling within these specific categories are governed by Article 7.

The key distinction between Articles 12A and 12B lies in human involvement. Technical, managerial, and consultancy services typically require significant human engagement and fall under Article 12A. Automated services delivered with minimal human involvement—where the technology rather than people delivers the service—fall under Article 12B. This distinction matters because it determines which withholding regime applies and at what rate.

## 6. Withholding Tax Differences

### 6.1. Dividends, Interest, and Royalties

The UN and OECD Models differ significantly in their approach to passive income taxation.

For dividends (Article 10), the OECD Model specifies rates of 5% for substantial shareholdings and 15% for portfolio holdings. The UN Model deliberately leaves rates blank, allowing greater flexibility in bilateral negotiations. In practice, developing countries often negotiate rates of 5-15% for intercompany dividends and 15-25% for portfolio dividends—generally higher than OECD Model rates.

For interest (Article 11), both Models permit source-country taxation, but the UN Model typically supports higher negotiated rates than the OECD Model's suggested 10% limit.

The most fundamental difference concerns royalties (Article 12). Under the OECD Model, royalties are taxed exclusively in the residence country—the source country has no taxing rights. Under the UN Model, the source country may impose withholding tax on royalties at negotiated rates. This difference is perhaps the starkest illustration of the Models' different philosophies: the OECD Model effectively transfers royalty-related tax revenue to developed countries where intellectual property owners typically reside, while the UN Model allows developing countries to retain a share of tax on royalties for intellectual property used within their borders.

### 6.2. Negotiable Rates Philosophy

The UN Model's deliberate omission of specified withholding rates reflects its philosophy of preserving developing country negotiating flexibility. Unlike the OECD Model's specified rates, which developed countries often treat as maximum acceptable levels, the UN Model's blank rates encourage genuine bilateral negotiation appropriate to each treaty relationship.

This approach recognises that appropriate withholding rates depend on the specific circumstances of the contracting states—their relative development levels, investment flows, administrative capacity, and domestic tax policies. What suits a treaty between two OECD members may not suit a treaty between a developed country and a least-developed country.

## 7. The UN Model in Practice

### 7.1. Countries Using the UN Model

Developing countries across regions typically prefer the UN Model as their primary reference for treaty negotiations. In Africa, countries including Kenya, Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria, and South Africa draw heavily on UN Model provisions. In Asia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam similarly favour source-country-oriented provisions. Latin American countries including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina also reflect UN Model influence in their treaty networks.

India provides a notable example of consistent UN Model adoption. Being primarily a source country for inward investment, India has systematically negotiated higher source-country taxing rights in its treaties, particularly for technical services, equipment royalties, and interest. India's domestic law provisions on taxing such income have been aggressive, with treaty provisions often reflecting UN Model principles even when the overall treaty structure follows OECD lines.

In practice, many treaties represent hybrids combining elements from both Models. A treaty may follow OECD structure while incorporating UN-style source taxation provisions for specific income categories. Bilateral negotiations ultimately determine the balance, with the relative bargaining power of contracting states influencing outcomes. Past examinations have tested these comparative issues, requiring analysis of how specific treaty provisions allocate taxing rights.

### 7.2. Challenges for Developing Countries

Despite the UN Model's favourable provisions, developing countries face significant challenges in treaty negotiations. Negotiating capacity remains a persistent constraint. Developed countries typically have larger, more experienced treaty negotiation teams backed by extensive technical resources. Developing countries often have limited specialised staff in tax treaty units, constrained resources for technical analysis, and less institutional experience with complex treaty provisions.

Information asymmetry compounds these challenges. Developed countries generally have better data on investment flows, enabling more informed assessment of treaty revenue implications. Developing countries may struggle to assess the true cost-benefit of specific provisions, potentially agreeing to terms that favour the treaty partner.

Competitive pressures also influence negotiations. Developing countries may face implicit pressure to offer favourable terms to attract foreign investment, leading to a "race to the bottom" in source-country taxing rights. The desire to maintain competitiveness with neighbouring countries can undermine collective developing country interests.

Administrative capacity presents practical constraints even after treaties are concluded. Effective withholding tax systems require efficient administration, and exchange of information obligations demand resources that some developing countries struggle to provide. The IMF has recommended that developing countries conduct thorough cost-benefit analysis before entering DTAs, critically assessing whether agreements truly serve their interests.

The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation represents an effort to address some of these structural imbalances by providing developing countries with a more inclusive forum for shaping international tax standards. Whether this initiative succeeds in rebalancing the international tax architecture remains to be seen, but its emergence reflects developing country dissatisfaction with existing processes.
