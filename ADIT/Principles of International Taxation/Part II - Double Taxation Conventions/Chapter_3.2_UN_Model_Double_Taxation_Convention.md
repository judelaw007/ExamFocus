## A. INTRODUCTION: WHY A SEPARATE UN MODEL?

### 1. The Developing Country Perspective

The OECD Model Tax Convention was developed primarily by capital-exporting developed countries and reflects their interests in **residence-based taxation**. This approach tends to benefit countries where multinational headquarters are located, allowing them to tax worldwide income of their residents.

Developing countries, however, are typically **capital-importing** nations—they receive foreign investment rather than export it. For these countries, **source-based taxation** is critical because it enables them to tax income generated within their borders by foreign enterprises.

> **The UN MDTC exists to provide developing countries with a model treaty that better protects their fiscal interests by granting greater source-country taxing rights.**

### 2. Historical Development

The UN's involvement in international tax matters has a long history:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **1928** | League of Nations publishes first model bilateral tax treaty |
| **1967** | UN establishes Ad Hoc Group of Experts on Tax Treaties between Developed and Developing Countries |
| **1980** | First UN Model Double Taxation Convention published |
| **2001** | UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters established |
| **2011** | Major revision of UN Model |
| **2017** | Updated UN Model incorporating BEPS developments |
| **2021** | Current UN Model published with Articles 12A and 12B |

### 3. The UN Committee of Experts

The **UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters** is a subsidiary body of ECOSOC (Economic and Social Council) responsible for:

- Updating and maintaining the UN Model and its Commentary
- Providing guidance on international tax issues
- Promoting cooperation between developed and developing countries
- Developing the UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing

The Committee consists of 25 members serving in their personal capacity (not as government representatives), ensuring a balance between developed and developing country perspectives.

## B. FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHY: SOURCE VS RESIDENCE

### 1. The Core Distinction

```
SOURCE-BASED vs RESIDENCE-BASED TAXATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

UN MODEL (SOURCE EMPHASIS)           OECD MODEL (RESIDENCE EMPHASIS)
         │                                      │

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Why This Matters for Developing Countries

The philosophical difference has real economic consequences:

| Scenario | UN Model Effect | OECD Model Effect |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Foreign MNE operates in developing country | Source country retains more taxing rights | Residence country (MNE's home state) retains more rights |
| Dividends paid to foreign parent | Higher withholding tax permitted | Lower/zero withholding tax encouraged |
| Technical services provided by non-resident | Source country can tax (Article 12A) | Generally not taxable in source country |
| Digital services revenue | Source country can tax (Article 12B) | No specific provision; falls to business profits rules |

---

## C. KEY STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES: UN MDTC vs OECD MTC

### 1. Overview Comparison

| Feature | UN MDTC | OECD MTC |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Primary orientation** | Source-country taxing rights | Residence-country taxing rights |
| **Target users** | Developed-developing country treaties | Developed-developed country treaties |
| **PE definition** | Broader (easier to establish PE) | Narrower (harder to establish PE) |
| **Service PE** | Yes (Article 5(3)(b)) | No equivalent |
| **Independent Personal Services** | Article 14 retained | Article 14 deleted (2000) |
| **Technical Services** | Article 12A (source taxation) | No equivalent |
| **Digital Services** | Article 12B (source taxation) | No equivalent |
| **Withholding tax rates** | Higher permitted rates | Lower rates encouraged |

### 2. Permanent Establishment (Article 5)

The UN Model's broader PE definition is one of its most significant features for protecting source-country taxing rights.

**UN Model Includes:**

```
UN MODEL PE PROVISIONS NOT IN OECD MODEL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Article 5(3)(a) - Building Site PE:
  • UN: 6-month threshold for construction PE
  • OECD: 12-month threshold

Article 5(3)(b) - Services PE:
  • UN: Services performed by enterprise through employees/personnel
    present in source country for >183 days in any 12-month period
    = PE is created
  • OECD: No equivalent - services must meet standard PE tests

Article 5(6) - Insurance PE:
  • UN: Includes insurance activities as creating PE
  • OECD: No equivalent

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Exam Application**: When analyzing whether a PE exists, always check which Model the DTA is based on. A service activity that does not create a PE under the OECD Model may create one under the UN Model.

### 3. Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

The UN Model **retains Article 14**, which was deleted from the OECD Model in 2000:

| Model | Treatment of Independent Personal Services |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| **UN MDTC** | Article 14 allows source taxation if individual has "fixed base" or is present for >183 days |
| **OECD MTC** | No Article 14; independent personal services fall under Article 7 (Business Profits) |

This distinction matters because it provides developing countries with additional taxing rights over professional services income earned by non-residents.

---

## D. UNIQUE UN MODEL PROVISIONS

### 1. Article 12A - Fees for Technical Services

Article 12A is a distinctive UN provision that permits source-country taxation of fees for technical services.

```
ARTICLE 12A - FEES FOR TECHNICAL SERVICES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Definition (Article 12A(3)):
"Fees for technical services" means payments for:
  • Managerial services
  • Technical services
  • Consultancy services

Key Features:
  • Source state may tax REGARDLESS of whether payer has PE in source state
  • Withholding tax typically applies on gross payment
  • Rate to be negotiated bilaterally (no specified rate in Model)

Exclusions:
  • Payments to employees (covered by Article 15)
  • Payments for teaching in educational institutions
  • Payments by individuals for personal services

Link to Article 12:
  • If services involve transfer of information that would be royalties
    under Article 12, then Article 12 applies instead

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Rationale**: Developing countries frequently import technical, managerial, and consultancy services from developed countries. Without Article 12A, these payments would generally only be taxable in the residence country (where the service provider is based), leaving the source country without any taxing rights over income economically connected to activities within its territory.

### 2. Article 12B - Income from Automated Digital Services

Article 12B was introduced in the 2021 UN Model to address the digital economy's tax challenges—providing an alternative to the complex OECD Pillar One approach.

```
ARTICLE 12B - INCOME FROM AUTOMATED DIGITAL SERVICES (ADS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Definition (Article 12B(5)):
"Income from automated digital services" means payment for any service
provided on the internet or electronic network requiring MINIMAL HUMAN
INVOLVEMENT from the service provider.

Covered Services Include:
  • Online advertising services
  • Supply of user data
  • Online search engines
  • Online intermediation platform services
  • Social media platforms
  • Digital content services
  • Online gaming
  • Cloud computing services
  • Standardized online teaching services

Key Features:
  • Source state can tax - withholding tax on gross payments
  • NO PE required in source state
  • Applies to payments arising in source state
  • Rate negotiated bilaterally (3-4% commonly suggested)

Exclusions:
  • Customized professional services (covered by Article 12A)
  • Services requiring substantial human involvement
  • Online sale of goods (physical or digital) if not ADS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Why Article 12B Matters for Developing Countries**:

1. **Simplicity**: Unlike OECD Pillar One (Amount A), Article 12B uses a simple withholding tax mechanism
2. **No revenue threshold**: Applies to all enterprises, not just those above €20 billion
3. **Administrative ease**: Withholding on gross payments is easier to enforce than profit allocation
4. **Immediate source taxation**: No requirement to establish PE or physical presence

### 3. Relationship Between Articles 12, 12A, and 12B

```
ARTICLE HIERARCHY FOR SERVICE/DIGITAL PAYMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Payment Type                          → Applicable Article
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Royalties (copyright, patents, etc.)  → Article 12
Technical/consultancy services        → Article 12A
Automated digital services            → Article 12B
Business profits (if PE exists)       → Article 7
Business profits (no PE)              → Article 7 (residence only)

Priority Rules:
1. If payment is for use of IP rights → Article 12 takes precedence
2. If payment is for technical services requiring human involvement
   → Article 12A
3. If payment is for automated digital services with minimal
   human involvement → Article 12B
4. Residual: Article 7 (Business Profits)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## E. WITHHOLDING TAX DIFFERENCES

### 1. Dividends (Article 10)

| Feature | UN MDTC | OECD MTC |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Rates specified** | No specific rates | 5% (substantial shareholding) / 15% (others) |
| **Typical DTA practice** | 5-15% intercompany / 15-25% portfolio | 5% / 15% as specified |
| **Approach** | Source country preserves broader taxing right | Lower rates protect residence country |

The UN Model deliberately leaves rates blank to allow greater flexibility in bilateral negotiations—enabling developing countries to negotiate rates appropriate to their circumstances.

### 2. Interest (Article 11)

| Feature | UN MDTC | OECD MTC |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Source taxation** | Permitted; rates negotiable | Permitted; 10% limit suggested |
| **Government debt** | Specific provisions for exemption | Similar |
| **Practice** | Developing countries often negotiate higher rates | Lower rates more common |

### 3. Royalties (Article 12)

| Feature | UN MDTC | OECD MTC |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Source taxation** | Yes - rate negotiable | No source taxation (residence exclusive) |
| **Impact** | Source country retains taxing right | Residence country has sole taxing right |

This is a **fundamental difference**: Under the OECD Model, royalties are taxed exclusively in the residence country. Under the UN Model, the source country can impose withholding tax.

---

## F. OTHER NOTABLE DIFFERENCES

### 1. Capital Gains (Article 13)

The UN Model provides broader source-country taxing rights:

- **UN Article 13(5)** - Allows source taxation on gains from alienation of shares in companies whose assets consist principally of immovable property (land-rich company rule), with a lower threshold consideration
- **Alternative provisions** for taxation of substantial shareholdings

### 2. Article 1(3) - Saving Clause

Both the OECD MTC 2017 and UN MDTC 2021 contain saving clauses, but with important differences:

| Feature | UN MDTC | OECD MTC |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Excepted provisions** | Does not include Article 7(3); includes alternatives for Articles 18 and 25 | Includes Article 7(3) |
| **Commentary** | Adapted for UN-specific provisions | Standard OECD commentary |

### 3. Mutual Agreement Procedure (Article 25)

The UN Model includes **Alternative B** to Article 25 which provides for mandatory binding arbitration—but many developing countries reserve against this provision due to concerns about capacity and cost.

---

## G. THE UN MODEL IN PRACTICE

### 1. Countries Using UN Model as Basis

Developing countries typically prefer the UN Model for treaty negotiations:

| Region | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Africa** | Kenya, Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria, South Africa |
| **Asia** | India, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam |
| **Latin America** | Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina |

### 2. Hybrid Approaches

In practice, many DTAs combine elements from both Models:

- Developed-developing country treaties often use OECD structure with UN-style source taxation provisions
- Some provisions may follow OECD while others follow UN
- Bilateral negotiations determine the final balance

### 3. Challenges for Developing Countries

Despite the UN Model's favorable provisions, developing countries face challenges:

```
CHALLENGES IN DTC NEGOTIATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Negotiating Capacity
   • Limited specialized staff in tax treaty units
   • Developed countries have more experienced negotiators
   • Resource constraints for technical analysis

2. Information Asymmetry
   • Developed countries have better data on investment flows
   • Difficult to assess true cost-benefit of treaty provisions

3. Pressure to Conform
   • Pressure to adopt OECD provisions even when UN provisions
     would be more beneficial
   • Competition with other developing countries for investment

4. Administrative Capacity
   • Withholding tax systems require efficient administration
   • Exchange of information obligations demand resources

IMF Recommendation: Developing countries should conduct thorough
cost-benefit analysis before entering DTAs, critically assessing
whether agreements truly serve their interests.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 3. Common Exam Comparisons

**When asked to compare OECD and UN Models, structure your answer around:**

| Topic | Key Point |
|-------|-----------|
| **Philosophy** | UN favors source; OECD favors residence |
| **PE** | UN has broader definition (services PE, 6-month construction) |
| **Technical services** | UN has Article 12A; OECD has no equivalent |
| **Digital services** | UN has Article 12B; OECD relies on Pillar One (if implemented) |
| **Royalties** | UN allows source taxation; OECD gives exclusive residence taxation |
| **Article 14** | UN retains; OECD deleted in 2000 |
| **Withholding rates** | UN generally permits higher; OECD encourages lower |

## Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Treating UN and OECD Models as identical | Fundamental conceptual error | Always identify key differences when both Models are relevant |
| Forgetting Article 12A/12B exist | Misses UN-specific provisions | Check if technical services or digital services are involved |
| Applying OECD royalty treatment to UN context | Wrong allocation of taxing rights | UN allows source taxation on royalties; OECD does not |
| Ignoring services PE | Incomplete PE analysis | Always check for 183-day services PE under UN Model |
| Missing developing country context | Fails to show policy understanding | Explain why UN Model exists and its significance |
