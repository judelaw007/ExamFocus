## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE RESIDENCE CONCEPT

### 1.1 Purpose of Article 4

Article 4 defines **"resident of a Contracting State"** for treaty purposes. This definition is fundamental because:
- Article 1 limits treaty benefits to **residents** of Contracting States
- The residence State typically has **unlimited taxing rights** (worldwide income)
- The source State typically has **limited taxing rights** (source income only)
- Dual residence must be resolved to apply distributive rules

### 1.2 Relationship with Article 1

As covered in Chapter 6.1, Article 1 establishes that the treaty applies to **persons who are residents**. Article 4 provides the definition of "resident" that makes Article 1 operational.

## 2. ARTICLE 4 TEXT AND STRUCTURE

### 2.1 Article 4(1): Definition of Resident

**Article 4(1) OECD MTC**:
> *"For the purposes of this Convention, the term 'resident of a Contracting State' means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein."*

### 2.3 "Liable to Tax" Interpretation

**Commentary [4]**: The term "liable to tax" refers to **comprehensive liability** based on personal connection, not merely source-based taxation.

**Key issues**:
- Actual payment not required—potential liability suffices
- Tax-exempt entities may still be "liable to tax" (Commentary [8.6])
- Persons claiming treaty benefits must demonstrate residence status

## 3. ARTICLE 4(2): TIE-BREAKER FOR INDIVIDUALS

### 3.1 The Provision

**Article 4(2)**:
> *"Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:*
> *(a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests);*
> *(b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode;*
> *(c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national;*
> *(d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement."*

### 3.3 Commentary Guidance on Each Test

**Permanent Home (Commentary [13])**:
> *"As regards the concept of home, it should be observed that any form of home may be taken into account (house or apartment belonging to or rented by the individual, rented furnished room)."*

The home must be:
- **Available** to the individual at all times
- **Permanent** (not for short duration)
- Arranged and retained for permanent use

**Centre of Vital Interests (Commentary [15])**:
> *"If the individual has a permanent home in both Contracting States, it is necessary to look at the facts in order to ascertain with which of the two States his personal and economic relations are closer."*

Consider:
- Family and social relations
- Occupations
- Political, cultural activities
- Place of business/administration
- **Personal relations given more weight** if in conflict with economic

**Habitual Abode (Commentary [19])**:
> *"The comparison must cover a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to determine the frequency, duration and regularity of stays..."*

Not merely counting days—look at pattern and regularity of stays.

### 3.4 June 2025 Exam Application

The June 2025 Q5 tested residence determination for a student (Amelie) moving between States A and B:
- University accommodation: Term-by-term allocation, had to vacate between terms
- State A apartment: Owned, continuously available, cousin as caretaker
- Analysis required application of permanent home, centre of vital interests tests

## 4. ARTICLE 4(3): TIE-BREAKER FOR NON-INDIVIDUALS

### 4.1 The 2017 Change

**Pre-2017**: Dual resident companies deemed resident where **place of effective management (POEM)** located.

**Post-2017 (Article 4(3))**:
> *"Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Convention except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States."*

### 4.3 Place of Effective Management (POEM)

**Commentary [24]**:
> *"The place of effective management is the place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the entity's business as a whole are in substance made."*

**Factors indicating POEM**:
- Where board meetings held
- Where CEO/senior executives carry on activities
- Where day-to-day management occurs
- Where headquarters located
- Where accounting records kept

### 4.4 Consequences of Unresolved Dual Residence

**June 2025 exam reference**: *"Where under Article 4(3), an entity is treated as a dual resident, the competent authorities are only required to '[…] endeavour to determine […]' a single residence. If they fail to reach agreement, the person may lose DTA benefits."*

This can result in:
- Loss of all treaty benefits
- Double taxation
- Need for separate negotiations with each State

## 5. UN MDTC DIFFERENCES

### 5.1 Comparison

| Element | OECD MTC | UN MDTC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Article 4(1)** | Definition of resident | Identical |
| **Article 4(2)** | Individual tie-breaker | Identical |
| **Article 4(3)** | CA determination (2017) | Retains POEM as primary test |

### 5.2 UN Model Article 4(3)

The UN Model retains the **pre-2017 OECD approach**:
> *"...it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated."*

**Rationale**: Developing countries prefer the certainty of the POEM test over case-by-case CA determination.

### 6.1 How Article 4 Appears in Exams

Article 4 appears in:
1. **Residence determination scenarios** (June 2025 Q5)

3. **Treaty shopping questions** (residence as gateway)

### 6.3 Common Exam Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Applying tests out of sequence | Tests must be applied sequentially; only proceed if prior test inconclusive |
| Counting days for habitual abode | Commentary emphasizes frequency, duration, regularity—not just days |
| Ignoring "available" requirement | Permanent home must be continuously available, not just owned |
| Assuming POEM still determines corporate residence | Post-2017: CA determination required; POEM is one factor |
| Not distinguishing personal from economic relations | Personal relations given priority if conflict with economic |

*This note covers syllabus topic II.G.1: Meaning of "resident" and resolution of cases of dual residence – Article 4 (Level 3). Article 4(1) defines residence based on comprehensive tax liability under domestic law. Article 4(2) provides sequential tie-breaker rules for dual-resident individuals (permanent home → centre of vital interests → habitual abode → nationality → MAP). Article 4(3), revised in 2017, requires competent authority determination for dual-resident non-individuals, with potential loss of treaty benefits if no agreement is reached.*
