## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE UNIQUE STATUS OF ARTICLE 14

### 1.1 The Key Point

**EXAM TIP - Critical Distinction:**

Article 14 is **DELETED** from the OECD Model Tax Convention but **RETAINED** in the UN Model Double Taxation Convention.

```
ARTICLE 14 STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OECD MODEL (2017):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Article 14 was DELETED on 29 April 2000                       │

│  Independent personal services are now covered by:              │
│    • Article 5 (PE definition)                                 │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

UN MODEL (2021):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Article 14 is RETAINED                                         │

│  Independent personal services have SEPARATE treatment          │
│  with expanded source state taxing rights:                      │
│    • Fixed base test, OR                                       │

│  Reason: Favours developing (source) countries                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 1.2 Purpose of Article 14

Article 14 addresses the taxation of income from **independent personal services** - professional activities performed by individuals (and potentially entities) acting independently rather than as employees.

The article allocates taxing rights over such income between:
- **Residence state**: Where the professional is resident
- **Source state**: Where the services are performed

### 1.3 Why This Matters for ADIT

Understanding Article 14 requires knowledge of:
1. The **OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs report** that led to deletion
2. The **UN's decision to retain** the article
3. The distinction between "fixed base" and "permanent establishment"
4. The ongoing debate about scope (individuals vs entities)
5. Many bilateral treaties **still include Article 14** based on pre-2000 OECD Model

---

## 2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

### 2.1 Original Position

Article 14 appeared in the original OECD Model Convention (1963) and remained until 2000. It provided separate treatment for:
- Professional services
- Other activities of an independent character
- Distinguished from business profits (Article 7) and employment income (Article 15)

### 2.2 The OECD Deletion Decision (2000)

**Key Report:** "Issues Related to Article 14 of the OECD Model Tax Convention"
- Adopted by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs: 27 January 2000
- Article 14 deleted from OECD Model: 29 April 2000

```
REASONS FOR OECD DELETION OF ARTICLE 14
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. NO SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE IN THRESHOLD CONCEPTS
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   "There were no intended differences between the concepts of
    permanent establishment, as used in Article 7, and fixed base,
    as used in Article 14"

2. NO DIFFERENCE IN PROFIT COMPUTATION
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Profits were computed the same way whether under Article 7
   or Article 14

3. NO DIFFERENCE IN TAX CALCULATION
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Tax charged the same regardless of which article applied

4. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT SCOPE
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   It was not always clear which activities fell within Article 14
   as opposed to Article 7

CONCLUSION:
The OECD determined that maintaining two separate articles created
unnecessary complexity without any substantive benefit.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2.3 Effect of OECD Deletion

After the deletion:
- Income from professional services now falls under **Article 7** (Business profits)
- The "fixed base" concept was merged into the **PE concept** (Article 5)
- The OECD Commentary on Article 14 was retained as a "deleted article" commentary

**Commentary on Article 14 [Deleted] (OECD MTC 2017):**
> "The effect of the deletion of Article 14 is that income derived from professional services or other activities of an independent character is now dealt with under Article 7 as business profits."

### 2.4 UN Decision to Retain (2009)

The UN Committee of Experts considered whether to follow the OECD in 2009 but decided to **retain Article 14**:

```
UN REASONS FOR RETAINING ARTICLE 14
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. GREATER SOURCE TAXATION RIGHTS
   • 183-day threshold provides additional nexus beyond fixed base
   • Developing countries can tax professional services more readily

2. SEPARATE TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS
   • Personal services by individuals warrant distinct treatment
   • Different from corporate business activities

3. ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLICITY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
   • Fixed base/183-day test easier to administer than full PE analysis
   • Aligns with developing country capacity constraints

4. STATE PRACTICE
   • Many bilateral treaties retain Article 14
   • Developing countries prefer the additional taxing rights

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2.5 Academic Criticism

Some scholars have criticised the OECD's deletion:

> "Despite this assimilation, many states still prefer the OECD's pre-2000 approach. Many recent Double Tax Agreements continue to provide for the taxation of independent personal services in a separate article to that of business profits. Given the stark contrast between model treaty theory and state practice, some suggest the OECD made a mistake when it deleted Article 14 from the OECD Model."

---

## 3. ARTICLE 14 TEXT AND STRUCTURE (UN MODEL 2021)

### 3.1 Full Text

**UN Model Article 14:**

> "1. Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State from the performance of professional services or other independent activities shall be taxable only in that State. However, such income may also be taxed in the other Contracting State:
>
> (a) if the individual has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities; in that case, only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base may be taxed in that other Contracting State; or
>
> (b) if his stay in the other Contracting State is for a period or periods amounting to or exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 12-month period; in that case, only so much of the income as is derived from his activities performed in that other State may be taxed in that other State.
>
> 2. The term 'professional services' includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants."

### 3.2 Structure Overview

| Paragraph | Content | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **14(1) first sentence** | Basic rule | Residence state exclusive taxation |
| **14(1)(a)** | Fixed base test | Source taxation if fixed base exists |
| **14(1)(b)** | 183-day test | Source taxation if 183+ days present |
| **14(2)** | Definition | What "professional services" means |

---

## 4. ARTICLE 14(1): TAXING RIGHTS ALLOCATION

### 4.1 The Basic Rule (First Sentence)

> "Income derived by an individual... shall be taxable **only in that State**"

The default position grants the **residence state exclusive taxing rights** over independent personal services income.

The word "only" indicates that without meeting one of the exceptions, the source state cannot tax this income at all.

### 4.2 Exception (a): Fixed Base Test

```
THE FIXED BASE TEST - ARTICLE 14(1)(a)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fixed base must EXIST in source state
2. Fixed base must be REGULARLY AVAILABLE
3. Fixed base used for PURPOSE of performing activities

EFFECT:
Source state may tax income ATTRIBUTABLE to that fixed base

KEY INTERPRETATION - "REGULARLY AVAILABLE":
• The fixed base must be available to the individual
• Regardless of whether or not they actually USE it
• Must be available on more than temporary basis

EXAMPLES OF FIXED BASE:
• Consulting office
• Medical or dental surgery
• Law firm premises
• Studio for artists
• Workshop for craftsmen

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.3 Exception (b): 183-Day Test

```
THE 183-DAY TEST - ARTICLE 14(1)(b)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REQUIREMENTS:
• Stay in source state for 183 days or more
• In any 12-month period
• Days can be aggregated (need not be consecutive)

EFFECT:
Source state may tax income DERIVED FROM activities
performed in that state

KEY POINT:
This is an ALTERNATIVE threshold to the fixed base test
• No fixed base? Still taxable if 183+ days present
• This provides ADDITIONAL source taxation rights
• Not found in OECD Model (which only has PE threshold)

COUNTING DAYS:
• Physical presence counts
• Part-days typically count as full days
• Look at any rolling 12-month period

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.4 Comparison: Fixed Base vs PE

The core question that led to Article 14's deletion from the OECD Model:

```
FIXED BASE vs PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FIXED BASE (Article 14)           PE (Article 5)
─────────────────────────         ─────────────────────────
Used for: Individual              Used for: Enterprise
professional services             business activities

Requirements:                     Requirements:
• Fixed place                     • Fixed place of business
• Regularly available             • Through which business
• For performing activities         is carried on

Attribution:                      Attribution:
• Income attributable to          • Profits attributable to
  fixed base                        PE

OECD CONCLUSION (2000):
"There were no intended differences between the concepts"

→ Therefore, merged into PE/Article 7 framework

UN POSITION:
Retained separate treatment because:
• 183-day threshold provides additional source nexus
• Simpler test for developing country tax authorities
• State practice supports separate article

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 5. ARTICLE 14(2): PROFESSIONAL SERVICES DEFINITION

### 5.1 The Inclusive List

Article 14(2) provides a **non-exhaustive** definition:

> "The term 'professional services' includes **especially**..."

The word "especially" indicates these are primary examples, not an exhaustive list.

### 5.2 Categories of Professional Services

```
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES UNDER ARTICLE 14(2)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INDEPENDENT ACTIVITIES:                 PROFESSIONAL CATEGORIES:
────────────────────────────            ────────────────────────────
• Scientific activities                 • Physicians
• Literary activities                   • Lawyers
• Artistic activities                   • Engineers
• Educational activities                • Architects
• Teaching activities                   • Dentists
                                        • Accountants

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. INDEPENDENCE
   - Not performed as employee
   - Self-employed / freelance status
   - Personal responsibility for outcome

2. PROFESSIONAL NATURE
   - Requires specialised knowledge/skills
   - Often regulated profession
   - Personal expertise is key value

3. PERSONAL PERFORMANCE
   - Services rendered by the individual
   - Not through corporate structure (debated)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5.3 Distinguishing from Other Income Types

| Income Type | Applicable Article | Key Distinction |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Independent professional services** | Article 14 (UN) / Article 7 (OECD) | Self-employed, personal expertise |
| **Employment income** | Article 15 | Employer-employee relationship |
| **Business profits** | Article 7 | Enterprise activities, PE threshold |
| **Directors' fees** | Article 16 | Corporate directorship role |
| **Entertainers/sportspersons** | Article 17 | Specific categories, different rules |

---

## 6. SCOPE DEBATE: INDIVIDUALS VS ENTITIES

### 6.1 The Controversy

A significant interpretive dispute exists over Article 14's scope:

**Does Article 14 apply only to natural persons (individuals) or also to artificial persons (companies, partnerships)?**

```
THE SCOPE DEBATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NARROW VIEW: INDIVIDUALS ONLY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Arguments:
• Article 14(1) expressly refers to "an individual"
• UN Commentary states payments to artificial persons not covered
• Personal services concept implies human provider
• Different from "enterprise" in Article 7

Countries adopting: Many developing countries

BROAD VIEW: INCLUDES ENTITIES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Arguments:
• Companies can derive income from professional services
• No logical reason to distinguish based on legal form
• Prof. Klaus Vogel: "companies and other artificial persons are
  also capable of deriving income from professional services"
• Services substance should matter, not provider's legal form

Countries adopting: Various OECD countries (in pre-2000 practice)

OECD WORKING GROUP CONCLUSION:
"There is no justification for imposing different rules to services
depending on whether they were provided by a company or an individual"

→ This was one factor supporting deletion of Article 14

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 6.2 Practical Implications

If Article 14 applies **only to individuals**:
- Professional services company → Article 7 (business profits)
- Individual professional → Article 14

If Article 14 applies **to entities**:
- Both company and individual providing same services → Same treatment
- May create planning opportunities or complications

---

## 7. INTERACTION WITH OTHER ARTICLES

### 7.1 Article 14 and Article 7 (Business Profits)

```
ARTICLE 14 vs ARTICLE 7 RELATIONSHIP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

UNDER OECD MODEL (post-2000):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Article 14 does not exist
• All professional services income → Article 7
• PE threshold applies
• AOA profit attribution applies

UNDER UN MODEL:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Article 14 applies to independent personal services
• Article 7 applies to business profits (enterprise activities)
• Different thresholds:
  - Article 14: Fixed base OR 183 days
  - Article 7: PE

Priority:
• Article 14 is lex specialis for professional services
• If Article 14 applies, Article 7 does not

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 7.2 Article 14 and Passive Income Articles

Articles 10(4), 11(4), and 12(3) in the UN Model reference "fixed base":

> "...the beneficial owner... carries on... independent personal services from a **fixed base** situated therein..."

This creates a link between Article 14 and the passive income articles:
- If dividends/interest/royalties are effectively connected with a fixed base
- Article 14 applies instead of the WHT limitation articles

### 7.3 Article 14 and Article 15 (Employment Income)

```
ARTICLE 14 vs ARTICLE 15 DISTINCTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ARTICLE 14:                         ARTICLE 15:
Independent Personal Services       Employment Income
─────────────────────────           ─────────────────────────
• Self-employed                     • Employee
• Bears own risk                    • Employer bears risk
• Controls own work                 • Subject to employer direction
• Multiple clients possible         • Single employer relationship
• Provides own equipment            • Employer provides tools
• Freedom to hire helpers           • Works personally

KEY TEST: Nature of the relationship
• Independent contractor → Article 14
• Employee → Article 15

183-DAY COMPARISON:
Article 14(1)(b): 183 days triggers source taxation
Article 15(2)(a): 183 days exemption threshold (opposite effect!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## 8. STATE PRACTICE

### 8.1 Treaties Still Including Article 14

Despite OECD deletion, many bilateral treaties retain Article 14:

**Reasons:**
- Treaties negotiated before 2000
- Treaties with developing countries (UN-based)
- State preference for separate treatment
- Conservative approach to treaty revision

**Examples of jurisdictions commonly retaining Article 14:**
- India (in most treaties)
- Many African countries
- Several Asian countries
- Some Latin American countries

### 8.2 Variations in State Practice

| Approach | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **No Article 14** | Follow OECD post-2000 | Many intra-OECD treaties |
| **Article 14 without 183-day test** | Fixed base only | Some older treaties |
| **Article 14 with 183-day test** | Full UN Model approach | UN-based treaties |
| **Modified thresholds** | Different day counts | Negotiated bilaterally |

---

## 9. EXAM APPLICATION

### 9.1 How Article 14 May Appear in Exams

Given low direct exam frequency, Article 14 typically appears:
1. **In OECD vs UN Model comparison questions** - Key difference
2. **In historical/development questions** - OECD 2000 deletion
3. **In treaty interpretation context** - Pre-2000 vs post-2000 treaties
4. **In passive income effective connection** - Fixed base references
5. **In developing country treaty questions** - UN Model application

### 9.2 Answer Framework

```
ARTICLE 14 EXAM FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. IDENTIFY THE TREATY BASIS (2-3 marks)
   "First, determine whether the applicable treaty includes
    Article 14 (UN-based) or follows post-2000 OECD Model..."
   - If no Article 14 → Apply Article 7 (business profits)
   - If Article 14 exists → Continue analysis

2. CHARACTERISE THE INCOME (2-3 marks)
   "The income is from independent personal services because..."
   - Professional services / independent activities
   - Not employment (Article 15)
   - Not business enterprise (Article 7)

3. APPLY THRESHOLD TESTS (3-4 marks)
   "Under Article 14(1), the source state may tax if..."

   Test (a): Fixed base
   - Is there a fixed base in source state?
   - Is it regularly available?
   - Income attributable to fixed base?

   OR

   Test (b): 183 days
   - Presence for 183+ days?
   - In any 12-month period?
   - Income from activities performed there?

4. ALLOCATE TAXING RIGHTS (2-3 marks)
   "Based on the analysis..."
   - If neither threshold met → Residence state only
   - If threshold met → Source state may also tax
   - Attribution of income to source activities

5. NOTE OECD/UN DIFFERENCE (if relevant) (2 marks)
   "Under the OECD Model, Article 14 was deleted in 2000..."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 9.3 Common Exam Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Assuming all treaties have Article 14 | Check if treaty is OECD or UN-based |
| Confusing fixed base with PE | Fixed base for individuals; PE for enterprises |
| Missing 183-day alternative | UN Model has BOTH fixed base AND 183-day test |
| Confusing with Article 15 183-day rule | Article 14 = source taxation trigger; Article 15 = exemption threshold |
| Assuming Article 14 covers companies | Primarily individuals; entity scope is disputed |

*Chapter 10 covers syllabus area II.I - DTC provisions relating to independent personal services – Article 14, UN MDTC. This is a Level 3 topic requiring advanced knowledge of the historical deletion of Article 14 from the OECD Model (2000), the UN's retention of the article, the fixed base and 183-day thresholds, and the ongoing debate about the article's scope. Understanding this topic is essential for comparing the OECD and UN Model approaches and for interpreting bilateral treaties with developing countries.*
