## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE FINAL PROVISIONS

### 1.1 Purpose of Final Provisions

The final provisions of a DTC address the **temporal** and **territorial** scope of the treaty:
- **When** does the treaty start applying? (Entry into Force)
- **Where** does the treaty apply? (Territorial Extension)
- **When** does the treaty stop applying? (Termination)

These provisions ensure legal certainty about the treaty's operational boundaries.

**Note**: Article numbering changed in 2017. Earlier versions had:
- Article 29 = Territorial Extension
- Article 30 = Entry into Force
- Article 31 = Termination

---

## 2. ARTICLE 30: TERRITORIAL EXTENSION

### 2.1 Purpose

Article 30 allows Contracting States to extend the treaty's application to **territories** for whose international relations they are responsible (e.g., overseas territories, dependencies).

### 2.2 The Provision (OECD MTC 2017)

**Article 30(1)**:
> *"This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to any part of the territory of (State A) or of (State B) which is specifically excluded from the application of the Convention or to any State or territory for whose international relations (State A) or (State B) is responsible, which imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions, including conditions as to termination, as may be specified and agreed between the Contracting States in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels or in any other manner in accordance with their constitutional procedures."*

### 2.3 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Optional provision** | Not automatically included in all treaties |
| **Requires agreement** | Both States must agree to extension |
| **May be modified** | Extension can include "necessary modifications" |
| **Separate termination** | Extension can have its own termination rules |
| **Declining relevance** | Less common as fewer territories in this category |

### 2.4 Commentary Guidance

**Commentary [1]** notes this provision is relevant for:
- Territories specifically excluded from the Convention
- States or territories for whose international relations a Contracting State is responsible
- The provision has **declining practical importance** in modern times

### 2.5 UN MDTC Position

The UN Model does not include a territorial extension provision, reflecting:
- Most developing countries have unitary territorial structures
- Fewer overseas territories in treaty practice

---

## 3. ARTICLE 31: ENTRY INTO FORCE

### 3.1 Purpose

Article 31 specifies **when** the treaty becomes operational after signature. This is crucial because:
- Treaties require domestic ratification procedures
- Taxpayers need certainty about when provisions apply
- Both States must coordinate effective dates

### 3.2 The Provision (OECD MTC 2017)

**Article 31(1)** – Ratification:
> *"This Convention shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at .......... as soon as possible."*

**Article 31(2)** – Entry into Force:
> *"The Convention shall enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and its provisions shall have effect:"*
> - (a) in respect of taxes withheld at source: [dates specified]
> - (b) in respect of other taxes: [dates specified]

### 3.4 Entry into Force vs Entry into Effect

A critical distinction:

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Entry into Force** | When treaty becomes legally binding between States |
| **Entry into Effect** | When treaty provisions apply to specific taxes |

**Typical provisions**:
- **Withholding taxes**: Effect from amounts paid/credited on or after a specified date (often 1 January following entry into force)
- **Other taxes**: Effect for tax years beginning on or after a specified date

### 3.5 Commentary Guidance

**Commentary [1]**:
> *"Notification through diplomatic channels is advisable as it clarifies that casual notifications are not sufficient to bring the treaty into force, thus reducing the chance of disagreements regarding when the treaty entered into force."*

**Commentary [2]** notes variations in practice:
- Some treaties specify months after exchange of instruments
- Others specify calendar year dates
- Provisions should be clear to avoid disputes

### 3.6 Practical Implications

Entry into force timing matters for:
- When treaty relief becomes available
- Application of exchange of information provisions
- Assistance in collection (June 2025 exam noted: *"AIC is requested after the DTA becomes effective"*)
- Transitional arrangements for existing situations

---

## 4. ARTICLE 32: TERMINATION

### 4.1 Purpose

Article 32 establishes how either Contracting State may **end** the treaty. This ensures:
- Neither State is bound indefinitely
- Orderly termination process
- Continuation of treaty for reasonable period after notice

### 4.2 The Provision (OECD MTC 2017)

**Article 32**:
> *"This Convention shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year after the year............ In such event, the Convention shall cease to have effect:"*
> - (a) in respect of taxes withheld at source: [specified date]
> - (b) in respect of other taxes: [specified date]

### 4.4 Vienna Convention Context

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) provides the general international law framework:
- Termination may occur per treaty provisions or by agreement
- If no termination clause, denunciation requires proof of party intent
- Orderly termination protects reliance interests

### 4.5 Recent Treaty Terminations

Recent examples demonstrate practical significance:

| Country | Action | Context |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Burkina Faso** | Terminated treaty with France | Renegotiation request refused; terminated 2024 |
| **Mali** | Terminated treaty with France | Similar circumstances |
| **Niger** | Terminated treaty with France | Similar circumstances |
| **South Africa** | Renegotiated several treaties | Concerns about treaty benefits to residence States |

**Commentary**: Termination is typically a last resort. As the 1989 OECD report noted: *"termination could do even more harm economically and endanger the possibility of finding an acceptable solution in the future."*

### 4.6 Termination vs Renegotiation

| Option | Description | Implications |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Renegotiation** | Modify existing treaty | Preserves relationship; takes time |
| **Termination** | End treaty entirely | May create double taxation; damages relations |
| **Protocol** | Amend specific provisions | Faster than full renegotiation |

---

## 5. UN MDTC PROVISIONS

### 5.1 Comparison with OECD MTC

| Provision | OECD MTC | UN MDTC |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Territorial Extension** | Article 30 | Not included |
| **Entry into Force** | Article 31 | Article 30 |
| **Termination** | Article 32 | Article 31 |

### 5.2 Substantive Differences

The provisions are **substantively similar** between models:
- Both require ratification and exchange of instruments
- Both provide for notice period before termination
- Both distinguish between withholding taxes and other taxes

UN Model omits territorial extension as less relevant for developing countries.

---

## 6. EXAM APPLICATION

### 6.1 How These Topics Appear in Exams

These provisions typically appear:
- As **context** for other questions (e.g., when does treaty apply?)
- In **MLI questions** (modifying existing treaty provisions)
- In **assistance in collection** questions (temporal scope)
- In **policy questions** about treaty renegotiation

│  1. DISTINGUISH ENTRY INTO FORCE FROM ENTRY INTO EFFECT         │
│     • Force = treaty legally binding                            │

│  2. TERMINATION REQUIRES NOTICE                                 │
│     • Minimum 6 months before end of calendar year              │
│     • Through diplomatic channels                               │
│     • Cannot terminate before minimum period expires            │

│  3. WITHHOLDING TAXES VS OTHER TAXES                            │
│     • Different effective dates typically                       │
│     • WHT: amounts paid/credited after date                     │
│     • Other: tax years beginning after date                     │
│                                                                 │
│  4. TERRITORIAL EXTENSION (ARTICLE 30)                          │
│     • Optional provision                                        │
│     • Declining practical relevance                             │

### 6.3 Common Exam Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Confusing entry into force with entry into effect | Force = binding; Effect = applies to taxes |
| Ignoring notice period for termination | 6 months minimum required |
| Assuming immediate termination | Treaty continues until end of notice period |
| Overlooking transitional provisions | Entry into effect may differ by tax type |

*This note covers syllabus topic II.F.4: Territorial Extension, Entry into Force, and Termination (Level 2). Article 30 permits extension of the treaty to overseas territories. Article 31 specifies when the treaty enters into force (upon exchange of ratification instruments) and when provisions take effect. Article 32 allows either State to terminate the treaty with 6 months' notice through diplomatic channels. These provisions establish the temporal boundaries of treaty application.*
