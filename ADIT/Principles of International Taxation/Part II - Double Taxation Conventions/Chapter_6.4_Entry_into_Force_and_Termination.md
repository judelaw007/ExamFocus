# Chapter 6.4: Scope of a DTC – Territorial Extension, Entry into Force, and Termination

## 1. The Final Provisions

The final provisions of a double taxation convention address the temporal and territorial boundaries of treaty application. While the substantive provisions determine how income and capital are taxed, the final provisions determine when and where those rules apply. These provisions establish when the treaty becomes operational, whether it extends to overseas territories, and how it may be brought to an end.

The OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 addresses these matters in Articles 30, 31, and 32. Article 30, positioned at the end of Chapter VI (Special Provisions), deals with territorial extension. Articles 31 and 32 constitute Chapter VII (Final Provisions), addressing entry into force and termination respectively. The article numbering changed in 2017; earlier versions used Articles 29, 30, and 31 for these provisions.

These provisions may seem merely procedural, but they have significant practical consequences. Taxpayers need certainty about when treaty benefits become available. Tax authorities need clarity about when their obligations under the treaty commence. And both States need mechanisms to exit the treaty if circumstances change.

## 2. Article 30: Territorial Extension

### 2.1. Purpose and Scope

Article 30 allows a Contracting State to extend the treaty's application to territories for whose international relations it is responsible. These may include overseas territories, dependencies, or associated states that are not themselves parties to the treaty.

The provision contemplates that such extension may be made either in the treaty's entirety or with necessary modifications, and that the extension may have its own effective dates and termination provisions. Extension requires agreement between both Contracting States, typically through exchange of diplomatic notes.

The rationale is that some territories have distinct tax systems from their metropolitan State and would not automatically benefit from treaties concluded by that State. Without an extension mechanism, residents of such territories would be unable to access treaty benefits, even though the metropolitan State is a treaty party.

### 2.2. Declining Relevance

Commentary paragraph 1 notes that this provision has declining practical importance. The number of territories in the relevant category has diminished as former colonies and dependencies have become independent States capable of concluding their own treaties. Most contemporary treaty networks involve States with unitary territorial structures where the question of extension does not arise.

The UN Model does not include a territorial extension provision, reflecting that developing countries typically have unitary structures without overseas territories requiring separate treatment. For most treaty negotiations today, Article 30 is omitted or included only as a placeholder for potential future use.

## 3. Article 31: Entry into Force

### 3.1. Ratification and Exchange of Instruments

Article 31 specifies the process by which a treaty becomes legally binding. Signature alone does not bring a treaty into force; each State must complete its domestic ratification procedures, which may include parliamentary approval, executive action, or other constitutional requirements.

Article 31(1) provides that the Convention shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification exchanged as soon as possible. The exchange of instruments is a formal diplomatic act confirming that both States have completed their domestic procedures. Article 31(2) provides that the Convention enters into force upon this exchange.

The time between signature and ratification varies considerably. Some treaties enter into force within months of signature; others remain unratified for years. The delay typically reflects domestic political considerations, legislative calendars, or changing circumstances that affect the treaty's desirability.

### 3.2. Entry into Force versus Entry into Effect

A critical distinction exists between entry into force and entry into effect. Entry into force is the moment when the treaty becomes legally binding between the Contracting States as a matter of international law. Entry into effect is when the treaty's provisions actually begin to apply to specific taxes.

These dates typically differ. A treaty might enter into force on the date of exchange of instruments but have effect for withholding taxes only from 1 January of the following year, and for other taxes only for fiscal years beginning after that date. This allows time for administrative implementation and taxpayer planning.

### 3.3. Effective Date Provisions

Article 31(2) typically distinguishes between different categories of taxes for effective date purposes.

For taxes withheld at source (primarily withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties), the treaty typically takes effect in respect of amounts paid or credited on or after a specified date. This date is often 1 January of the year following entry into force.

For other taxes on income and capital (primarily income taxes assessed on annual returns), the treaty typically takes effect for taxable years beginning on or after a specified date. This ensures that complete tax years are governed by either the old rules or the new treaty, avoiding mid-year transitions.

Commentary paragraph 4 notes that the specific dates depend largely on the domestic laws of the Contracting States. Different fiscal years, assessment systems, and administrative practices mean that uniform effective dates may not be practical. The Platform for Collaboration on Tax has published examples of entry-into-force provisions illustrating the range of approaches used in practice.

## 4. Article 32: Termination

### 4.1. The Termination Mechanism

Article 32 establishes a unilateral right for either Contracting State to terminate the treaty. Neither State is bound indefinitely; the treaty continues only so long as both States are content with the arrangement.

The termination mechanism includes several elements. First, a minimum period during which termination is not possible—typically five years from entry into force. This protects reliance interests by ensuring the treaty operates for a reasonable initial period. Second, a notice requirement: the terminating State must give at least six months' notice before the end of a calendar year. Third, formal channel requirements: notice must be given through diplomatic channels.

Once proper notice is given, the treaty ceases to have effect according to the terms specified in the article. As with entry into effect, different dates typically apply to withholding taxes and other taxes.

### 4.2. Vienna Convention Context

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 provides the general international law framework for treaty termination. Article 54 confirms that termination may occur in conformity with treaty provisions or by consent of all parties. Article 56 addresses treaties containing no termination provision: such treaties cannot be denounced unless the parties intended to permit denunciation or a right is implied by the treaty's nature.

Tax treaties typically include their own termination provisions, so Article 56 rarely applies directly. However, the Vienna Convention's requirement of 12 months' notice for treaties without termination provisions influenced the OECD Model's approach. The six-month notice period in Article 32 is shorter than the Vienna Convention default, reflecting the bilateral and relatively technical nature of tax treaties.

### 4.3. Recent Treaty Terminations

Treaty termination is typically a last resort. As the OECD observed in 1989, termination could cause economic harm and endanger future cooperative solutions. Most disputes are resolved through renegotiation, protocol amendments, or competent authority procedures rather than termination.

However, recent developments have seen notable terminations. In 2023-2024, three West African countries—Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger—terminated their tax treaties with France. Burkina Faso notified denunciation in August 2023, with the treaty terminated effective January 1, 2025. Mali notified in December 2023, also terminated January 1, 2025. Niger's denunciation took effect June 2024, though France considers the treaty suspended rather than formally terminated due to questions about the government's authority to act.

These terminations raise procedural issues. The treaties required six months' notice before the end of a calendar year, but the actual notice periods were shorter. France responded by treating the treaties as suspended, applying them from the perspective of French taxpayers until the formal termination dates arrived.

The terminations also illustrate broader policy dynamics. The three countries had legitimate concerns about the treaties' terms, including withholding rates and allocation of taxing rights. However, the terminations occurred in a context of political tensions that extended well beyond tax policy. Commentators have suggested these terminations may signal changing attitudes among Global South countries toward treaty networks that they perceive as unduly favouring residence States.

## 5. UN Model Provisions

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention 2021 addresses entry into force and termination in Articles 30 and 31 respectively. The article numbers differ from the OECD Model because the UN Model does not include territorial extension, eliminating one article from the sequence.

Substantively, the UN Model provisions are similar to their OECD equivalents. Both require ratification and exchange of instruments. Both distinguish between withholding taxes and other taxes for effective date purposes. Both permit unilateral termination with appropriate notice.

The absence of territorial extension in the UN Model reflects its focus on developing countries, which typically have unitary territorial structures. For these countries, the question of extending treaty benefits to overseas territories simply does not arise.

## 6. MLI and Entry into Force

The Multilateral Instrument adds complexity to entry into force analysis. The MLI entered into force on July 1, 2018, three months after Slovenia became the fifth State to deposit its ratification instrument. However, the MLI's modifications to any particular bilateral treaty take effect only when both treaty partners have ratified the MLI and notified that treaty as a Covered Tax Agreement.

This creates a layered entry-into-force structure. The MLI itself is in force as a matter of international law. But its impact on any specific treaty depends on whether both parties have completed the necessary steps. As of 2024, over 100 jurisdictions have signed the MLI, covering more than 1,400 bilateral treaties. However, the United States has not signed, meaning that US tax treaties are not modified by the MLI.

The MLI also introduces its own timing rules for when its modifications take effect. These interact with the original treaty's entry-into-force provisions to produce potentially complex transitional situations. The OECD provides synthesised texts showing how specific treaties read after MLI modification, but practitioners must trace through both instruments to determine applicable dates.

## 7. Practical Implications

The timing provisions have significant practical consequences for taxpayers and advisers. When structuring cross-border transactions, it is essential to verify not only whether a treaty exists but also whether it has entered into effect for the relevant taxes. A treaty signed but not yet ratified provides no current benefits. A treaty recently terminated may still apply to amounts paid before the termination date.

The distinction between entry into force and entry into effect requires careful attention. A taxpayer seeking reduced withholding rates must confirm that the treaty applies to amounts paid on the relevant date, not merely that the treaty is in force as an international law matter. Different effective dates for withholding taxes versus other taxes mean that the same treaty may apply to a dividend payment but not yet to an annual income tax assessment in the same period.

Exchange of information and assistance in collection provisions also depend on entry-into-effect timing. These administrative provisions typically take effect from the entry into force date rather than having delayed effective dates. This means that information exchange may be available before the substantive tax provisions take effect, enabling tax authorities to verify eligibility for treaty benefits that will become available in future periods.

Treaty termination creates transitional challenges. Taxpayers who have structured their affairs in reliance on treaty benefits must reassess their positions when termination is announced. The notice period—typically six months—provides limited time for restructuring. Where termination results from political tensions, as in the West African examples, the termination may be announced with minimal practical warning despite the formal notice requirements.
