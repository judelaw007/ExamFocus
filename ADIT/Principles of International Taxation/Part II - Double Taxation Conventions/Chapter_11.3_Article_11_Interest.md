# Chapter 11.3: Interest – Article 11, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Policy Rationale

### 1.1. The Role of Article 11

Article 11 allocates taxing rights over interest income between the source state (where the payer is resident) and the residence state (where the beneficial owner is resident). Like Article 10 for dividends, Article 11 establishes a shared allocation approach with limited source taxation through capped withholding tax rates, reflecting the passive nature of interest income.

Interest represents the return on capital lent—compensation paid by a borrower for the temporary use of another party's money. This fundamental characteristic distinguishes interest from dividends, which represent a share of business profits dependent on company performance. Interest arises from a contractual obligation to repay principal with additional compensation for the use of funds, while dividends arise from ownership of an enterprise with no repayment obligation.

### 1.2. Policy Rationale for Shared Allocation

The OECD Commentary explains that the shared allocation for interest reflects competing interests between capital-exporting and capital-importing countries. Source states contribute infrastructure and legal systems that enable debt financing and support economic activity generating interest payments. Residence states bear the administrative costs of taxing their residents on worldwide income and argue that capital export neutrality requires residence-based taxation.

The compromise permits both states to tax interest income. The source state may impose withholding tax up to a specified rate, while the residence state retains unlimited taxing rights subject to providing double taxation relief. The OECD Model limits source taxation to ten percent of gross interest, though this rate is negotiable and many treaties provide lower rates or complete exemptions.

### 1.3. Comparison with Article 12

Article 11 differs significantly from Article 12 covering royalties. Under the OECD Model, royalties are subject to exclusive residence state taxation with no source state withholding permitted. Interest retains limited source taxation, reflecting the historical importance of cross-border lending and the difficulty of completely eliminating source state claims over income with strong territorial connections to the debtor's jurisdiction.

## 2. Treaty Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 11(1): Residence State Right

Article 11(1) provides: "Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

This grants the residence state the right to tax interest without limitation. The language "may be taxed" creates permission rather than obligation—the residence state has the right but is not required to exercise it. The provision establishes that interest must "arise" in one Contracting State and be paid to a resident of the other, ensuring bilateral application.

### 2.2. Article 11(2): Source State Right

Article 11(2) provides: "However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest."

The source state may tax interest but is limited to ten percent of the gross amount if the beneficial owner is a resident of the other Contracting State. This rate cap applies only when the beneficial ownership condition is satisfied. Without beneficial ownership, domestic law rates apply without treaty limitation.

### 2.3. Subsequent Paragraphs

Article 11(3) defines "interest" for treaty purposes, using a broad formulation covering income from debt-claims of every kind. Article 11(4) establishes source rules determining where interest "arises" for treaty purposes. Article 11(5) provides the permanent establishment exception, displacing Article 11 in favour of Article 7 where interest is effectively connected with a PE. Article 11(6) addresses special relationships and non-arm's length interest payments.

## 3. Definition of Interest

### 3.1. Treaty Definition

Article 11(3) defines interest as "income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures."

This broad definition encompasses income from any debt instrument regardless of security or profit participation features. Government securities, corporate bonds, and debentures are explicitly included. The definition also covers premiums and prizes attaching to debt instruments.

### 3.2. Characterisation Issues

The distinction between debt and equity determines whether a payment falls under Article 11 (interest) or Article 10 (dividends). Hybrid instruments with characteristics of both require careful analysis. The key distinguishing features include whether principal is repayable, whether returns are fixed or profit-dependent, and how the instrument ranks on liquidation.

Profit-participating loans explicitly fall within Article 11 despite their equity-like profit participation feature, provided principal remains repayable. Penalty interest for late payment is generally excluded from Article 11 as it compensates for damages rather than representing income from capital. The December 2025 examination addressed characterisation between dividends and interest for hybrid financing instruments.

## 4. The Beneficial Owner Requirement

### 4.1. Purpose and Function

The beneficial owner requirement serves as an anti-avoidance mechanism preventing treaty shopping through conduit arrangements. Without this requirement, a third-country investor could interpose a resident of a Contracting State to receive interest and pass it on, claiming reduced withholding tax rates despite the ultimate investor having no treaty entitlement.

The Commentary clarifies that "beneficial owner" has an international fiscal meaning, not determined by any single country's domestic law. The beneficial owner is the person with the right to use and enjoy the interest without contractual or legal obligation to pass the payment to another person.

### 4.2. Recent Case Law Developments

The Danish Supreme Court's decision in Cook Denmark International Holdings ApS (September 2024) addressed beneficial ownership for interest payments. The case involved interest on debt instruments totalling EUR 900 million paid to a Swedish parent company. The Court held that Cook Sweden Finance AB was not the beneficial owner, finding it to be a conduit company. Significantly, the Court also found Cook Sweden Finance's parent company was not the beneficial owner either, applying a two-tier conduit analysis.

The UK Court of Appeal's decision in Hargreaves Property Holdings Ltd v HMRC (2024) addressed beneficial entitlement under domestic tax law. The Court found that an entity whose sole purpose was to provide tax advantage, with no commercial purpose or practical effect, was not beneficially entitled to interest payments. This represents the most structured judicial attempt to rationalize the beneficial ownership concept in UK domestic tax law.

A Belgian court decision in 2024 involving EUR 39.12 million in interest payments denied withholding tax exemption under the Interest and Royalties Directive for a back-to-back financing structure where the Dutch financing company was found to be a conduit. The court adopted the CJEU definition that beneficial owner designates an entity which actually benefits economically from interest received, not merely the formally identified recipient.

### 4.3. Back-to-Back Financing

Back-to-back financing arrangements present particular beneficial ownership challenges. Where Company A lends to Company B, which immediately on-lends to Company C on matching terms, Company B likely fails the beneficial ownership test because it has no real economic stake in the interest. The substance-over-form approach examines whether the intermediary bears genuine credit risk, earns a spread, and exercises independent decision-making regarding the on-lending.

## 5. Source Rules and Permanent Establishment Exception

### 5.1. Article 11(4) Source Rules

Article 11(4) establishes where interest "arises" for treaty purposes. Interest is deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that state, or when the payer has a permanent establishment in that state and the debt was incurred in connection with that PE.

If a German company pays interest to a UK creditor, the interest arises in Germany, giving Germany source taxation rights subject to the ten percent limitation. If a UK company has a PE in Germany and that PE borrows money, interest paid by the PE arises in Germany even though the company is UK resident.

### 5.2. Article 11(5) PE Exception

Article 11(5) provides that where the beneficial owner has a PE in the source state and the debt-claim is effectively connected with that PE, Article 11 does not apply. Instead, Article 7 governs and the interest is treated as business profits attributable to the PE, subject to full taxation at corporate rates rather than limited withholding rates.

Effective connection requires more than merely recording the debt-claim in the PE's books. There must be genuine business connection between the lending activity and the PE's operations. This provision prevents taxpayers from artificially separating interest income from PE activities to access lower withholding rates.

## 6. Special Relationships – Article 11(6)

### 6.1. Operation of Article 11(6)

Article 11(6) addresses non-arm's length interest in special relationship situations. Where the amount of interest exceeds what would have been agreed between independent parties due to a special relationship between payer and beneficial owner, treaty benefits apply only to the arm's length portion.

The special relationship concept includes associated enterprises but extends more broadly to any relationship affecting the interest rate. The excess interest above arm's length is taxed according to domestic law and other treaty provisions, potentially including recharacterisation as a dividend under Article 10.

### 6.2. Interaction with Article 9 and Domestic Rules

Article 11(6) complements rather than replaces Article 9. Article 9 allows adjustment of profits for transfer pricing purposes, while Article 11(6) addresses treaty qualification of the payment. The 2025 OECD Model Tax Convention update significantly reworked the Commentary on Article 9, clarifying that domestic thin capitalisation and interest limitation rules can apply even where interest is arm's length. This confirms that treaty provisions do not prevent application of BEPS Action 4 interest limitation rules.

## 7. UN Model Differences

### 7.1. Key Distinctions

The UN Model differs from the OECD Model in that it does not specify a withholding tax rate for interest, leaving this to bilateral negotiation. The UN Commentary explains that the OECD's ten percent rate may result in excessive revenue loss for developing countries, which are typically net importers of capital and net payers of interest to foreign lenders.

The UN Model includes the same beneficial ownership requirement, source rules, and PE exception as the OECD Model. However, the policy balance differs, recognising that developing countries have greater interest in preserving source taxation on interest flowing outward to developed country lenders.

### 7.2. The 2025 UN Model Update

The 2025 UN Model update introduced a Subject to Tax Rule denying treaty benefits for income subject to no or very low taxation in the residence country. This protects source country taxing rights when interest is not meaningfully taxed elsewhere, addressing situations where reduced source taxation produces double non-taxation rather than eliminating double taxation.

## 8. BEPS Action 4 Interest Limitation

### 8.1. The Problem Addressed

BEPS Action 4 addresses base erosion through excessive interest deductions. Multinational groups can allocate high third-party debt to high-tax jurisdictions, use intra-group loans to shift profits via interest deductions, and finance tax-exempt income with deductible interest. Interest deductions are particularly attractive for BEPS because they are easy to implement and may not affect consolidated accounts.

### 8.2. The Fixed Ratio Rule

The primary mechanism limits net interest deductions to a fixed percentage of tax-EBITDA within a ten to thirty percent corridor. Countries choose their benchmark ratio based on policy objectives. The rule applies to both third-party and intra-group interest, preventing circumvention through external borrowing at the group level with internal allocation of debt to high-tax subsidiaries.

The fixed ratio approach offers simplicity and predictability compared to arm's length analysis of individual transactions. However, the thirty percent corridor has been criticised as potentially too generous, given that most large multinational enterprises outside financial services maintain net interest to EBITDA ratios below ten percent.

### 8.3. The Group Ratio Rule

Recognising that some groups are legitimately highly leveraged for non-tax reasons, Action 4 provides an optional group ratio rule. This allows entities to deduct net interest up to the group's worldwide net third-party interest to EBITDA ratio, aligning individual entity treatment with group-level economic reality.

Capital-intensive industries including utilities and infrastructure may legitimately require higher leverage than the fixed ratio permits. The group ratio rule accommodates these situations while maintaining anti-avoidance objectives.

### 8.4. Global Implementation

As of 2025, 106 jurisdictions within the Inclusive Framework have implemented interest limitation rules, representing a fifty-eight percent increase from 67 jurisdictions in 2019. The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive required all Member States to implement interest limitation rules by January 2024, typically at thirty percent of EBITDA. The Netherlands increased its threshold from twenty to 24.5 percent effective January 2025, demonstrating continued national variation within the OECD framework. The European Commission launched a public consultation in July 2024 regarding potential revision of the interest limitation rules, with recommendations including raising the de minimis threshold and potentially allowing carve-outs for third-party debt.

## 9. Key States' Approaches

### 9.1. United States

The United States imposes thirty percent withholding tax on interest paid to non-residents under domestic law, with reduced rates available through tax treaties. Section 163(j) implements BEPS Action 4 through limiting business interest deductions to thirty percent of adjusted taxable income. Recent amendments effective for tax years beginning after December 2024 modify the calculation by adding back depreciation, amortisation, and depletion to adjusted taxable income.

### 9.2. United Kingdom

The United Kingdom requires withholding tax deduction on interest payments unless HMRC authorises gross payment or treaty relief applies. Banks and financial institutions normally pay interest to non-residents free of withholding. Most UK treaties provide zero-rate withholding on interest to governmental lenders, with many treaties providing full exemption. The withholding tax rate on UK interest is proposed to increase to twenty-two percent from April 2027.

### 9.3. Germany

Germany imposes limited withholding tax scope on interest, with only interest paid by banks to residents subject to withholding. Interest to non-residents is generally free of withholding except for convertible and profit-sharing bonds, which bear twenty-five percent tax plus solidarity surcharge. Interest on loans secured by German property may be subject to fifteen percent corporation tax plus solidarity surcharge on net income.

### 9.4. France

France generally does not require withholding on interest since March 2010. Where withholding applies, the standard rate is sixteen percent for corporate recipients and 12.8 percent for individuals. Payments to non-cooperative states or territories face seventy-five percent withholding. France maintains a broad treaty network typically reducing these rates.

## 10. Recent Developments

### 10.1. EU FASTER Directive (December 2024)

The EU Council formally adopted the FASTER Directive on 10 December 2024, establishing streamlined procedures for withholding tax relief on dividends and interest on publicly-traded bonds. The directive introduces digital tax residence certificates valid for multiple refund claims during the same calendar year, with member states required to issue certificates within fourteen calendar days.

The directive requires member states to implement either relief-at-source or quick refund procedures, with the quick refund process limited to fifty days. Large EU financial intermediaries must register under the system, with voluntary registration for smaller EU and non-EU intermediaries. Member states must transpose the directive by December 2028 for application from January 2030.

### 10.2. 2025 OECD Model Tax Convention Update

The 2025 OECD Model update significantly reworked the Commentary on Article 9, with important implications for interest taxation. The update confirms that domestic interest limitation rules are compatible with treaty obligations, provided they align with arm's length outcomes. The Commentary clarifies that once profits are allocated according to the arm's length principle, deductibility of expenses including interest remains a domestic law matter subject to Article 24 non-discrimination provisions.

The update also addresses interest paid to connected persons benefiting from notional deductions, providing that Contracting States may include specific provisions to prevent Article 11 application in such circumstances.

### 10.3. Principal Purpose Test Application

The Principal Purpose Test introduced under BEPS Action 6 and implemented through the MLI continues to be applied to interest payments. India's Central Board of Direct Taxes issued guidance in January 2025 clarifying that the PPT applies prospectively from treaty effective dates, with grandfathered clauses excluded from PPT scope. This guidance addressed implementation of the 2024 India-Mauritius protocol and provides important precedent for the prospective application of the PPT to cross-border interest flows.
