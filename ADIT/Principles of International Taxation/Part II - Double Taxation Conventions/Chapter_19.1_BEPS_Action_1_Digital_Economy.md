# Chapter 19.1: BEPS Action 1 – Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy

## 1. Introduction and Action 1 Framework

### 1.1. The Action 1 Final Report

BEPS Action 1 addressed tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy, recognising that traditional international tax rules developed for a physical economy face fundamental challenges when applied to digital business models. The October 2015 Final Report identified significant tax policy concerns but reached a measured conclusion: ring-fencing digital businesses from other activities was neither appropriate nor feasible.

This conclusion reflected the difficulty of distinguishing digital from non-digital activities in an increasingly digitalised economy. Rather than implementing radical reforms immediately, Action 1 deferred comprehensive nexus changes to subsequent work, setting the stage for the Two-Pillar Solution that emerged from the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework in 2021.

### 1.2. The Digitalisation Continuum

The Final Report recognised that digitalisation exists on a continuum—virtually all businesses now use digital technologies to some extent. Pure digital businesses (online platforms, cloud services, social media) represent one end, but traditional businesses also increasingly rely on digital channels for sales, customer engagement, and operations. This continuum makes artificial distinctions between digital and non-digital activities problematic for tax purposes.

The inability to isolate the digital economy for special treatment led to two parallel approaches: addressing tax challenges that are exacerbated by digitalisation (through the Two-Pillar Solution) and broader measures applying across all sectors (such as the beneficial ownership and anti-abuse provisions implemented through the MLI).

## 2. Characteristics of Digital Business Models

### 2.1. Reliance on Intangibles

Digital businesses generate value primarily through intellectual property, algorithms, software, and proprietary technology. Unlike traditional manufacturing where physical assets drive production, digital enterprises depend on intangible assets that can be developed, held, and exploited remotely. This characteristic enables businesses to locate valuable intangibles in low-tax jurisdictions while operating globally, creating opportunities for base erosion through transfer pricing arrangements.

### 2.2. Heavy Use of Data

Data monetisation constitutes a primary revenue source for many digital platforms. User data represents significant commercial value, with platforms harvesting behavioural information, preferences, and transaction histories to generate advertising revenue, improve services, and create new products. The value of data is explicitly recognised in the UN Model's Article 12B, which includes user data supply among covered automated digital services.

The difficulty of valuing data contributions within traditional transfer pricing frameworks creates challenges for profit allocation. Users create value by providing data and engaging with platforms, but this value is difficult to quantify and attribute to specific jurisdictions.

### 2.3. Scale Without Mass

Digital platforms achieve global reach with minimal physical infrastructure. A single platform can serve billions of users worldwide with marginal cost per additional user approaching zero. This characteristic—massive scale without proportional physical presence—fundamentally challenges permanent establishment concepts designed for businesses requiring fixed places of business to operate.

### 2.4. Network Effects and Multi-Sided Models

Digital platforms often operate as intermediaries connecting multiple user groups. Social media platforms connect users with advertisers. Marketplace platforms connect buyers with sellers. Payment platforms connect consumers with merchants. Value creation depends on participation across multiple sides, with network effects creating winner-take-most dynamics where dominant platforms face minimal competition.

Revenue may derive from one user group (advertisers) while value is created through engagement of others (content consumers). This multi-sided structure complicates the attribution of income to specific jurisdictions and user categories.

## 3. Tax Challenges Identified

### 3.1. Nexus and Permanent Establishment Avoidance

Traditional permanent establishment concepts require a fixed place of business through which business is wholly or partly carried on. Digital enterprises can generate substantial revenue from customers in countries without establishing any physical presence meeting this threshold. Online advertising platforms, streaming services, social media networks, and cloud computing services operate globally while maintaining minimal local infrastructure.

The permanent establishment threshold creates incentives to disconnect the location of economic activity (where customers are located and revenue is generated) from the location of taxation (where the enterprise is resident). Enterprises can structure operations so that significant economic activity occurs in market jurisdictions without triggering source-country taxation.

### 3.2. Data and User Participation Value

The value created by user participation and data provision is difficult to capture within traditional profit allocation frameworks. Transfer pricing rules focus on functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed by entities within multinational groups. User contributions to platform value fall outside these categories—users are not related parties, and their contributions do not fit standard transfer pricing methodology.

This gap means that value created through user engagement in market jurisdictions may be attributed entirely to headquarters jurisdictions where platforms are developed and managed, regardless of where users generating that value are located (covered in December 2024).

### 3.3. Income Characterisation

Digital transactions blur traditional distinctions between income categories. Cloud computing services may qualify as royalties (licences to use software), technical services (provision of computing capability), or business profits depending on contract structure and domestic law characterisation. Software-as-a-service, platform intermediation, and data licensing transactions lack clear classification within treaty categories developed for a pre-digital economy.

These characterisation difficulties create planning opportunities—enterprises may structure transactions to achieve favourable characterisation—and compliance uncertainties where different jurisdictions characterise the same transaction differently.

### 3.4. VAT/GST Collection Challenges

Cross-border digital services create value-added tax compliance challenges. Place of supply rules determine which jurisdiction can tax consumption, but digital services may be consumed in jurisdictions where suppliers have no presence or registration. Business-to-consumer digital services require foreign suppliers to register for VAT in customer jurisdictions, creating compliance burdens and collection difficulties.

## 4. OECD Two-Pillar Solution

### 4.1. Pillar One: Profit Reallocation

Pillar One addresses nexus and profit allocation challenges through two components. Amount A reallocates a portion of residual profits to market jurisdictions regardless of physical presence. Amount B provides simplified transfer pricing for baseline marketing and distribution activities.

Amount A applies to the largest and most profitable multinationals—those with global consolidated revenue exceeding twenty billion euros and profit margins above ten percent. For qualifying enterprises, twenty-five percent of residual profits (profits exceeding the ten percent margin threshold) are reallocated to market jurisdictions where revenue is generated. Nexus is established through market presence and customer revenue rather than physical presence.

The narrow scope of Amount A—estimated to affect fewer than one hundred companies globally—limits its impact on most digital economy participants. Implementation requires a multilateral convention that remains under negotiation, with timelines substantially delayed from original projections.

Amount B, published in February 2024, provides simplified transfer pricing for buy-sell marketing and distribution transactions. A pricing matrix based on return-on-sales methodology establishes arm's length ranges from 1.5 to 5.5 percent depending on industry classification and asset/expense intensity. Jurisdictions may elect to apply Amount B for fiscal years commencing from January 2025. The simplified approach is particularly valuable for developing countries with limited transfer pricing analysis capacity.

### 4.2. Pillar Two: Global Minimum Tax

Pillar Two introduces a fifteen percent global minimum effective tax rate for multinational enterprises with consolidated revenue exceeding 750 million euros. The Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules, published in December 2021, operate through interconnected mechanisms ensuring minimum taxation regardless of where profits are booked.

The Income Inclusion Rule requires parent jurisdictions to impose top-up tax on subsidiary income where the subsidiary's effective tax rate falls below fifteen percent. This ensures minimum taxation through home country supplemental tax, applying regardless of whether the parent jurisdiction uses exemption or credit methods for foreign income.

The Undertaxed Profits Rule provides a backstop mechanism denying deductions or requiring equivalent adjustments where the IIR does not collect top-up tax. This prevents base erosion to low-tax jurisdictions that would otherwise escape minimum taxation.

The Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax allows source jurisdictions to collect top-up tax themselves rather than ceding it to parent jurisdictions applying the IIR. This addresses developing country concerns about revenue allocation, ensuring that jurisdictions hosting low-taxed activity can capture the supplemental tax.

The Subject to Tax Rule, implemented through a dedicated multilateral instrument signed in September 2024, allows developing countries to impose additional withholding on cross-border payments to related parties in low-tax jurisdictions. Targeting a nine percent minimum effective tax rate, the STTR applies to interest, royalties, and service fees. Inclusive Framework members applying nominal tax rates below nine percent have committed to incorporating the STTR into bilateral agreements with developing countries when requested, ensuring source-country protection against base erosion through low-taxed cross-border payments.

The GloBE rules represent a fundamental departure from traditional international tax principles, which historically left rate-setting entirely to sovereign discretion. By introducing coordinated minimum taxation, Pillar Two creates de facto constraints on tax competition. Low-tax jurisdictions can no longer attract investment through low rates alone, as top-up taxes will apply regardless of where income is booked. This transformation of international tax architecture has proceeded remarkably quickly, with major economies implementing legislation within three years of the framework's publication.

## 5. UN Model Provisions

### 5.1. Article 12A: Fees for Technical Services

Article 12A, added to the UN Model in 2017, addresses technical service payments that escape taxation under OECD Model rules requiring permanent establishment. The provision permits source-country taxation of fees for managerial, technical, and consultancy services regardless of physical presence, using gross-basis withholding at bilaterally negotiated rates.

The provision eliminates the permanent establishment barrier for service fees, allowing market jurisdictions to tax payments for services consumed within their territory. Over forty bilateral treaties now incorporate Article 12A provisions, predominantly involving developing countries seeking to protect their tax base from service payment erosion.

### 5.2. Article 12B: Automated Digital Services

Article 12B, added in April 2021, specifically addresses digital economy challenges by permitting source taxation of income from automated digital services—services provided on the internet or electronic networks requiring minimal human involvement. Covered activities include online advertising, digital marketplaces, social media platforms, cloud computing, standardised online teaching, search engines, and user data sales.

The provision offers two taxation approaches. Gross-basis withholding applies at bilaterally negotiated rates, typically three to four percent. Alternatively, a net-basis approach treats thirty percent of gross payments as deemed income subject to standard corporate rates.

Unlike OECD Pillar One's Amount A, Article 12B applies to all digital service providers regardless of size—no revenue or profitability thresholds limit its scope. This makes it potentially applicable to a far broader range of enterprises than Pillar One.

Despite five years since adoption into the UN Model, zero bilateral treaties have incorporated Article 12B provisions as of late 2025. Developed countries, particularly the United States, resist inclusion in bilateral negotiations, preferring the narrower OECD approach. The "minimal human involvement" test creates classification ambiguity that may discourage adoption (covered in June 2024).

### 5.3. The 2025 UN Model Update

The March 2025 UN Model update introduced Article 12AA, consolidating service fee taxation by dramatically expanding scope to cover "any service" rather than Article 12A's limited categories. This provision, replacing the former Article 14 on independent personal services, provides even broader source-country taxing rights. Article 12B remains as a distinct provision for automated digital services.

## 6. Unilateral Measures

### 6.1. Digital Services Taxes

Frustrated by slow progress on multilateral solutions, numerous countries implemented unilateral digital services taxes targeting gross revenue from specified digital activities. France led European adoption with a three percent DST on digital advertising and intermediation services. The United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Greece implemented similar measures at rates ranging from two to seven percent.

Canada enacted its DST in 2024 with retrospective effect from January 2022, applying three percent to online advertising and digital marketplace intermediation services. These unilateral measures create compliance complexity for digital enterprises operating across multiple jurisdictions, each with different thresholds, covered activities, and rates.

### 6.2. Equalization Levies

India pioneered equalization levies as digital economy taxes structured outside the income tax system to avoid treaty coverage. The six percent levy on digital advertising (subsequently abolished April 2025) and two percent levy on e-commerce transactions (abolished August 2024) represented significant revenue sources but created juridical double taxation—the levies applied without treaty relief or foreign tax credit mechanisms (covered in December 2023).

India's withdrawal of these levies reflects alignment with the Two-Pillar framework and recognition of compliance burdens, though it also follows expiration of the standstill agreement under which countries agreed not to impose new DSTs pending Pillar One implementation.

### 6.3. The Standstill Agreement

In July 2023, 138 countries agreed not to impose new digital services taxes through December 2024, pending finalisation of the Pillar One multilateral convention. The agreement represented a diplomatic achievement, temporarily halting proliferation of unilateral measures creating compliance complexity and trade tensions.

The standstill expired without Pillar One implementation, and countries have resumed unilateral measures. This fragmentation of digital economy taxation represents a significant failure of the multilateral process to deliver timely, coordinated reform.

## 7. Implementation Status

### 7.1. Pillar Two Progress

Pillar Two implementation has proceeded despite US non-participation. The European Union required member states to implement GloBE rules through Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive amendments by January 2024. Major economies including the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea enacted legislation during 2024, making Pillar Two operational for fiscal years beginning from that date.

Over 106 Inclusive Framework jurisdictions have implemented interest limitation rules consistent with BEPS recommendations, representing a fifty-eight percent increase from sixty-seven jurisdictions in 2019. This widespread adoption demonstrates that coordinated minimum taxation can proceed without universal participation.

The consolidated GloBE Commentary, updated in 2024, incorporates agreed administrative guidance from March 2022 through December 2023. Four sets of guidance address practical implementation issues including safe harbours for transition periods, treatment of qualified refundable tax credits, and coordination with existing controlled foreign company regimes. This guidance provides essential clarity for multinational enterprises navigating the new rules.

### 7.2. Pillar One Delays

Pillar One implementation has stalled. The multilateral convention text remains under negotiation, with original implementation timelines substantially delayed. Amount A's narrow scope—affecting fewer than one hundred companies—limits its significance even if implemented. The US withdrawal in January 2025 significantly reduced political momentum for completing negotiations.

Amount B represents the most tangible Pillar One achievement, with jurisdictions able to elect application from January 2025. The simplified transfer pricing approach provides immediate benefits for developing countries, even as Amount A negotiations continue.

## 8. Recent Developments

### 8.1. US Withdrawal from Inclusive Framework

The United States withdrew from the OECD Inclusive Framework in January 2025, representing the first major developed economy departure from the multilateral tax framework. This withdrawal effectively stalled Amount A implementation and introduced uncertainty regarding future coordination (covered in June 2023).

The US maintains its traditional Limitation on Benefits approach in bilateral treaties, as demonstrated by the US-Chile treaty concluded in 2024—the first new US treaty in over fifteen years. US treaty policy continues emphasising detailed LOB provisions rather than the Principal Purpose Test adopted by virtually all other jurisdictions through the MLI.

US non-participation does not prevent other jurisdictions from implementing Pillar Two. The GloBE rules operate regardless of US adoption, though US multinationals face top-up taxation by other jurisdictions where their subsidiaries operate. This creates potential for US enterprises to bear minimum tax burdens imposed by foreign jurisdictions rather than the US itself.

### 8.2. UN Framework Convention

The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, established through General Assembly Resolution 79/235 in December 2024, represents an alternative multilateral forum potentially more responsive to developing country interests. Intergovernmental negotiations began in 2025, with scheduled completion by autumn 2027.

The initiative addresses concerns that OECD-led processes inadequately represent developing country perspectives. Early protocols are expected to address taxation of cross-border services in the digital economy—directly relevant to UN Model Articles 12A and 12B. Whether this initiative complements or competes with OECD work remains to be determined as negotiations progress.

### 8.3. Continued Fragmentation

The failure to achieve timely, comprehensive multilateral reform has resulted in continued fragmentation of digital economy taxation. Countries maintain or introduce unilateral DSTs. UN Model provisions (Articles 12A, 12B, 12AA) offer alternatives to OECD approaches. Regional groupings pursue independent initiatives. This fragmentation creates compliance complexity for multinational enterprises and uncertainty regarding the future international tax architecture.

The digital economy remains imperfectly integrated into international tax rules nearly a decade after Action 1 identified fundamental challenges. Whether the Two-Pillar Solution, UN Framework Convention, or unilateral measures ultimately prevail will shape international taxation for decades to come.
