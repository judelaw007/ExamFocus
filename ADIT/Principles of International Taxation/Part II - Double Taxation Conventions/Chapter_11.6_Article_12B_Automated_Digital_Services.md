# Chapter 11.6: Income from Automated Digital Services – Article 12B, UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Policy Rationale

### 1.1. The Role of Article 12B

Article 12B represents one of the most innovative provisions in the UN Model Double Taxation Convention, addressing the taxation of income from automated digital services delivered across borders without physical presence in the market jurisdiction. Added to the UN Model on 20 April 2021, Article 12B grants source countries the right to impose withholding tax on payments for automated digital services—income that under the OECD Model would be treated as business profits taxable only through the permanent establishment mechanism under Article 7.

Like Article 12A on fees for technical services, Article 12B exists only in the UN Model and has no equivalent in the OECD Model Tax Convention. This reflects the UN Model's orientation toward protecting developing country tax bases, recognising that digital business models can generate substantial revenue from source country markets without establishing any taxable presence under traditional permanent establishment concepts.

### 1.2. Policy Rationale for Source Taxation

The policy rationale for Article 12B centres on the inadequacy of traditional permanent establishment concepts for the digital economy. Automated digital services—online advertising, streaming platforms, social media, cloud computing, and digital content delivery—can generate significant revenue from users in a country without requiring any physical infrastructure within that jurisdiction. Under OECD Model principles, such income would be taxable only in the residence country of the service provider.

Developing countries have expressed concern that the digital economy exacerbates existing imbalances in international tax allocation. Major technology companies, predominantly headquartered in developed countries, earn substantial profits from providing automated digital services to developing country markets. The Commentary to Article 12B emphasises that the provision addresses situations where income arises from activities generating revenue in the source country regardless of where services are performed or technology is hosted (covered in December 2024).

### 1.3. Historical Development

Article 12B emerged from discussions within the UN Tax Committee regarding digital economy taxation challenges. While the OECD focused on developing Pillar One to address profit allocation for large multinational enterprises, developing countries at the UN pursued a simpler approach through withholding taxes on digital service payments. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital adoption globally, strengthening the case for source taxation. Article 12B was formally adopted on 20 April 2021, representing a compromise between those seeking broad source taxation and those concerned about administrative complexity.

## 2. Treaty Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 12B(1): Source State Taxing Right

Article 12B(1) provides that income from automated digital services arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. This establishes the residence state's primary taxing right while using permissive language that does not preclude source taxation.

Income arises in the source state where the payer is a resident, following the same source rule approach applied to royalties under Article 12 and fees for technical services under Article 12A. This payment-based source rule differs fundamentally from Article 7, which locates business profits based on permanent establishment activities.

### 2.2. Article 12B(2): Taxation Mechanisms

Article 12B(2) provides that such income may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises. However, if the beneficial owner is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax shall not exceed either a percentage of the gross amount or a percentage of the net amount determined in a specified manner. Unlike Articles 10 and 11 which specify particular withholding rate caps, Article 12B deliberately leaves the rate blank for bilateral negotiation.

The provision offers two alternative mechanisms. Under the gross basis approach, tax is imposed as a percentage of total payment without deduction for expenses. Under the net basis approach, tax is imposed on a deemed profit margin, with the Commentary suggesting thirty percent of gross receipts as deemed taxable income.

### 2.3. Article 12B(3): Definition

Article 12B(3) defines income from automated digital services as any payment in consideration for any service provided on the internet or an electronic network requiring minimal human involvement from the service provider. The definition encompasses both business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions, representing a significant departure from Article 12A which excludes services for personal use (covered in June 2024).

## 3. Definition of Automated Digital Services

### 3.1. The "Minimal Human Involvement" Test

The defining characteristic of automated digital services is that they require "minimal human involvement" from the service provider. This distinguishes Article 12B services from Article 12A technical services, which involve significant human expertise. The test focuses on service delivery rather than overall business operation—significant human involvement in developing the underlying platform does not preclude services from qualifying as automated.

The Commentary provides that automated services are delivered through standardised processes without meaningful customisation or human intervention for individual transactions. Online advertising, streaming content delivery, cloud storage, and standardised software-as-a-service offerings typically meet this requirement. Custom software development or personalised advisory services would fall under Article 12A or Article 7.

### 3.2. Categories of Covered Services

Article 12B(4) provides an indicative list of services that may fall within the definition. Online advertising services include payments for displaying advertisements or making advertising space available on digital platforms. Advertisers targeting users in the source country generate income that arises in that jurisdiction regardless of where the advertising platform is located or where the platform company is resident.

Online intermediation platform services cover digital marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers, including e-commerce platforms, ride-sharing services, accommodation booking platforms, and similar intermediation services. The platform operator receives payments from participants that constitute income from automated digital services, distinct from the underlying goods or services being transacted.

Social media platforms generate income through multiple automated channels including advertising revenue, data monetisation, and premium subscription fees. Digital content services include streaming platforms providing on-demand access to films, music, games, and other digital media. Cloud computing services encompass infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, and storage services provided through remote servers without significant customisation for individual users.

Online gaming services include both subscription-based game access and in-game purchases for virtual goods or enhanced functionality. Standardised online teaching services involve pre-recorded or automated educational content delivery rather than live personalised instruction, which would fall under Article 12A.

The sale of user data represents a distinctive and significant category recognising that personal information collected from source country users has substantial commercial value. This explicit inclusion addresses business models where user data monetisation constitutes a primary revenue source, ensuring that income from data harvesting activities is subject to source taxation even where no direct payment is made by the user whose data is collected.

### 3.3. Exclusions

Article 12B explicitly excludes certain payments. Customised professional services requiring significant human expertise fall under Article 12A or Article 7. Payments constituting royalties under Article 12 are excluded to prevent overlap. Payments ancillary to the sale of goods are excluded, preventing Article 12B from capturing e-commerce transactions where platforms facilitate traditional sales.

Financial services, insurance services, and telecommunications services providing basic connectivity infrastructure are typically excluded given their distinct regulatory frameworks.

## 4. Comparison with OECD Model and Related UN Provisions

### 4.1. Fundamental Difference from OECD Approach

The OECD Model contains no equivalent to Article 12B. Under OECD principles, income from automated digital services constitutes business profits governed by Article 7, taxable in the source country only if the provider maintains a permanent establishment there (covered in December 2023).

This difference reflects the philosophical divide between the models. The OECD's response focused on Pillar One's Amount A, creating new taxing rights for market jurisdictions over residual profits of very large enterprises exceeding specific revenue thresholds—requiring complex profit allocation and applying only to the largest companies.

Article 12B offers a simpler alternative accessible to all countries. Withholding tax on gross payments requires minimal information about service provider profitability. The trade-off involves accepting rough justice through gross basis taxation rather than precise profit allocation.

### 4.2. Distinction from Article 12A (Technical Services)

Article 12A covers fees for technical, managerial, and consultancy services—payments requiring significant human expertise. Article 12B covers automated digital services requiring minimal human involvement. The human involvement threshold provides the primary distinguishing criterion.

A notable distinction involves personal use services. Article 12A excludes payments for services rendered for personal use. Article 12B includes consumer-facing services, recognising that automated digital platforms generate substantial revenue from individual users. This asymmetry reflects the particular characteristics of digital business models.

### 4.3. Relationship with Article 12AA (2025 Update)

The 2025 UN Model update introduced Article 12AA on services, replacing former Article 12A and Article 14 with a consolidated provision covering all service payments. Article 12AA applies to "fees for services" defined as any payment in consideration for any service, dramatically broadening source taxation scope.

Article 12B remains a distinct provision focused on automated digital services. Where services qualify under both provisions, the more specific Article 12B typically governs. Countries negotiating treaties incorporating the 2025 updates will need to address the interaction between these provisions explicitly.

## 5. Taxation Mechanisms

### 5.1. Gross Basis Taxation

The gross basis mechanism imposes withholding tax as a percentage of total payments without allowing deduction for expenses incurred in providing the services. This approach offers administrative simplicity—the payer withholds a specified percentage and remits it to tax authorities without requiring detailed information about the service provider's cost structure or profit margins.

The UN Commentary suggests a rate range of three to four percent for gross basis taxation, significantly lower than typical rates for dividends (five to fifteen percent), interest (ten percent under OECD), or royalties (ten percent or more under UN Model). This lower rate acknowledges that gross basis taxation on high-volume, low-margin digital services could otherwise result in tax burdens exceeding actual profits.

Digital platforms often operate with thin margins on individual transactions while generating aggregate profits through scale and network effects. A fifteen percent withholding rate appropriate for royalty payments could effectively confiscate the entire profit margin on digital service transactions. The three to four percent range attempts to balance source country revenue objectives with commercial viability for service providers.

### 5.2. Net Basis Alternative

The net basis alternative permits tax on a deemed profit percentage of gross receipts. The Commentary suggests thirty percent of gross receipts as deemed taxable income, which would then be subject to the source country's standard corporate tax rate. A country with thirty percent corporate tax rate would effectively impose nine percent on gross payments.

### 5.3. Rate Negotiation

Article 12B intentionally leaves rates unspecified for bilateral negotiation, allowing countries to calibrate source taxation according to their policy priorities and bargaining positions. The absence of specified rates creates risk of inconsistency across treaty networks, potentially creating compliance complexity for global service providers.

## 6. Implementation Challenges

### 6.1. Zero Treaty Adoption to Date

As of late 2025, no bilateral tax treaty has incorporated Article 12B provisions. Despite UN Model adoption in April 2021, the article remains theoretical rather than operational. This zero adoption rate reflects developed countries' resistance, availability of alternative measures such as digital services taxes, and ongoing development of OECD Pillar One.

Tanzania stands as the only country to have explicitly referenced Article 12B in domestic legislation. However, domestic law implementation differs from treaty incorporation and does not create reduced-rate entitlements. The disconnect between UN Model adoption and treaty practice raises questions about Article 12B's practical significance (covered in June 2023).

### 6.2. Scope and Characterisation Challenges

Defining which services fall within Article 12B's scope presents ongoing challenges. The "minimal human involvement" test provides general guidance but leaves substantial interpretive discretion. Technology evolves rapidly, creating new service categories that may not fit neatly within existing definitions. Artificial intelligence services increasingly blur the line between automated delivery and human-like customisation—a sophisticated AI chatbot may provide service experiences comparable to human representatives while technically requiring minimal human involvement per transaction.

Service bundling creates additional complexity. Digital platforms often provide combinations of automated and human-delivered services within single subscriptions or relationships. Unbundling payments to determine which portions fall under Article 12B, Article 12A, Article 12 royalties, or Article 7 business profits requires detailed analysis that may not align with commercial pricing structures or contractual arrangements.

Cross-border characterisation disputes are likely as different countries apply Article 12B criteria differently. A service characterised as automated in one jurisdiction might be viewed as requiring significant human involvement in another. Without binding dispute resolution mechanisms specifically addressing Article 12B characterisation, such differences could persist across treaty networks, creating uncertainty for both taxpayers and tax administrations.

## 7. Relationship with Other Digital Economy Measures

### 7.1. BEPS Pillar One

OECD Pillar One represents an alternative approach to allocating taxing rights over digital economy profits. Amount A would create new taxing rights for market jurisdictions over residual profits of enterprises exceeding twenty billion euros annual revenue and ten percent profitability.

Article 12B and Pillar One reflect fundamentally different philosophies. Article 12B applies broadly through withholding on gross payments. Pillar One applies narrowly through complex profit allocation formulas. The January 2025 withdrawal of the United States from the OECD Inclusive Framework effectively stalled Pillar One implementation, potentially increasing interest in Article 12B alternatives.

### 7.2. Digital Services Taxes

Many countries have implemented unilateral digital services taxes as interim measures. These taxes typically apply to revenues from specified digital activities including online advertising and digital intermediation at rates of two to seven percent. Digital services taxes operate as domestic law measures rather than treaty provisions, applying regardless of treaty networks without bilateral allocation mechanisms.

Article 12B, if incorporated into treaties, would provide a more structured framework than unilateral taxes, establishing agreed allocation and requiring double taxation relief mechanisms.

## 8. Key States' Approaches

### 8.1. Developing Country Perspectives

Developing countries have consistently supported source taxation over digital services, viewing Article 12B as a valuable negotiating template even where actual treaty incorporation has not yet been achieved. The G-24 group of developing countries has advocated for robust source taxation provisions and expressed concern that OECD-led processes do not adequately address developing country priorities.

African, Asian, and South American countries have been particularly active in implementing domestic digital services taxes while Article 12B treaty adoption remains elusive. India's equalisation levy, repealed in stages during 2024-2025, demonstrated developing country willingness to act unilaterally when multilateral approaches stall. Similar measures have been implemented across Latin America and Africa, creating a patchwork of domestic taxation approaches to digital services.

The Platform for Collaboration on Tax, involving the UN, OECD, IMF, and World Bank Group, has provided guidance to developing countries on digital economy taxation options, but has not clearly endorsed Article 12B as the preferred approach.

### 8.2. Developed Country Resistance

Developed countries, particularly the United States, have consistently resisted incorporating Article 12B provisions into their treaty networks. The United States views broad source taxation over service payments as inconsistent with established treaty principles and potentially distortive of cross-border investment and trade in digital services.

The developed country position emphasises that digital services create value through research, development, and platform investment concentrated in residence countries rather than through mere consumption in market jurisdictions. Source taxation without physical presence, they argue, inappropriately allocates income away from where genuine economic activities occur and where investment risks are borne.

This resistance explains why Article 12B remains incorporated in no bilateral treaty despite nearly five years in the UN Model. Developing countries cannot unilaterally incorporate treaty provisions—they require agreement from treaty partners who have thus far declined to accept Article 12B language in negotiations.

## 9. Recent Developments

### 9.1. The 2025 UN Model Update

The March 2025 UN Model update maintained Article 12B while introducing Article 12AA on services. This confirms Article 12B's continued relevance within the UN Model framework. The update also addressed the UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, which envisions comprehensive multilateral approaches to digital economy taxation beyond bilateral provisions.

### 9.2. Future Prospects

Article 12B's future depends significantly on developments in broader digital economy taxation discussions. If OECD Pillar One implementation collapses entirely following US withdrawal from the Inclusive Framework, pressure may increase for alternative approaches including Article 12B. Conversely, any revival of Pillar One negotiations could reduce interest in withholding-based approaches by providing an alternative allocation mechanism.

The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation initiative may provide a vehicle for multilateral adoption of Article 12B principles beyond the challenges of bilateral treaty negotiations. Such an approach could potentially overcome developed country resistance by creating broader multilateral consensus around source taxation for automated digital services, though the prospects for such consensus remain uncertain.

Regional treaty networks among developing countries may offer more immediate opportunities for Article 12B incorporation. South-South treaty negotiations between developing countries that share source taxation interests may be more receptive to Article 12B provisions than North-South negotiations where interests fundamentally diverge.

Regardless of formal treaty adoption, Article 12B serves an important function in articulating and legitimising developing country positions on digital economy taxation. The provision provides a reference point for domestic law developments, regional policy coordination, and ongoing multilateral negotiations. Its influence extends beyond specific treaty provisions to shape the broader international discourse on appropriate allocation of taxing rights in an increasingly digital global economy.
