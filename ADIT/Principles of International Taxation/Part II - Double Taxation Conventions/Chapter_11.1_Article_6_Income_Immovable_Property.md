# Chapter 11.1: Income from Immovable Property – Article 6, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Policy Rationale

### 1.1. The Role of Article 6

Article 6 allocates taxing rights over income from immovable property (real estate). It establishes the fundamental principle that the situs state—the state where the property is located—has the right to tax such income. This reflects the strong economic connection between immovable property and its location, representing one of the most universally accepted principles in international taxation.

The situs state taxation principle rests on several foundations. Immovable property has a direct economic relationship with the state where it is situated, as income derives from use of local resources and land. The state provides infrastructure, legal protection, and services that support property use. From an enforcement perspective, property cannot be moved to avoid taxation, enabling the situs state to effectively enforce tax claims. The benefit principle also supports this allocation, as property owners benefit from local services and infrastructure, making it appropriate that the local state receives corresponding tax revenue.

### 1.2. Historical Development

The situs taxation principle for immovable property predates modern treaty networks. The Mexico Draft of 1943 and London Draft of 1946 gave the situs state exclusive taxing rights. The 1959 OEEC changed this to an "open" rule permitting both states to tax. The 1963 OECD Model Tax Convention adopted the current structure, which has remained essentially unchanged since then.

### 1.3. The "Open" Distributive Rule

Article 6 is an "open" distributive rule, meaning the situs state "may" tax income from immovable property, but the residence state also retains the right to tax the same income. This contrasts with "closed" rules that grant exclusive taxing rights to one state, such as Article 8 for shipping and air transport profits.

The language "may be taxed in that other State" creates shared allocation rather than exclusive jurisdiction. When both states exercise their taxing rights, the residence state must provide double taxation relief through exemption or credit under Article 23. The December 2023 examination noted that Article 6 "leaves open both the residence (Fragonia) and situs state (Geronia) to tax the relevant income."

## 2. Treaty Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 6(1): The Basic Rule

Article 6(1) establishes the fundamental allocation: "Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

This grants the situs state the right to tax income from immovable property, including agricultural and forestry income, while preserving the residence state's concurrent right subject to relief obligations.

### 2.2. Article 6(2): Definition

Article 6(2) defines immovable property using a dual approach: "The term 'immovable property' shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property."

The domestic law of the situs state provides the primary definition, ensuring certainty through application of local law. However, certain items are specifically included regardless of domestic characterisation, and ships, boats, and aircraft are expressly excluded even if domestic law treats them as immovable.

### 2.3. Article 6(3) and (4): Scope

Article 6(3) specifies that the basic rule applies to income from "the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property." This broad formulation covers rental income, owner occupation, and any other exploitation of the property.

Article 6(4) confirms that "the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise." This ensures Article 6 applies regardless of whether the property owner is an individual or business entity, and confirms Article 6's priority over Article 7 for business property.

## 3. Definition of Immovable Property

### 3.1. Primary Definition: Domestic Law

The definition refers first to "the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated." This means the situs state's domestic law determines what constitutes immovable property, providing a clear and administrable rule. The residence state's characterisation is irrelevant for this purpose.

Typical inclusions under most domestic laws encompass land, buildings (residential, commercial, and industrial), fixtures permanently attached to land or buildings, agricultural land and farms, forests and forestry land, and mines, quarries, and mineral deposits.

### 3.2. Specific Inclusions

Regardless of domestic law, Article 6(2) specifies that immovable property "in any case" includes property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights under general law respecting landed property, usufruct of immovable property, and rights to payments for working mineral deposits, sources, and other natural resources. These minimum inclusions ensure consistent treatment across treaties even where domestic definitions vary.

### 3.3. Express Exclusions

Ships, boats, and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property even if domestic law treats them as such. These are covered by separate provisions, particularly Article 8 for shipping and air transport profits and Article 22(3) for capital taxation. This exclusion prevents overlap between Article 6's situs-based rule and Article 8's place of effective management rule.

### 3.4. Boundary Issues

The Royal Bank of Canada v HMRC decision (UK Court of Appeal, 2023) clarified Article 6's scope. The case involved assigned rights to payment claimed to constitute income from immovable property. The court held that such rights did not fall within Article 6 because the payments could not be said to have a "source in the land" or constitute any "interest in land." This establishes that Article 6 requires a direct nexus with immovable property—mere contractual rights connected to land are insufficient.

Similarly, interest on debt secured by immovable property falls under Article 11 rather than Article 6. The security relationship does not transform the interest income into income from immovable property. Shares in property-rich companies may trigger Article 13(4) for capital gains purposes but dividends remain subject to Article 10.

## 4. Types of Income Covered

### 4.1. Three Categories Under Article 6(3)

Article 6(3) covers income from three categories of use. Direct use encompasses situations where the owner occupies and uses property directly, including agricultural use of farmland, owner-operated forestry, and mining or extraction by the owner. Letting covers all rental income from leasing property, including commercial leases, residential tenancies, and short-term rentals. Use in any other form is a catch-all for other exploitation including royalties from mineral extraction rights, payments for timber rights, and any other income from property use.

### 4.2. Agriculture and Forestry

Article 6(1) expressly includes "income from agriculture or forestry" within its scope. This covers crop cultivation, livestock raising, timber harvesting, and forestry management. The rationale is that such income primarily concerns the use of land. Notably, ownership of immovable property exploited for agriculture is not necessary—a tenant farmer's income qualifies under Article 6. Some countries have entered reservations choosing to tax agricultural and forestry income under Article 7 instead.

### 4.3. Ancillary and Incidental Income

Whether income ancillary to the use of immovable property falls within Article 6 is not specifically addressed in the treaty text or Commentary. The December 2023 examination addressed this issue in the context of utilities income charged to tenants in addition to rent. Arguments favour Article 6 treatment where the amount is insignificant relative to rental income and closely connected to the letting. German case law (BFH, 18 September 1996) held that currency gains generated from letting immovable property constituted income from immovable property under Article 6.

The general principle is that income incidental to property use may fall within Article 6, while separate business activities do not. The test requires examining the nexus between the income and the immovable property itself.

## 5. Enterprise Property and Article 6(4)

### 5.1. Purpose and Effect

Article 6(4) confirms that Article 6 applies to income from immovable property held by enterprises, not merely individuals. This has several important consequences. First, it confirms Article 6's priority over Article 7, meaning even if property is a business asset and even if the enterprise has a permanent establishment in the situs state, income from immovable property falls under Article 6 rather than Article 7. Second, the situs state has taxing rights without requiring a permanent establishment—an enterprise can generate Article 6 income in a state without meeting permanent establishment thresholds.

### 5.2. Practical Application

The December 2023 examination (Angelica case) illustrated this principle. Angelica Co. was an enterprise that owned a warehouse in Geronia. Article 6(4) confirmed that Article 6(1) and (3) applied to the rental income, and Geronia had taxing rights under Article 6 regardless of whether Angelica had a permanent establishment there. The distinction between income from use of property (Article 6) and income from business activities conducted using the property (potentially Article 7) required careful analysis.

## 6. Priority and Interaction with Other Articles

### 6.1. Priority Over Articles 7-21

Article 6 takes priority over most other distributive articles, particularly Article 7 (business profits) and Article 21 (other income). Even where an enterprise has a permanent establishment in the situs state, income from immovable property remains governed by Article 6 rather than being absorbed into Article 7 business profits.

Article 21(2) expressly provides that the other income article operates subject to other provisions including Article 6. Only where income lacks the requisite nexus to immovable property does Article 21 potentially apply.

### 6.2. Interaction with Article 7

The key distinction is between income from use of property and income from business activities. Article 6 covers rental income, letting income, and other exploitation of the property itself. Article 7 covers profits from business activities that may happen to use the property. The December 2023 examination noted that "income derived from the sale of products assembled in Geronia may have fallen within Article 7 as business profits rather than being income with the requisite nexus to immovable property."

### 6.3. Parallel Operation with Articles 13 and 22

Article 6 does not take priority over Articles 13 or 22 because these provisions address different types of taxation. Article 6 covers income from use of property during ownership. Article 13 covers gains from alienation (sale or disposal) of property. Article 22 covers taxes on capital or wealth value of property.

These operate in parallel, not in conflict. The December 2023 examination illustrated this clearly: during Years 2-3, rental income fell under Article 6; in Year 4, the sale gain fell under Article 13(1); throughout, annual capital levies on property value fell under Article 22. The situs state had taxing rights under all three articles for different aspects of the same property.

## 7. Relationship with Article 13: Capital Gains

### 7.1. The Delineation

Article 6 covers income from use of immovable property while Article 13(1) covers gains from alienation. The December 2023 examination stated: "The gain has arisen as a result of a sale ('alienation') of the warehouse rather than as a result of income generated from the use of the warehouse."

Both articles follow the same situs state principle—the state where property is located may tax both income during ownership and gains upon disposal. This consistent policy ensures comprehensive situs state taxation of immovable property returns.

### 7.2. Article 13(4) and Indirect Transfers

Article 13(4) extends situs state taxation to gains from alienation of shares deriving their value from immovable property. Under the Multilateral Instrument, gains from alienation of shares or comparable interests may be taxed in the situs state if, at any time during the 365 days preceding alienation, these interests derived more than 50% of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in that state.

This provision addresses offshore indirect transfers where investors sell shares in holding companies rather than the underlying property to avoid situs state taxation. The Platform for Collaboration on Tax has developed toolkits to help developing countries address such transfers, recognising their significance for protecting tax bases.

## 8. Recent Developments

### 8.1. Immovable Property Information Exchange (December 2024)

In December 2024, twenty-five OECD countries signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Readily Available Information on Immovable Property (IPI MCAA). This addresses a gap in international tax transparency—while financial account information is exchanged under the Common Reporting Standard, no mechanism previously existed for exchanging information on non-financial assets.

Participating countries including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and others aim to join by 2029-2030 subject to domestic procedures. This development enhances enforcement of Article 6 taxation by enabling situs states to identify non-resident property owners who may be failing to report rental income.

### 8.2. 2025 OECD Model Updates

The 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention includes enhanced provisions for resource-rich countries, providing flexibility to extend source taxing rights to exploration and support activities, including those conducted onshore in support of offshore projects. A lower permanent establishment threshold applies for relevant activities.

The update also clarifies that for natural resources, the source state may tax gains derived from immovable property and exploration/exploitation rights, movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment used for relevant activities, and shares deriving more than 50% of their value from such property.

### 8.3. Commentary Developments

Recent Commentary updates have incorporated developments in German partnership law following the Partnership Law Modernization Act (MoPeG) effective January 2024, and addressed practical issues arising from cross-border property ownership structures. The Commentary continues to emphasise that taxation should be of profits rather than gross income, with appropriate deductions for expenses incurred.

## 9. UN Model Comparison

### 9.1. Identical Treatment

The UN Model Tax Convention Article 6 is identical to the OECD Model. This unusual convergence reflects the universal acceptance of situs taxation for immovable property income. Both developed and developing countries benefit from this rule depending on where property is located, eliminating the typical source-residence tension that drives OECD-UN differences in other articles.

Both models use the same "open" distributive rule, the same dual definition approach combining domestic law with specific inclusions, the same coverage of income types (direct use, letting, other use), and the same enterprise property provision in paragraph 4. The UN Commentary mirrors OECD guidance on interpretation and application.

### 9.2. Policy Alignment

The identical treatment reflects that immovable property taxation serves both capital-exporting and capital-importing countries' interests. Developed countries whose residents own property in developing countries benefit when their residents own domestic property exploited by foreign investors. Developing countries hosting foreign-owned property benefit from situs taxation rights. This mutual benefit explains the absence of the modified rules and alternative provisions that characterise UN departures in articles governing dividends, interest, royalties, and business profits.

## 10. Commentary Guidance

### 10.1. Key Commentary Provisions

Commentary paragraph 1 confirms that Article 6 applies only where immovable property is situated in the other contracting state, not in a third state or the residence state itself. Commentary paragraph 4 emphasises that an enterprise can generate Article 6 income even without a permanent establishment in the situs state. Commentary paragraph 5 provides that taxation should be of profits rather than gross income, meaning expenses incurred in earning the income should be deductible.

### 10.2. Gross versus Net Taxation

The Commentary's emphasis on net rather than gross taxation is significant for cross-border property investors. Situs states should permit deductions for maintenance costs, insurance, property taxes where deductible under domestic law, interest on acquisition financing subject to applicable limitations, and depreciation. This ensures that foreign property owners are not disadvantaged compared to domestic owners through denial of ordinary business deductions.

## 11. Practical Application

### 11.1. Application Framework

Applying Article 6 requires a structured analysis. First, determine whether immovable property exists by checking the situs state's domestic law and Article 6(2)'s specific inclusions and exclusions. Second, confirm the property is situated in the other contracting state rather than a third state or the residence state. Third, identify whether income arises from the property through direct use, letting, or other form of use. Fourth, assess whether the income has sufficient nexus with the immovable property applying the Royal Bank of Canada test. Fifth, apply the distributive rule recognising that both situs and residence states may tax, with the residence state providing relief.

### 11.2. Interaction Analysis

Consider interaction with other articles. Article 6 takes priority over Article 7 for income from property use. Article 6 takes priority over Article 21 for income from immovable property. Article 13 applies separately to gains from alienation. Article 22 applies separately to capital or wealth taxes on property value.

Understanding these relationships is essential for examination purposes, as the December 2023 question required applying multiple articles to different income streams and taxes arising from the same property across several tax years.
