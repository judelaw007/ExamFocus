## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE ROLE OF ARTICLE 9

### 1.1 Purpose and Function

Article 9 addresses the allocation of profits between **associated enterprises** - related parties in different tax jurisdictions. It provides the treaty framework for:

- **Establishing the arm's length principle** in treaty law
- **Authorising tax authorities** to adjust profits between related parties
- **Requiring corresponding adjustments** to eliminate double taxation
- **Linking domestic transfer pricing rules** to international standards

Article 9 is often called the "constitutional provision" for transfer pricing in treaty law.

### 1.2 Status of Article 9

**EXAM TIP - Understanding Article 9's Status:**

Article 9 is **NOT** a comprehensive transfer pricing code. It is:

```
WHAT ARTICLE 9 DOES AND DOES NOT DO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ARTICLE 9 DOES:
✓ Establish the arm's length principle as the standard
✓ Authorise Contracting States to adjust profits
✓ Require corresponding adjustments (paragraph 2)
✓ Provide framework for MAP on transfer pricing disputes

ARTICLE 9 DOES NOT:
✗ Provide detailed methodology for pricing transactions
✗ Specify which transfer pricing methods to use
✗ Operate without domestic legislation
✗ Self-execute adjustments automatically

KEY INSIGHT:
Article 9 is an ENABLING provision that works IN CONJUNCTION with
domestic transfer pricing legislation. It does not create taxing
rights - it allocates existing rights between associated enterprises.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 1.3 Link to Transfer Pricing Legislation

Article 9 provides the **treaty basis** for domestic transfer pricing rules. The relationship is:

1. **Domestic law** creates the primary obligation to price at arm's length
2. **Article 9** confirms this approach is consistent with treaty obligations
3. **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines** provide detailed methodology
4. **Article 9(2)** ensures relief from double taxation through corresponding adjustments

**June 2023 Q3 stated:**
> "Article 9 OECD MTC 2017 works in conjunction with Article 7 in relation to business profits of associated enterprises. Article 9 relies upon the arm's length principle..."

---

## 2. ARTICLE 9 TEXT AND STRUCTURE (OECD MTC 2017)

### 2.1 Full Text

**Article 9(1):**
> "Where
> a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
> b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,
>
> and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly."

**Article 9(2):**
> "Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other."

### 2.2 Structure Overview

| Paragraph | Content | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **9(1)(a)** | Parent-subsidiary relationship | Defines vertical association |
| **9(1)(b)** | Common control | Defines horizontal association |
| **9(1) main** | Arm's length principle | Authorises profit adjustment |
| **9(2)** | Corresponding adjustment | Eliminates double taxation |

---

## 3. ARTICLE 9(1): THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE

### 3.1 Associated Enterprises Defined

Article 9(1) applies when enterprises are "associated" through:

```
ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES - ARTICLE 9(1)(a) and (b)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ARTICLE 9(1)(a) - VERTICAL ASSOCIATION
"An enterprise of [State A] participates directly or indirectly
in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of [State B]"

Examples:
• Parent company owns subsidiary (capital participation)
• Head office controls branch decisions (management)
• Holding company directs group strategy (control)

      State A                    State B
    ┌─────────┐               ┌─────────┐
    │  Parent │──────────────→│  Sub    │
    │   Co    │  Owns/Controls│  Co     │
    └─────────┘               └─────────┘

ARTICLE 9(1)(b) - HORIZONTAL ASSOCIATION
"The same persons participate...in the management, control or
capital of [both enterprises]"

Examples:
• Sister companies under common parent
• Companies with same individual shareholder
• Enterprises under common management

      ┌──────────────────┐
      │  Common Owner/   │
      │   Controller     │
      └────────┬─────────┘
               │
       ┌───────┴────────┐
       ↓                ↓
   State A           State B
  ┌────────┐        ┌────────┐
  │ Co A   │        │ Co B   │
  └────────┘        └────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.2 The Arm's Length Standard

The arm's length principle requires transactions between associated enterprises to be priced as if they were between **independent parties dealing at arm's length**.

**The Key Language:**
> "conditions...which differ from those which would be made between **independent enterprises**"

```
THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCEPT:
Compare ACTUAL conditions between associated enterprises with
HYPOTHETICAL conditions between independent enterprises

ACTUAL TRANSACTION:            vs    ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION:
┌──────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Related Party A sells    │        │ Independent party sells  │
│ to Related Party B       │        │ to independent party     │
│ at £100 per unit         │        │ at £150 per unit        │
└──────────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────────┘
           │                                    │
           └────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                        ↓
              TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENT

              Party A's profit increased by £50/unit
              to reflect arm's length price

WHY THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE?
• Separate entity approach - Treats group members as independent
• Neutrality - Same rules for MNEs and independent enterprises
• Prevents profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions
• International consensus standard (OECD, UN, domestic laws)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.3 "May Be Included" - Authorisation Not Obligation

The phrase "may be included in the profits of that enterprise" is important:

- Article 9(1) **authorises** adjustments - it does not mandate them
- The Contracting State has **discretion** to make adjustments
- Actual adjustments require **domestic legislation** to implement
- Article 9 provides treaty **cover** for domestic TP rules

**EXAM POINT:** Article 9 does not itself create an adjustment mechanism. It confirms that adjustments made under domestic transfer pricing law are consistent with treaty obligations.

### 3.4 Relationship with OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines

The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines provide detailed guidance on applying the arm's length principle. While not part of the treaty text, the Guidelines are:

- **Interpretive guidance** for Article 9
- Referenced in the Commentary to Article 9
- Widely adopted by OECD and non-OECD countries
- Updated regularly (most recent: January 2022)

## 4. ARTICLE 9(2): CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENTS

### 4.1 Purpose

Article 9(2) addresses the **double taxation** that can arise from transfer pricing adjustments:

- State A increases Enterprise A's profits by adjustment
- The same profits were already taxed in State B (Enterprise B's hands)
- Without relief: Double taxation of the same profits
- Article 9(2): Requires State B to make "corresponding adjustment"

### 4.2 The Mechanism

```
CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENTS UNDER ARTICLE 9(2)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO:
Parent Co (State A) sells goods to Sub Co (State B) at £100
State A determines arm's length price is £150

STEP 1: PRIMARY ADJUSTMENT (State A)
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ State A increases Parent Co's income by £50                    │
│ Parent Co taxed on additional £50 profit                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 2: WITHOUT CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ State A taxes: Original profit + £50 adjustment = £X + £50    │
│ State B taxes: Original profit (includes £50 already)         │
│                                                                │
│ RESULT: £50 is taxed TWICE (economic double taxation)         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 3: WITH CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT (Article 9(2))
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ State A taxes: £X + £50 adjustment                            │
│ State B: Reduces Sub Co's taxable income by £50               │
│          OR provides tax relief on £50                        │
│                                                                │
│ RESULT: Double taxation eliminated                             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.3 Conditions for Corresponding Adjustment

The obligation to make a corresponding adjustment requires:

1. **State A has made a primary adjustment** - Included profits in Enterprise A
2. **Profits were already taxed in State B** - Enterprise B charged to tax
3. **The adjustment is arm's length** - Reflects what independent enterprises would have done
4. **Due regard to other provisions** - Consistent with treaty overall

### 4.4 "Shall Make an Appropriate Adjustment"

The language "shall make" creates an **obligation** on the other Contracting State. However:

**Limitations:**
- State B only obligated if it **agrees** the primary adjustment is appropriate
- If State B disagrees, competent authorities must consult (Article 25 MAP)
- Adjustment must be "appropriate" - not necessarily £-for-£
- State B may refuse if primary adjustment exceeds arm's length

**EXAM POINT:** Article 9(2) is not a guaranteed relief mechanism. Corresponding adjustments depend on:
- State B agreeing with State A's primary adjustment
- States resolving disputes through MAP if they disagree
- Domestic law permitting the adjustment

### 4.5 Competent Authority Consultation

Article 9(2) explicitly references competent authority consultation:
> "the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other"

This links Article 9 to the **Mutual Agreement Procedure** (Article 25), which provides the dispute resolution mechanism for transfer pricing cases.

---

## 5. UN MODEL DIFFERENCES

### 5.1 Overview

The UN Model includes Article 9(1) and 9(2) substantially similar to the OECD Model. However, the UN Model adds:

- **Article 9(3)** - Time limit provision (not in OECD Model)
- Different **Commentary** emphasising developing country concerns
- Recognition of **administrative challenges** in applying the arm's length principle

### 5.2 UN Article 9(3) - Time Limit

**UN Model Article 9(3):**
> "The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply where judicial, administrative or other legal proceedings have resulted in a final ruling that by actions giving rise to an adjustment of profits under paragraph 1, one of the enterprises concerned is liable to penalty with respect to fraud, gross negligence or wilful default."

This provision:
- Denies corresponding adjustments in **fraud cases**
- Applies where there has been a **final ruling** of wrongdoing
- Reflects concern about protecting developing countries from abusive transactions

```
UN ARTICLE 9(3) - FRAUD EXCEPTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OCED MODEL                       UN MODEL
────────────────────────────     ────────────────────────────────
No paragraph 9(3)                Article 9(3) adds exception:

Corresponding adjustment         Corresponding adjustment
required in all cases            NOT required where:
where primary adjustment         • Final ruling of fraud
is arm's length                  • Gross negligence
                                 • Wilful default

RATIONALE FOR UN APPROACH:
• Taxpayer who defrauded one state should not benefit from relief
• Developing countries concerned about aggressive avoidance
• Corresponds to domestic anti-fraud provisions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5.3 UN Commentary Differences

The UN Commentary to Article 9 emphasises:

1. **Capacity concerns** - Developing countries may lack resources for complex TP analysis
2. **Fixed margins** - Alternative approaches like fixed profit margins
3. **Simplified methods** - Safe harbours for smaller transactions
4. **Balance** - Between source country taxation and avoiding double taxation

---

## 6. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER ARTICLES

### 6.1 Article 9 and Article 7

Article 9 and Article 7 both deal with profit allocation, but to different situations:

```
ARTICLE 9 vs ARTICLE 7 - COMPARISON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ARTICLE 9:                        ARTICLE 7:
Associated Enterprises            Business Profits (PE)
────────────────────────────      ────────────────────────────
• Two SEPARATE legal entities    • ONE legal entity
• Parent ↔ Subsidiary            • Head office ↔ PE
• Inter-company transactions     • Internal "dealings"
• Legally enforceable contracts  • No legal effect transactions
• Transfer pricing adjustments   • Profit attribution (AOA)

COMMON PRINCIPLE:
Both apply the ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE

Article 9: "conditions...which would be made between
           independent enterprises"

Article 7: "profits it might be expected to make...if it were
           a separate and independent enterprise"

EXAM CONNECTION (June 2023):
"Article 9 OECD MTC 2017 works in conjunction with Article 7
in relation to business profits of associated enterprises.
Article 9 relies upon the arm's length principle (ALP)..."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 6.2 Article 9 and Articles 10, 11, 12

Article 9 can interact with the specific income articles:

**Article 10 (Dividends):**
- Article 9 can apply to excessive management charges that should be dividends
- "Hidden dividends" may be recharacterised

**Article 11 (Interest):**
- Thin capitalisation rules may apply under domestic law with Article 9 cover
- Excessive interest may be recharacterised (June 2022 exam reference)
- Interest rate must be arm's length

**Article 12 (Royalties):**
- Royalty rates must reflect arm's length
- Excessive royalties may be recharacterised as dividends

```
ARTICLE 9 INTERACTION WITH ARTICLES 10, 11, 12
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Parent Co (State A) lends to Sub Co (State B)
          Interest rate: 15% (market rate: 5%)

STEP 1: Identify non-arm's length condition
        Interest at 15% exceeds independent enterprise rate

STEP 2: Article 9 primary adjustment (State A view)
        Only 5% is true interest
        Remaining 10% is deemed dividend distribution

STEP 3: Apply correct article
        5% → Article 11 (Interest) - Limited WHT
        10% → Article 10 (Dividends) - Different WHT rate

STEP 4: Corresponding adjustment (State B)
        State B may allow Sub Co deduction only for 5%
        (Or may need MAP consultation)

EXAM POINT (June 2022):
Article 9 and Article 11 interaction was specifically examined -
application of arm's length to interest payments

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 6.3 Priority and Sequencing

Article 9 is not a "distributive article" in the traditional sense. It operates as a **corrective provision**:

1. First, identify the nature of the payment (interest, royalty, service fee, etc.)
2. Apply the relevant distributive article (10, 11, 12, 7, etc.)
3. If conditions differ from arm's length, Article 9 authorises adjustment
4. Re-apply distributive article to adjusted amount

---

## 7. ARTICLE 9 AND THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE VS GLOBAL FORMULARY APPORTIONMENT

### 7.1 Exam Context

The June 2023 exam (Q3, 25 marks) tested the comparison between:
- **Arm's Length Principle (ALP)** - Transaction-by-transaction basis
- **Global Formulary Apportionment (GFA)** - Apportionment by formula

This is a Level 3 topic requiring detailed understanding.

### 7.2 The Two Approaches

```
ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE (ALP) vs GLOBAL FORMULARY APPORTIONMENT (GFA)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE (ALP):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
APPROACH:
• Transaction-by-transaction analysis
• Compare to comparable uncontrolled transactions
• Apply one of five OECD methods
• Separate entity approach

ARTICLE 9 BASIS:
"conditions...which would be made between independent enterprises"

ADVANTAGES:
✓ Respects legal structure of MNE
✓ Transaction-specific accuracy
✓ Flexible - adapts to facts
✓ International consensus (OECD, UN)

DISADVANTAGES:
✗ Complex and costly to apply
✗ Comparable data may not exist
✗ Can produce range of outcomes
✗ Disputes between tax authorities

GLOBAL FORMULARY APPORTIONMENT (GFA):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
APPROACH:
• Combine worldwide profits of MNE group
• Apportion to each jurisdiction by formula
• Formula typically based on: Sales, Assets, Payroll
• Unitary business approach

NO ARTICLE 9 BASIS - Would require different treaty provision

ADVANTAGES:
✓ Simpler to administer
✓ Less susceptible to manipulation
✓ No need for comparables
✓ More certainty

DISADVANTAGES:
✗ Arbitrary allocation (formula choice)
✗ Ignores actual profit drivers
✗ No international consensus
✗ Different formulas → Double taxation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 7.3 OECD Position

The OECD Commentary to Article 9 firmly endorses the ALP and rejects GFA:

> "The arm's length principle has been chosen by OECD Member countries as the appropriate standard... The arm's length principle treats members of an MNE group as operating as separate entities rather than as inseparable parts of a single unified business."

**Reasons for OECD preference:**
1. Theoretical soundness - Respects separate legal personality
2. Practical experience - Decades of application
3. International consensus - Avoids conflicting formulas
4. Flexibility - Adapts to different industries and transactions

### 7.4 Pillar One Amount A

Note: OECD/G20 Pillar One introduces a **formulaic element** (Amount A) for certain large MNEs, representing a limited departure from pure ALP. This is beyond the scope of this chapter but may be tested in transfer pricing sections.

---

## 8. EXAM APPLICATION

### 8.1 How Article 9 Appears in Exams

Article 9 typically appears:
1. **Linked to transfer pricing questions** - TP adjustments under treaty
2. **In Article 9/11 interaction** - Interest payments between related parties
3. **In ALP vs GFA comparison** - As in June 2023
4. **In corresponding adjustment scenarios** - Double taxation relief
5. **In Article 7/9 comparison** - PE vs associated enterprises

### 8.2 Answer Framework

```
ARTICLE 9 EXAM FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. IDENTIFY ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES (2-3 marks)
   "Under Article 9(1), the enterprises are associated because..."
   - (a) Parent-subsidiary / capital participation, OR
   - (b) Common control / management

2. IDENTIFY NON-ARM'S LENGTH CONDITIONS (3-4 marks)
   "The conditions between the enterprises differ from those
   between independent enterprises because..."
   - Identify the transaction
   - Compare to arm's length benchmark
   - Quantify the difference if possible

3. APPLY ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE (4-5 marks)
   "Under Article 9(1), State A may include in Enterprise A's
   profits the amount that would have accrued if..."
   - Reference to OECD TP Guidelines methodology
   - Identify appropriate pricing method
   - Calculate adjustment

4. CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT (3-4 marks)
   "Under Article 9(2), State B shall make an appropriate
   adjustment to eliminate double taxation..."
   - Explain mechanism
   - Note conditions (agreement required)
   - Reference MAP if states disagree

5. UN MODEL DIFFERENCES (if asked) (2-3 marks)
   "Under the UN Model, Article 9(3) would deny corresponding
   adjustment if fraud/gross negligence..."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 8.3 Common Exam Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Treating Article 9 as self-executing | Article 9 authorises but requires domestic law to implement |
| Confusing Article 9 and Article 7 | Article 9 = separate entities; Article 7 = PE of same entity |
| Assuming automatic corresponding adjustment | Article 9(2) requires other state to agree |
| Ignoring link to TP Guidelines | Reference OECD Guidelines for methodology |
| Missing UN Article 9(3) | Note fraud exception in UN Model |

---

## 9. SUMMARY: KEY POINTS FOR EXAM

```
ARTICLE 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES - ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. BASIC RULE (Article 9(1))

   • "May be included": Authorisation, not obligation
   • Requires domestic law to implement

2. CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENTS (Article 9(2))
   • Eliminates double taxation from primary adjustment
   • "Shall make" - Obligation on other state
   • Subject to agreement between states
   • MAP consultation if disagreement

3. STATUS OF ARTICLE 9
   • Constitutional provision for transfer pricing
   • Does NOT provide detailed methodology
   • Links to OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
   • Enables domestic TP legislation

4. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER ARTICLES
   • Article 7: PE attribution (same entity) vs Article 9 (separate entities)
   • Articles 10, 11, 12: Article 9 may recharacterise payments
