# Chapter 8.3: Associated Enterprises – Article 9, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Purpose of Article 9

### 1.1. The Role of Article 9 in Treaty Architecture

Article 9 addresses the allocation of profits between associated enterprises—related parties operating in different tax jurisdictions. It provides the treaty framework for establishing the arm's length principle in international tax law, authorising tax authorities to adjust profits between related parties, requiring corresponding adjustments to eliminate double taxation, and linking domestic transfer pricing rules to international standards.

Article 9 is often described as the "constitutional provision" for transfer pricing in treaty law. It establishes the fundamental principle that transactions between related enterprises should be priced as if the parties were independent, dealing at arm's length. This principle forms the foundation of transfer pricing regimes worldwide.

### 1.2. Status of Article 9

Understanding the proper status of Article 9 is essential for examination purposes. Article 9 is not a comprehensive transfer pricing code. It establishes the arm's length principle as the applicable standard, authorises Contracting States to adjust profits where conditions differ from arm's length, requires corresponding adjustments under paragraph 2, and provides a framework for mutual agreement procedure on transfer pricing disputes. However, Article 9 does not provide detailed methodology for pricing transactions, specify which transfer pricing methods to use, operate without supporting domestic legislation, or self-execute adjustments automatically.

Article 9 functions as an enabling provision that works in conjunction with domestic transfer pricing legislation. It does not itself create taxing rights—rather, it allocates existing rights between associated enterprises and confirms that domestic law adjustments are treaty-compliant.

### 1.3. Link to Transfer Pricing Legislation

Article 9 provides the treaty basis for domestic transfer pricing rules. The relationship operates hierarchically: domestic law creates the primary obligation to price transactions at arm's length; Article 9 confirms this approach is consistent with treaty obligations; the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines provide detailed methodology; and Article 9(2) ensures relief from double taxation through corresponding adjustments.

This relationship was examined in the June 2023 examination, which noted that "Article 9 OECD MTC 2017 works in conjunction with Article 7 in relation to business profits of associated enterprises. Article 9 relies upon the arm's length principle."

## 2. Treaty Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 9(1) Text

Article 9(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 provides: "Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly."

### 2.2. Article 9(2) Text

Article 9(2) provides: "Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State—and taxes accordingly—profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other."

### 2.3. Structural Overview

Article 9(1)(a) defines vertical association through parent-subsidiary relationships where one enterprise participates in the management, control, or capital of another. Article 9(1)(b) defines horizontal association where the same persons participate in both enterprises, such as sister companies under common ownership. The main body of Article 9(1) establishes the arm's length principle and authorises profit adjustments. Article 9(2) provides for corresponding adjustments to eliminate double taxation.

## 3. Article 9(1): The Arm's Length Principle

### 3.1. Associated Enterprises Defined

Article 9(1) applies when enterprises are "associated" through participation in management, control, or capital. Under Article 9(1)(a), vertical association exists where an enterprise of one Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control, or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State. This covers parent-subsidiary relationships, holding company structures, and situations where one enterprise controls another's strategic decisions.

Under Article 9(1)(b), horizontal association exists where the same persons participate in the management, control, or capital of enterprises in both Contracting States. This covers sister companies under common ownership, enterprises controlled by the same individual shareholders, and companies under common management. The reference to "directly or indirectly" ensures that association through intermediate entities is captured, preventing artificial structuring to avoid Article 9's application.

### 3.2. The Arm's Length Standard

The arm's length principle requires transactions between associated enterprises to be priced as if they were between independent parties dealing at arm's length. The critical language in Article 9(1) refers to "conditions...which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises."

This formulation requires comparing actual conditions between associated enterprises with hypothetical conditions between independent enterprises. Where actual pricing differs from what independent enterprises would have agreed, Article 9(1) authorises adjustment. The arm's length principle treats members of a multinational group as operating as separate entities rather than as inseparable parts of a single unified business. This separate entity approach respects the legal structure of the group while ensuring that tax consequences reflect economic substance.

### 3.3. "May Be Included"—Authorisation Not Obligation

The phrase "may be included in the profits of that enterprise" in Article 9(1) is significant. Article 9(1) authorises adjustments but does not mandate them. The Contracting State has discretion to make adjustments, but actual implementation requires domestic legislation. Article 9 provides treaty cover for domestic transfer pricing rules without itself creating the adjustment mechanism.

This distinction is important: Article 9 does not self-execute. It confirms that adjustments made under domestic transfer pricing law are consistent with treaty obligations, but the primary legal basis for adjustment remains domestic law.

### 3.4. Relationship with OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines

The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations provide detailed guidance on applying the arm's length principle. While not part of the treaty text, the Guidelines are referenced in the Commentary to Article 9 and are widely adopted by OECD and non-OECD countries.

The Guidelines establish a hierarchy of sources for transfer pricing analysis: the treaty text of Article 9 establishes the arm's length principle; the Commentary explains the treaty provisions and references the Guidelines; the Guidelines themselves provide detailed methodology including the five transfer pricing methods and comparability analysis; domestic legislation implements the rules; and domestic guidance provides tax authority interpretations and safe harbours.

As of 2024, 117 Inclusive Framework jurisdictions representing 96% of world GDP have incorporated the arm's length principle into their domestic law, with a significant number basing their legislation on the OECD Guidelines. The February 2024 update to the Guidelines incorporated Amount B of Pillar One, introducing a simplified approach for baseline marketing and distribution activities with particular focus on low-capacity jurisdictions.

## 4. Article 9(2): Corresponding Adjustments

### 4.1. Purpose and Mechanism

Article 9(2) addresses the double taxation that can arise from transfer pricing adjustments. When State A makes a primary adjustment increasing Enterprise A's profits, those profits may already have been taxed in State B as part of Enterprise B's income. Without relief, the same profits would be taxed twice—once in each jurisdiction.

Article 9(2) requires State B to make a "corresponding adjustment" to eliminate this double taxation. The adjustment may take the form of reducing Enterprise B's taxable income or providing relief through tax credit or refund mechanisms. The 2025 OECD Model Tax Convention update significantly reworked the Commentary on Article 9, clarifying that the corresponding adjustment obligation ensures the allocation of profits between jurisdictions is consistent with arm's length conditions.

### 4.2. Conditions for Corresponding Adjustment

The obligation to make a corresponding adjustment requires that State A has made a primary adjustment by including additional profits in Enterprise A's income; those profits were already taxed in State B in Enterprise B's hands; the primary adjustment reflects arm's length conditions—what independent enterprises would have done; and due regard is given to other treaty provisions.

The language "shall make an appropriate adjustment" creates an obligation on the other Contracting State. However, State B is only obligated if it agrees the primary adjustment is appropriate. Where State B disagrees with State A's characterisation, competent authorities must consult through the mutual agreement procedure under Article 25. The adjustment must be "appropriate"—not necessarily a pound-for-pound mirror of the primary adjustment—and State B may refuse if the primary adjustment exceeds what arm's length conditions would support.

### 4.3. Played Holding AB v Skatteverket (2024)

The Swedish Supreme Administrative Court's decision in Played Holding AB v Skatteverket (November 2024) represents significant case law on Article 9(2) corresponding adjustments. The case involved a Swedish parent company that loaned money to its Norwegian subsidiary at interest. Norwegian tax authorities denied part of the interest deduction as exceeding arm's length, while Sweden taxed the full interest received.

The Supreme Administrative Court held that Sweden is bound to apply Article 9(2) of the Nordic Treaty, which is patterned on the OECD Model. The court ruled that Swedish tax authorities must apply the treaty's corresponding adjustment obligation, not merely in their capacity as competent authority for treaty purposes, but as part of the assessment process itself. Furthermore, a taxpayer dissatisfied with the assessment may appeal to the courts, which may determine whether a corresponding adjustment is "justified both in principle and in amount."

This decision is significant because it establishes that corresponding adjustments can be claimed as of right through domestic court proceedings, rather than only through competent authority procedures. The case shines light on what has been described as a "largely dark corner" of transfer pricing law, where recourse to mutual agreement procedure has historically meant few judicial decisions on Article 9(2).

## 5. UN Model Differences

### 5.1. Article 9(3)—Fraud Exception

The UN Model includes Article 9(1) and 9(2) substantially similar to the OECD Model but adds Article 9(3), which is not present in the OECD Model. UN Article 9(3) provides that the corresponding adjustment obligation under paragraph 2 shall not apply where judicial, administrative, or other legal proceedings have resulted in a final ruling that actions giving rise to the primary adjustment involve fraud, gross negligence, or wilful default.

This provision denies corresponding adjustments where there has been a final ruling of wrongdoing. It reflects developing country concerns about protecting their tax base from abusive transactions. The OECD Model does not include this exception, meaning corresponding adjustments are required in all cases where the primary adjustment is arm's length appropriate, regardless of the taxpayer's conduct.

### 5.2. Commentary Differences

The UN Commentary to Article 9 emphasises capacity concerns, noting that developing countries may lack resources for complex transfer pricing analysis. The Commentary recognises alternative approaches such as fixed profit margins and simplified methods including safe harbours for smaller transactions. The UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries (2021) provides additional guidance tailored to developing country circumstances.

## 6. Relationship with Other Articles

### 6.1. Article 9 and Article 7

Article 9 and Article 7 both apply the arm's length principle to profit allocation, but address different situations. Article 9 applies to transactions between separate legal entities—associated enterprises such as parent and subsidiary companies. The transactions are legally enforceable contracts between distinct persons, and the adjustment reallocates profits between those entities.

Article 7 applies to profit attribution within a single legal entity—between a permanent establishment and its head office. The "dealings" between PE and head office have no legal effect but are recognised for tax purposes. Both articles use similar language: Article 9 refers to "conditions which would be made between independent enterprises" while Article 7(2) refers to profits the PE "might be expected to make...if it were a separate and independent enterprise." The distinction between separate entities (Article 9) and permanent establishments (Article 7) was examined in the June 2023 examination.

### 6.2. Interaction with Articles 10, 11, and 12

Article 9 can interact with the specific income articles governing dividends, interest, and royalties. Where payments between associated enterprises exceed arm's length amounts, Article 9 may authorise recharacterisation. Excessive management charges may be treated as hidden dividends under Article 10. Excessive interest payments may be recharacterised, with only the arm's length portion qualifying for Article 11 treatment. The interaction between Article 9 and Article 11 regarding interest payments was specifically examined in June 2022.

Article 9 operates as a corrective provision: first identify the nature of the payment; then apply the relevant distributive article; if conditions differ from arm's length, Article 9 authorises adjustment; finally re-apply the distributive article to the adjusted amount.

## 7. Arm's Length Principle versus Global Formulary Apportionment

### 7.1. The Two Approaches Compared

The June 2023 examination tested the comparison between the arm's length principle and global formulary apportionment as alternative methods for allocating multinational profits.

The arm's length principle analyses transactions on a transaction-by-transaction basis, comparing controlled transactions to comparable uncontrolled transactions using one of the five OECD methods. It respects legal structures and provides flexibility to adapt to specific facts, but is complex and costly to apply. Comparable data may not exist, and the approach can produce a range of outcomes leading to disputes.

Global formulary apportionment combines worldwide profits of the multinational group and apportions them to each jurisdiction by formula, typically based on factors such as sales, assets, and payroll. It is simpler to administer, less susceptible to manipulation, and requires no comparables, but the allocation is inherently arbitrary depending on formula choice. Different formulas adopted by different jurisdictions would create double taxation, and there is no international consensus supporting this approach.

### 7.2. OECD Position

The OECD Commentary firmly endorses the arm's length principle and rejects global formulary apportionment. The Commentary states that the arm's length principle "treats members of an MNE group as operating as separate entities rather than as inseparable parts of a single unified business." The OECD preference rests on theoretical soundness in respecting separate legal personality, decades of practical application experience, international consensus avoiding conflicting formulas, and flexibility to adapt to different industries and transactions.

However, OECD/G20 Pillar One Amount A introduces a formulaic element for certain large multinationals, representing a limited departure from pure arm's length analysis for the largest and most profitable enterprises.

## 8. Recent Developments

### 8.1. 2025 OECD Model Tax Convention Update

The 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention significantly reworked the Commentary on Article 9, reaffirming the central role of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines in interpreting the arm's length principle. The update clarifies that Article 9 adjustments may only be made where transactions are not at arm's length, and that procedural issues such as burden of proof fall under Article 24 (non-discrimination), not Article 9 itself.

The Commentary now explicitly addresses the interaction between Article 9 and domestic rules on thin capitalisation and interest limitation, including the BEPS Action 4 recommendations. This coordination ensures that domestic interest limitation rules and treaty-based profit allocation operate coherently.

### 8.2. European Union Developments

In September 2023, the European Commission proposed harmonising key transfer pricing rules across the EU, including the arm's length principle, with a proposed implementation date of 1 January 2026. The proposal sought to clarify the role and status of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines within the EU framework. However, in December 2024, the Council concluded that a majority of Member States did not support the proposal in its current form. Some Member States continue technical discussions, and there is exploration of creating a Transfer Pricing Platform outside the directive framework for non-binding cooperation on practical issues.

### 8.3. Global Adoption

The arm's length principle continues to expand globally. As of December 2024, over 50% of jurisdictions have introduced domestic transfer pricing legislation, with many non-OECD members referring to or aligning with the Guidelines. The incorporation of Amount B into the Guidelines in February 2024 provides simplified approaches particularly beneficial for developing countries and low-capacity jurisdictions dealing with baseline distribution arrangements.

The divergence between treaty-based corresponding adjustments and domestic law mechanisms remains an area of ongoing development, as the Played Holding AB decision demonstrates the potential for judicial enforcement of Article 9(2) obligations outside the traditional mutual agreement procedure framework.
