## Chapter 16: The Impact of the Non-Discrimination Article – Article 24, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 24

Article 24 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) establishes the non-discrimination principle in international taxation. Unlike the distributive articles (Articles 6-21) that allocate taxing rights between states, or the method articles (Articles 23A and 23B) that eliminate double taxation, Article 24 ensures that taxation does not discriminate on prohibited grounds—primarily nationality and certain ownership structures.

The non-discrimination article operates as a safeguard against tax measures that, while not affecting the allocation of taxing rights, create unequal treatment between similarly situated taxpayers. A state may retain its full taxing rights under the treaty but must exercise those rights without discrimination based on the prohibited criteria.

#### 1.2. Policy Rationale

The policy rationale underlying Article 24 reflects fundamental principles of equal treatment in international economic relations. Discrimination in taxation can distort investment decisions, impede capital flows, and undermine the treaty's objective of promoting international trade and investment. By prohibiting certain forms of discriminatory taxation, Article 24 complements the treaty's broader objective of reducing tax obstacles to cross-border economic activity.

The non-discrimination provisions also reflect the relationship between tax treaties and broader international obligations. Discrimination based on nationality may conflict with international trade law, regional agreements, and general principles of international law. Article 24 provides treaty-based protection that reinforces these broader non-discrimination norms in the specific context of taxation.

#### 1.3. Scope and Limitations

Article 24's non-discrimination rules apply to taxation but not to every aspect of a state's tax system. The article prohibits discrimination based on specific criteria while permitting distinctions based on residence—a fundamental distinction that pervades international tax law. The difference between discrimination based on nationality (prohibited) and differentiation based on residence (generally permitted) is central to understanding Article 24's operation.

The article's protection extends beyond income taxes to taxes of every kind and description, broadening its scope considerably beyond the treaty's primary focus. However, Article 24 does not create an obligation for states to provide most-favoured-nation treatment or extend benefits granted to third-country nationals.

#### 1.4. Historical Development

Article 24 has been part of the OECD Model since the 1963 Draft Convention, reflecting early recognition that non-discrimination principles required treaty-level protection. The original 1963 formulation contained provisions substantially similar to the current text, though subsequent updates have refined the article's scope and application.

The 1977 Model introduced significant clarifications to paragraph 2's treatment of stateless persons. The original 1963 provision did not require that stateless persons be residents of a Contracting State to benefit from protection. This created potential for extending treaty benefits to persons with tenuous connections to either treaty partner. The 1977 amendment resolved this concern by requiring residence in a Contracting State as a precondition for paragraph 2 protection.

The relationship between Article 24 and domestic anti-avoidance measures has evolved considerably. The OECD's 1986 Report on Thin Capitalisation addressed the interaction between non-discrimination provisions and rules limiting interest deductions on excessive related-party debt. Subsequent Commentary updates have sought to balance states' legitimate interest in preventing base erosion against their non-discrimination obligations, recognising that certain anti-avoidance measures may be justified despite their differential impact on foreign-owned enterprises.

The 2017 BEPS-driven updates did not substantially amend Article 24's text but added Commentary guidance on the interaction between non-discrimination provisions and the new anti-avoidance measures introduced through BEPS Actions. This guidance confirms that measures designed to prevent treaty abuse generally do not violate non-discrimination provisions where they apply objective criteria rather than nationality-based distinctions.

### 2. The Text of Article 24

#### 2.1. OECD Model Article 24 (2017)

Article 24 contains six paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1**: "Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected."

**Paragraph 2**: "Stateless persons who are residents of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in either Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of the State concerned in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected."

**Paragraph 3**: "The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities."

**Paragraph 4**: "Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 6 of Article 11, or paragraph 4 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State."

**Paragraph 5**: "Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected."

**Paragraph 6**: "The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description."

#### 2.2. Structure and Logic

The article follows a logical progression from individual nationality-based discrimination to enterprise-level discrimination. Paragraph 1 establishes the foundational nationality non-discrimination rule. Paragraph 2 extends equivalent protection to stateless persons. Paragraph 3 addresses permanent establishment taxation. Paragraph 4 deals with deductibility of cross-border payments. Paragraph 5 prevents discrimination based on foreign ownership. Paragraph 6 broadens the article's scope beyond income taxes.

This structure ensures comprehensive protection against the most significant forms of tax discrimination in international commerce. Each paragraph addresses a distinct factual situation where discriminatory treatment might otherwise occur.

### 3. Detailed Analysis of Each Paragraph

#### 3.1. Paragraph 1: Nationality Non-Discrimination

Paragraph 1 prohibits discrimination based on nationality, requiring that foreign nationals not be subjected to taxation that is "other or more burdensome" than taxation on the host state's own nationals "in the same circumstances." The phrase "in particular with respect to residence" clarifies that the comparison is between persons with the same residence status—resident foreign nationals compared to resident domestic nationals, or non-resident foreign nationals compared to non-resident domestic nationals.

This formulation permits residence-based distinctions while prohibiting nationality-based distinctions. A state may tax non-residents less favourably than residents without violating paragraph 1, because the comparison is between persons of different residence status. However, a state may not tax non-resident foreign nationals less favourably than non-resident domestic nationals.

The term "nationals" includes both natural persons and legal entities. For legal entities, nationality is typically determined by the state under whose laws the entity is created or organised. This extends protection to companies, partnerships, and other entities constituted under the laws of either Contracting State. *(covered in June 2025)*

#### 3.2. Paragraph 2: Stateless Persons

Paragraph 2 extends non-discrimination protection to stateless persons who are residents of a Contracting State. Such persons must not be treated less favourably than nationals of the host state in the same circumstances. This provision recognises that stateless persons, lacking the protection of any nationality, require specific treaty safeguards.

The practical importance of paragraph 2 has diminished as the number of stateless persons has declined, but the provision remains significant for affected individuals. Some countries, including India, have reserved the right to exclude paragraph 2 from their treaties, reflecting concerns about the administrative complexity of applying statelessness criteria.

#### 3.3. Paragraph 3: Permanent Establishment Non-Discrimination

Paragraph 3 addresses a critical issue in international taxation: whether permanent establishments of foreign enterprises may be taxed less favourably than domestic enterprises carrying on the same activities. The provision requires that PE taxation "shall not be less favourably levied" than taxation on comparable domestic enterprises.

The comparison is between the taxation of the permanent establishment and the taxation of domestic enterprises carrying on "the same activities"—not the same business in identical circumstances. This requires comparison of enterprises in the same line of business or industry, not necessarily in identical factual situations.

Important limitations apply to paragraph 3. The Commentary confirms that paragraph 3 does not require states to grant permanent establishments personal allowances, reliefs, and reductions for taxation purposes that are granted only to residents. Similarly, paragraph 3 does not prevent the application of branch profits taxes or branch-level interest taxes that apply specifically to PEs.

Case law has clarified paragraph 3's scope. In Mitsubishi Corporation India v Indian Tax Authorities (2014), the Indian Tax Tribunal considered whether disallowing deductions for payments to a Japanese parent company, on grounds not applicable to payments to Indian residents, violated the non-discrimination article. The tribunal examined whether the differential treatment of withholding tax obligations constituted prohibited discrimination. Courts across jurisdictions have generally interpreted paragraph 3 as requiring functional equivalence in tax treatment rather than identical treatment in every respect.

#### 3.4. Paragraph 4: Deductibility of Payments

Paragraph 4 ensures that enterprises are not disadvantaged when making payments to non-residents rather than residents. Interest, royalties, and other disbursements paid to non-residents must be deductible under the same conditions as if paid to residents.

This provision is subject to important exceptions. It does not apply where the anti-avoidance provisions of Article 9 (associated enterprises), Article 11(6) (excess interest), or Article 12(4) (excess royalties) permit deduction limitations. These exceptions preserve the operation of transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules that limit deductions where related-party payments exceed arm's length amounts.

The practical effect is that thin capitalisation rules that limit interest deductions on related-party debt must apply equally to payments to residents and non-residents. A rule that denies interest deductions only on payments to foreign affiliates while permitting full deductions on payments to domestic affiliates would violate paragraph 4, subject to the Article 9 exception.

#### 3.5. Paragraph 5: Ownership Non-Discrimination

Paragraph 5 prevents discrimination against domestic enterprises based on foreign ownership. Enterprises owned or controlled by residents of the other Contracting State must not be subjected to more burdensome taxation than other similar domestic enterprises.

The comparison is between similar domestic enterprises with different ownership structures—not between domestic and foreign enterprises. A state may not impose higher taxes on a domestic subsidiary with foreign parents than on an identical domestic subsidiary with domestic parents.

This provision has significant implications for thin capitalisation rules. Rules that limit interest deductions only for foreign-owned companies, while permitting unlimited deductions for domestically-owned companies, may violate paragraph 5. However, thin capitalisation rules that apply equally to all companies, regardless of the residence of their shareholders, generally do not violate paragraph 5. *(covered in December 2023)*

The interaction between paragraph 5 and domestic anti-avoidance rules requires careful analysis. The OECD Commentary confirms that paragraph 5 does not prevent states from applying controlled foreign company (CFC) rules to tax shareholders on undistributed foreign subsidiary income, as such rules tax the shareholders rather than the foreign-owned enterprise.

#### 3.6. Paragraph 6: Scope of Taxes Covered

Paragraph 6 significantly broadens Article 24's scope by applying its non-discrimination rules to "taxes of every kind and description"—not merely the income and capital taxes covered by Article 2. This extension encompasses value-added taxes, customs duties, stamp duties, inheritance taxes, and other levies beyond the treaty's primary scope.

The broad scope reflects the policy concern that discrimination may occur through any type of taxation. Limiting non-discrimination protection to income taxes would permit states to discriminate through other levies, undermining Article 24's objective.

### 4. UN Model Comparison

#### 4.1. Substantive Similarity

The UN Model Convention Article 24 is substantially similar to the OECD Model, reflecting international consensus on non-discrimination principles. Both models contain the same six paragraphs with nearly identical wording. The minor textual variations do not affect the substantive operation of the provisions.

#### 4.2. Developing Country Considerations

While the text is similar, developing countries may approach non-discrimination provisions with particular concerns. Source countries may wish to preserve policy flexibility for tax incentives, investment screening, or industrial policy measures that could theoretically engage non-discrimination analysis.

The UN Commentary notes that developing countries should carefully consider whether proposed tax measures might conflict with non-discrimination obligations. Targeted incentives for certain sectors or regions generally do not engage Article 24 unless they distinguish on nationality or ownership grounds.

### 5. Practical Application

#### 5.1. Interaction with Thin Capitalisation Rules

Thin capitalisation rules limiting interest deductions on excessive debt represent a significant area of Article 24 application. The interaction depends on the rule's design:

Rules that apply only to foreign-owned companies may violate paragraph 5's ownership non-discrimination protection. Courts in various jurisdictions have examined whether denying interest deductions to subsidiaries of foreign parents, on grounds not applicable to domestically-owned companies, violates non-discrimination provisions. The OECD Commentary acknowledges this tension and provides guidance on reconciling thin capitalisation objectives with non-discrimination obligations. *(covered in June 2024)*

Rules that apply equally to all highly-leveraged companies, regardless of ownership, generally do not violate paragraph 5. Modern thin capitalisation rules and earnings-stripping provisions increasingly adopt ownership-neutral designs partly to ensure treaty compliance.

#### 5.2. Case Law Development

Courts have interpreted Article 24 in numerous cases addressing diverse factual situations. Key interpretive principles include:

The comparator analysis requires identifying appropriate comparable situations. The phrase "in the same circumstances" permits substantial flexibility in determining comparability, and courts have adopted varying approaches to this analysis.

The "other or more burdensome" standard encompasses both quantitative burdens (higher rates or amounts) and qualitative burdens (more onerous procedures or requirements connected with taxation).

### 6. Commentary Analysis

#### 6.1. Key Commentary Provisions

The Commentary on Article 24 provides extensive guidance on each paragraph's interpretation. Commentary paragraph 1 emphasises that Article 24 applies regardless of whether the persons concerned are residents of the Contracting States, extending protection to third-country nationals subject to taxation in either Contracting State.

The Commentary addresses the relationship between paragraphs 4 and 5 and thin capitalisation rules in detail, acknowledging the potential tension between non-discrimination obligations and legitimate anti-avoidance measures.

#### 6.2. Reservations and Observations

Several countries have entered reservations or observations on Article 24. Common reservations include:

- The right to exclude paragraph 2 (stateless persons)
- The right to maintain specific thin capitalisation rules
- The right to maintain branch profits taxes

These reservations reflect countries' desire to preserve specific domestic policies that might otherwise engage non-discrimination analysis.

### 7. Relationship with Other Articles

#### 7.1. Interaction with Distributive Articles

Article 24's non-discrimination provisions operate alongside, not in replacement of, the distributive articles. A state that exercises taxing rights permitted under Articles 6 through 21 does not violate Article 24 merely because it taxes foreign residents or foreign-source income. The distributive articles themselves allocate taxing rights between states, and Article 24 addresses how those rights are exercised rather than their existence.

However, the manner in which a state implements its distributive article rights may engage Article 24 analysis. For example, if a state imposes higher withholding rates on dividends paid to foreign nationals than on dividends paid to domestic nationals (both non-residents), paragraph 1 would be engaged. The critical distinction is between the existence of taxing rights (addressed by distributive articles) and the exercise of those rights (addressed by Article 24).

#### 7.2. Relationship with Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure)

Article 24 disputes may be resolved through the Mutual Agreement Procedure established in Article 25. Where a taxpayer believes taxation has been imposed contrary to Article 24's provisions, they may present their case to the competent authority. This provides a mechanism for addressing non-discrimination complaints through inter-governmental consultation rather than litigation.

The availability of MAP relief for Article 24 complaints reflects the article's importance within the treaty framework. Non-discrimination concerns warrant the same dispute resolution mechanisms available for other treaty provisions.

### 8. Emerging Issues

#### 8.1. Digital Economy Taxation

New digital services taxes and similar measures may raise non-discrimination concerns if they apply differently based on the residence or nationality of the enterprise. Measures targeting foreign digital companies while exempting comparable domestic enterprises could potentially engage Article 24, though the analysis depends on specific measure design and the applicable treaties.

#### 8.2. Minimum Tax and Non-Discrimination

The OECD/G20 Pillar Two global minimum tax framework raises questions about non-discrimination interactions. The Income Inclusion Rule and Undertaxed Payments Rule apply based on the location and taxation of group entities, potentially creating distinctions based on foreign ownership or control. The interaction between these measures and Article 24 obligations remains an evolving area of analysis.
