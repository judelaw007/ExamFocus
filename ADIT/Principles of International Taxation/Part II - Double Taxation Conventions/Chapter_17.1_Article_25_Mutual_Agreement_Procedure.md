## Chapter 17.1: Competent Authority/Mutual Agreement Procedures – Article 25, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of the MAP

Article 25 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) establishes the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)—a mechanism through which the competent authorities of the Contracting States may resolve disputes arising from the interpretation or application of the treaty. The MAP provides an alternative to domestic judicial remedies, offering taxpayers a diplomatic avenue for resolving cross-border tax disputes.

The fundamental purpose of the MAP is to ensure that the treaty's objectives are achieved in practice. Even with carefully drafted treaty provisions, disputes may arise regarding their interpretation or application to specific factual situations. The MAP provides a structured framework for competent authorities to communicate directly and resolve such disputes, thereby preventing or eliminating double taxation not intended by the treaty.

#### 1.2. Relationship with Domestic Remedies

The MAP operates independently of domestic legal remedies. A taxpayer may pursue MAP relief while simultaneously pursuing domestic appeals or litigation, unless domestic law specifically prohibits such parallel proceedings. This independence is significant because it allows taxpayers to seek resolution through multiple channels, though practical considerations may favour one approach over another in specific circumstances.

The Commentary clarifies that access to the MAP should not be conditional upon exhausting domestic remedies. The procedure is designed to supplement, not replace, the ordinary legal remedies available under domestic law. However, if a court renders a final decision on the disputed issue, competent authorities may be constrained in their ability to reach a different conclusion through the MAP.

#### 1.3. Historical Development

The MAP has been a feature of tax treaties since the earliest model conventions. The 1963 OECD Draft Convention included Article 25 provisions substantially similar to those in current models, reflecting the recognition that treaty implementation required a mechanism for resolving disputes between treaty partners.

The most significant evolution occurred with the introduction of arbitration provisions. The OECD first included optional arbitration language in 2008, responding to concerns that the traditional MAP's best-endeavours approach left taxpayers without recourse when competent authorities could not reach agreement. The BEPS project's Action 14 further strengthened the MAP framework by establishing binding minimum standards and peer review mechanisms.

The 2017 OECD Model updates consolidated these developments, incorporating mandatory binding arbitration as part of the main text rather than as an optional provision. This evolution reflects growing international consensus that effective dispute resolution requires a guaranteed resolution mechanism, though developing countries continue to express reservations about mandatory arbitration's implications for sovereignty.

### 2. The Text of Article 25

#### 2.1. OECD Model Article 25 (2017)

Article 25 contains five paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1**: Addresses the initiation of the MAP. A person who considers that actions of one or both Contracting States result or will result in taxation not in accordance with the treaty may present the case to the competent authority of either Contracting State. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the treaty.

**Paragraph 2**: Requires the competent authority, if it considers the taxpayer's objection justified and cannot itself arrive at a satisfactory solution, to endeavour to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to avoiding taxation not in accordance with the treaty.

**Paragraph 3**: Provides that competent authorities shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

**Paragraph 4**: States that competent authorities may communicate directly with each other, including through a joint commission, for reaching agreement under the preceding paragraphs.

**Paragraph 5**: Introduces mandatory binding arbitration. Where a person has presented a case under paragraph 1 and the competent authorities are unable to reach agreement within two years, any unresolved issues shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests in writing. The arbitration decision is binding on both States.

#### 2.2. Key 2017 Changes

The 2017 update to the OECD Model introduced significant changes to Article 25, reflecting the outcomes of BEPS Action 14. The most notable change to paragraph 1 allows a taxpayer to present the case to the competent authority of either Contracting State, not merely the State of residence as previously required. This change ensures broader access to the MAP and recognises that either competent authority should have the opportunity to consider whether a case warrants discussion.

The arbitration provisions in paragraph 5 were also refined to clarify procedural aspects and reinforce the binding nature of arbitration decisions.

### 3. Detailed Analysis of Each Paragraph

#### 3.1. Paragraph 1: Initiation of MAP

Paragraph 1 establishes the gateway to the MAP. The taxpayer must demonstrate that actions of one or both States result, or will result, in taxation not in accordance with the treaty. The three-year time limit runs from the "first notification" of the action—typically the date of the assessment notice or equivalent communication informing the taxpayer of the disputed taxation. *(covered in June 2024)*

The 2017 change allowing presentation to either State's competent authority represents a significant procedural improvement. Previously, taxpayers were required to approach their State of residence, which could create difficulties in cases where the residence State was the State imposing the allegedly non-compliant taxation. The current formulation provides flexibility and ensures that both competent authorities can engage with the case from the outset.

#### 3.2. Paragraph 2: Endeavour to Resolve

Paragraph 2 creates an obligation for the competent authority to "endeavour" to resolve justified cases through mutual agreement. This best-endeavours obligation does not guarantee resolution—competent authorities are not required to reach agreement. However, the obligation is meaningful: competent authorities must genuinely attempt to resolve the dispute and cannot simply refuse to engage.

The process typically involves the competent authority of one State presenting a position paper to its counterpart, followed by exchanges of views and, where necessary, face-to-face meetings. The goal is reaching a mutually acceptable resolution that eliminates the taxation not in accordance with the treaty.

#### 3.3. Paragraph 3: Interpretation and Application

Paragraph 3 extends the MAP beyond specific taxpayer cases to general interpretive issues. Competent authorities may use this provision to agree on the interpretation of treaty terms, resolve systematic application issues, or develop common approaches to recurring situations. Unlike paragraph 1, there is no time limit for paragraph 3 consultations.

The scope of paragraph 3 is broader than dispute resolution—it encompasses proactive consultation to prevent disputes from arising. Competent authorities may issue joint guidance, clarify ambiguous provisions, or address novel situations not explicitly covered by the treaty text.

#### 3.4. Paragraph 4: Direct Communication

Paragraph 4 facilitates the practical operation of the MAP by authorising direct communication between competent authorities. This eliminates the need for diplomatic channels, which would otherwise slow the resolution process significantly. The provision also contemplates the establishment of joint commissions for ongoing bilateral consultation.

#### 3.5. Paragraph 5: Arbitration

Paragraph 5 addresses the fundamental weakness of the traditional MAP—the absence of a guaranteed outcome. Under paragraphs 1-4, competent authorities are obliged only to endeavour to reach agreement; if they cannot agree, the taxpayer has no recourse through the MAP itself.

Paragraph 5 resolves this by providing for mandatory binding arbitration where competent authorities fail to reach agreement within two years. The taxpayer must request arbitration in writing, and unresolved issues are then submitted to an arbitration panel whose decision binds both States. The decision must be implemented notwithstanding any domestic time limits.

Important limitations apply: arbitration is not available if a court or administrative tribunal of either State has already rendered a decision on the issues. This prevents arbitration from overriding judicial determinations and preserves the primacy of domestic courts on matters already judicially resolved.

### 4. UN Model Comparison

#### 4.1. Alternative A and Alternative B

The UN Model offers two alternatives for Article 25. Alternative A mirrors the OECD Model without the mandatory arbitration provisions of paragraph 5. Alternative B includes arbitration but with distinct procedural features, including a three-year resolution period before arbitration becomes available (compared to the OECD's two years) and the possibility of competent authority-initiated arbitration.

The existence of these alternatives reflects different perspectives on arbitration's appropriateness in tax treaty disputes. Developing countries have historically been more cautious about mandatory arbitration, viewing it as potentially constraining their sovereignty and favouring developed-country interests. Alternative A preserves this flexibility while Alternative B offers a middle ground for countries willing to accept arbitration with modified terms.

### 5. BEPS Action 14 and the Minimum Standard

BEPS Action 14 established a minimum standard for MAP effectiveness, consisting of 21 elements and 12 best practices. Countries participating in the Inclusive Framework commit to implementing this standard and submit to peer review of their MAP practices. *(covered in December 2023)*

The minimum standard addresses four key areas: preventing disputes, ensuring access to MAP, resolving MAP cases, and implementing MAP agreements. Participating jurisdictions commit to resolving MAP cases within an average timeframe of 24 months and to publishing MAP profiles according to an agreed template.

The peer review process launched in 2016 has evaluated over 80 jurisdictions, identifying areas requiring improvement and monitoring implementation of recommendations. This systematic oversight has significantly enhanced the effectiveness and consistency of MAP practices globally.

### 6. Practical Application

#### 6.1. When to Use MAP

Taxpayers should consider the MAP when facing double taxation or taxation they believe contravenes treaty provisions. Common situations include transfer pricing adjustments, disputes over treaty residence, and disagreements about the characterisation of income. The MAP may be particularly attractive where domestic remedies are uncertain or where bilateral resolution offers advantages over unilateral litigation.

#### 6.2. Process Overview

A typical MAP case proceeds through several stages: initial presentation to the competent authority, preliminary assessment of whether the case is justified, position paper development, bilateral discussions, and (if successful) a mutual agreement. If agreement cannot be reached and arbitration is available, the case may proceed to arbitration under paragraph 5.

The timeframes involved can be substantial, though BEPS Action 14 has driven improvements. Countries now publish statistics on MAP case inventories and resolution times, providing transparency that helps taxpayers assess the likely duration of proceedings.

#### 6.3. Advantages and Limitations

The MAP offers several advantages over domestic litigation. It provides access to officials with specialised expertise in treaty interpretation, avoids the costs and delays of formal court proceedings, and offers the possibility of a negotiated outcome that addresses both States' concerns. For transfer pricing disputes in particular, the MAP may be the only effective mechanism for achieving correlative adjustments that eliminate double taxation.

However, limitations exist. The best-endeavours nature of paragraphs 1-4 means resolution is not guaranteed. The process can be lengthy, with complex cases taking several years even with improved timeframes. Taxpayers have limited visibility into bilateral discussions between competent authorities, and the outcome may not fully align with their expectations. Where arbitration is available, these limitations are mitigated, but arbitration itself introduces additional procedural complexity and is not universally accepted.

The choice between MAP and domestic remedies—or the decision to pursue both in parallel—requires careful analysis of the specific circumstances, including the nature of the dispute, the likely duration and cost of each route, and the precedential implications of any outcome.
