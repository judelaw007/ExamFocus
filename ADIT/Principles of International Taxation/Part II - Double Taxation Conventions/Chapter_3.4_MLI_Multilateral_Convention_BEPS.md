## A. INTRODUCTION: THE NEED FOR A MULTILATERAL INSTRUMENT

### 1. The Problem: Updating 3,000+ Bilateral Treaties

The BEPS Project identified that many of its recommendations required changes to existing bilateral DTAs. However, the DTA network presented a significant implementation challenge:

| Challenge | Scale |
|-----------|-------|
| Number of bilateral DTAs worldwide | ~3,000+ |
| Time to negotiate single DTA | 2-10 years |
| Countries unable to negotiate simultaneously | Most can only handle a few per year |
| BEPS recommendations requiring treaty changes | Multiple (Actions 2, 6, 7, 14) |

Traditional bilateral renegotiation would have taken **decades** to implement BEPS treaty measures across the entire DTA network.

### 2. The Solution: BEPS Action 15

BEPS Action 15 recommended development of a **multilateral instrument** to modify existing bilateral tax treaties in a **synchronised and efficient manner**.

> "The MLI is a creative solution to square bilateralism with multilateralism" - Alschner (2019)

## B. HOW THE MLI WORKS

### 1. Legal Mechanism: Overlay Treaty

The MLI does **not** directly amend the text of existing treaties. Instead, it operates as an **overlay** that applies **alongside** existing treaties.

```
MLI LEGAL OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXISTING BILATERAL DTA          MLI (Multilateral)
┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │         │                     │
│  Original text      │         │  BEPS provisions    │
│  remains unchanged  │◄────────│  apply alongside    │
│                     │         │                     │
└─────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘
           │                              │
           └──────────┬───────────────────┘
                      ▼
         ┌────────────────────────┐
         │   SYNTHESISED TEXT     │
         │                        │
         │ Shows how DTA reads    │
         │ as modified by MLI     │
         └────────────────────────┘

VCLT Article 30(3): Later treaty prevails over earlier treaty
covering same subject matter (to extent of incompatibility)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Key Points:**
- Original DTA text remains unchanged
- MLI provisions **coexist** with DTA in hierarchical relationship
- Where MLI conflicts with DTA, MLI prevails (per VCLT Article 30(3))
- **Synthesised texts** published showing combined effect

### 2. Covered Tax Agreements (CTAs)

The MLI only applies to treaties that **both** parties designate as **Covered Tax Agreements (CTAs)**.

```
CTA DESIGNATION PROCESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                    Country A                Country B
                        │                        │
                        ▼                        ▼
              ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
              │ Lists A-B DTA   │      │ Lists A-B DTA   │
              │ as CTA          │      │ as CTA          │
              └────────┬────────┘      └────────┬────────┘
                       │                        │
                       └───────────┬────────────┘
                                   ▼
                    ┌──────────────────────────┐
                    │ A-B DTA becomes a CTA    │
                    │ → MLI provisions apply   │
                    └──────────────────────────┘

If ONLY ONE country lists the DTA → NOT a CTA → MLI does NOT apply

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Flexibility Mechanisms

The MLI provides significant **flexibility** to accommodate different countries' treaty policies:

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Opt-in provisions** | Country must actively choose to apply provision |
| **Opt-out provisions** | Provision applies unless country reserves against it |
| **Reservations** | Country can exclude application of certain provisions |
| **Notifications** | Country specifies which CTAs and provisions apply |
| **Alternative provisions** | Choice between different formulations |

**Result:** Each CTA may be modified differently depending on both parties' choices.

### 4. MLI Positions

Each jurisdiction must notify OECD of its **MLI position**:
- At signature: Provisional choices
- At ratification: Confirmed choices

MLI positions and synthesised texts are published on the [OECD MLI Database](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/beps-multilateral-instrument.html).

---

## D. BEPS MINIMUM STANDARDS IN THE MLI

### 1. What Are Minimum Standards?

**Minimum standards** are BEPS measures that **all** Inclusive Framework members committed to implement. For treaty-related measures, the MLI provides the implementation mechanism.

The MLI implements **two** of the four BEPS minimum standards:
1. **Action 6**: Preventing treaty abuse
2. **Action 14**: Making dispute resolution more effective

### 2. Treaty Abuse Minimum Standard (Articles 6-7)

**Article 6 - Preamble Language:**

All CTAs must include preamble text stating the treaty's purpose includes:

> "...eliminating double taxation with respect to taxes covered by this agreement **without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements)**..."

**Article 7 - Principal Purpose Test (PPT):**

```
PRINCIPAL PURPOSE TEST (PPT) - Article 7
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE TEST:
Treaty benefit shall NOT be granted if it is reasonable to conclude
that obtaining that benefit was ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSES of
any arrangement or transaction, UNLESS it is established that
granting the benefit would be in accordance with the object and
purpose of the relevant provisions.

KEY ELEMENTS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. "Reasonable to conclude"                                     │
│    → Objective standard (not taxpayer's subjective intent)      │
│                                                                 │
│ 2. "One of the principal purposes"                              │
│    → Does NOT need to be THE principal purpose                  │
│    → Multiple purposes can exist                                │
│                                                                 │
│ 3. "Arrangement or transaction"                                 │
│    → Broad scope - covers structures and dealings               │
│                                                                 │
│ 4. "Object and purpose" exception                               │
│    → Benefit may still be granted if consistent with            │
│      treaty's intended purpose                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Flexibility Options for Article 7:**
- **PPT alone** (default) - most jurisdictions chose this
- **PPT + Simplified LOB** - additional rules-based protection
- **Detailed LOB + anti-conduit rule** - US-style approach (opt-in)

**Exam Tip:** The PPT is **standards-based** (subjective assessment), contrasting with **rules-based** LOB provisions. Most jurisdictions (99 as of April 2022) adopted the PPT to meet the minimum standard.

### 3. MAP Minimum Standard (Article 16)

Article 16 implements Action 14 by ensuring:
- MAP cases are resolved in a **timely manner**
- Competent authorities **endeavour** to resolve disputes
- Implementation of MAP access for treaty-related disputes

---

## E. PART II: HYBRID MISMATCHES (Articles 3-5)

### Overview

Part II addresses situations where hybrid entities or instruments cause mismatches in tax treatment between jurisdictions.

| Article | Subject | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **3** | Transparent entities | Ensures treaty benefits only where income taxed |
| **4** | Dual resident entities | Requires competent authority determination |
| **5** | Application of methods for elimination of double taxation | Addresses exemption method issues |

### Article 3 - Transparent Entities

Addresses situations where an entity is treated as:
- **Transparent** (fiscally ignored) in one jurisdiction
- **Opaque** (separate taxable entity) in another

**Effect:** Income derived through transparent entity is treated as income of resident only to extent that income is treated as the income of a resident for tax purposes.

### Article 4 - Dual Resident Entities

Replaces automatic tie-breaker rules with competent authority procedure:
- Where entity is dual resident, competent authorities must **endeavour to determine** single residence
- If no agreement, entity may be denied treaty benefits (or granted only as agreed)

### Article 5 - Exemption Method Issues

Addresses double non-taxation arising from exemption method by allowing switch to credit method in certain circumstances.

---

## F. PART III: TREATY ABUSE (Articles 6-11)

### Beyond the Minimum Standard

In addition to Articles 6-7 (minimum standard), Part III includes:

| Article | Subject | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **8** | Dividend transfer transactions | Optional |
| **9** | Capital gains from shares in land-rich entities | Optional |
| **10** | Anti-abuse for PEs in third jurisdictions | Optional |
| **11** | Application to own residents (saving clause) | Optional |

### Article 9 - Land-Rich Company Rule

Allows source taxation of gains from shares where:
- Company's value derives principally from immovable property
- Located in source jurisdiction
- At **any time during the 365 days preceding** alienation

This prevents avoidance by temporarily reducing immovable property holdings before sale.

---

## G. PART IV: AVOIDANCE OF PE STATUS (Articles 12-15)

Part IV implements **BEPS Action 7** measures to prevent artificial avoidance of PE status.

### 1. Article 12 - Commissionaire Arrangements

```
COMMISSIONAIRE ARRANGEMENT AVOIDANCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM:
Enterprise uses "commissionaire" to conclude contracts in source state
Commissionaire acts in own name but on behalf of enterprise
Under traditional rules: No PE (contracts not "in the name of" enterprise)

            ┌─────────────────┐
            │  ENTERPRISE     │
            │  (Non-resident) │
            └────────┬────────┘
                     │ Contracts in
                     │ commissionaire's name
                     ▼
            ┌─────────────────┐
            │ COMMISSIONAIRE  │ ← Acts on behalf of enterprise
            │ (Source state)  │   but in OWN name
            └────────┬────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
            ┌─────────────────┐
            │   CUSTOMERS     │
            │ (Source state)  │
            └─────────────────┘

ARTICLE 12 SOLUTION:
PE exists where person "habitually concludes contracts, or habitually
plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts"
that are routinely concluded without material modification

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Article 13 - Anti-Fragmentation Rule

Prevents enterprises from fragmenting cohesive business operations to claim that each fragment is merely "preparatory or auxiliary."

**Example:**
- Warehouse activity alone = preparatory/auxiliary (no PE)
- Delivery activity alone = preparatory/auxiliary (no PE)
- **Combined** with related enterprise activities = may constitute PE

### 3. Article 14 - Splitting-Up of Contracts

Addresses avoidance of construction PE threshold by splitting contracts:
- Single project artificially divided into multiple contracts
- Each under 12-month threshold
- Article 14 aggregates connected contracts for PE determination

### 4. Article 15 - Definition of Connected Persons

Defines when persons are "closely related" for purposes of Articles 12-14.

---

## H. PARTS V AND VI: DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### Part V - Improving Dispute Resolution (Articles 16-17)

| Article | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **16** | MAP access and time limits (minimum standard) |
| **17** | Corresponding adjustments for transfer pricing |

### Part VI - Arbitration (Articles 18-26)

**Optional** mandatory binding arbitration provision:
- Applies if MAP does not resolve case within 2 years
- Arbitration panel issues binding decision
- "Final offer" or "independent opinion" approach

**Adoption:** Limited uptake (~30 jurisdictions opted in)

---

## I. ENTRY INTO FORCE AND APPLICATION

### 1. Entry Into Force

```
MLI ENTRY INTO FORCE TIMELINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FOR THE MLI GENERALLY:
  First day of month following 3 months after 5th ratification
  → 1 July 2018

FOR INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTION:
  First day of month following 3 months after deposit of
  ratification instrument

FOR SPECIFIC CTA:
  Depends on MLI entry into force for BOTH contracting jurisdictions
  AND type of tax:
    • Withholding taxes: Typically from 1 January of following year
    • Other taxes: Taxable periods beginning 6+ months after entry

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Current Status (2025)

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| **Signatories** | 104 jurisdictions |
| **Treaties covered** | ~2,000 modified or pending |
| **Ratifications** | 83+ jurisdictions |

**Notable Non-Signatory:** United States (relies on existing domestic provisions and bilateral negotiations)

---

## J. BENEFITS AND CRITICISMS

### Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Efficiency** | Modifies thousands of treaties without bilateral renegotiation |
| **Speed** | BEPS measures implemented in years, not decades |
| **Consistency** | Standardised provisions across treaty network |
| **Inclusivity** | Non-OECD members participate through Inclusive Framework |
| **Flexibility** | Countries can tailor adoption to their circumstances |

### Criticisms

| Criticism | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Complexity** | Additional legal layer requires extensive analysis |
| **Compliance costs** | Businesses must determine MLI impact on each CTA |
| **Uncertainty** | PPT standards-based approach creates uncertainty |
| **Limited scope** | Distributive articles not modified; allocation unchanged |
| **Incomplete adoption** | US non-participation limits effectiveness |
| **Developing country impact** | May not address core concerns about taxing rights allocation |

### December 2022 Exam Discussion Points

From the December 2022 exam (Q1), key analysis themes included:

1. **Burden reduction**: MLI avoided bilateral renegotiation of each DTA
2. **Certainty for business**: Added complexity vs speed of implementation
3. **Better functioning system**: Too early to assess; depends on revenue outcomes
4. **Citizen benefit**: Inclusive Framework participation; but early movers dominated

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## L. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS FOR EXAM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. WHAT IS THE MLI?
   • Multilateral treaty modifying existing bilateral DTAs
   • Implements BEPS treaty measures (Actions 2, 6, 7, 14)
   • Developed under Action 15
   • 104 signatories; ~2,000 treaties covered

2. HOW IT WORKS:
   • Overlay treaty (does not amend DTA text directly)
   • Applies via VCLT Article 30(3) (later treaty prevails)
   • Both parties must designate DTA as CTA
   • Synthesised texts show combined effect

3. MINIMUM STANDARDS:
   • Treaty abuse: Articles 6-7 (preamble + PPT)
   • Dispute resolution: Article 16 (MAP improvements)
   • ALL signatories must implement (limited reservations)

4. PPT (Article 7):
   • Benefit denied if obtaining benefit was ONE OF principal purposes
   • "Reasonable to conclude" = objective test
   • Exception if granting benefit accords with treaty purpose
   • Standards-based (vs rules-based LOB)

5. PE AVOIDANCE (Articles 12-15):
   • Article 12: Commissionaire arrangements
   • Article 13: Anti-fragmentation rule
   • Article 14: Contract splitting
   • Article 15: Connected persons definition

6. FLEXIBILITY:
   • Opt-in and opt-out provisions
   • Reservations permitted for non-minimum standards
   • Countries notify MLI position at signature/ratification

7. KEY CRITICISMS:
   • Adds complexity (additional legal layer)
   • Compliance costs for businesses and governments
   • PPT uncertainty (standards-based)
   • Does not modify distributive articles (allocation unchanged)
   • US non-participation limits scope

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Saying MLI "amends" DTAs | Incorrect legal mechanism | MLI applies alongside (overlay); does not change DTA text |
| Confusing PPT with LOB | Different anti-abuse mechanisms | PPT = standards-based; LOB = rules-based |
| Forgetting minimum standards | Core exam content | Always mention Articles 6, 7, 16 as minimum standards |
| Ignoring flexibility mechanisms | Incomplete analysis | Explain opt-in, opt-out, reservations, notifications |
| Missing US non-participation | Significant limitation | Note US did not sign; relies on bilateral approach |
| Overlooking synthesised texts | Practical application | Explain how CTAs are read with MLI modifications |
