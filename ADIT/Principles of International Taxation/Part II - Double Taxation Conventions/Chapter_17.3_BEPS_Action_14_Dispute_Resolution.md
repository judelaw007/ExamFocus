## Chapter 17.3: BEPS Action 14 – Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More Effective

### 1. Introduction and Background

#### 1.1. Context Within the BEPS Project

BEPS Action 14 addresses the effectiveness of dispute resolution mechanisms as an integral component of the broader Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The BEPS measures introduced through other Actions—particularly those affecting transfer pricing, permanent establishment definitions, and hybrid arrangements—were expected to generate disputes as countries implemented new rules differently. Without effective dispute resolution, taxpayers would face prolonged uncertainty and potential double taxation, undermining the BEPS project's objectives.

The work on Action 14 recognised that the traditional Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP), while valuable, had significant limitations. Resolution was not guaranteed, timeframes varied widely across jurisdictions, and some countries lacked the resources or commitment to process MAP cases effectively. Action 14 sought to address these weaknesses through a combination of minimum standards, best practices, and peer review mechanisms.

#### 1.2. The 2015 Final Report

The Final Report on Action 14: Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More Effective was adopted in October 2015 as part of the BEPS package endorsed by G20 Finance Ministers. The report established a minimum standard that all Inclusive Framework members commit to implementing, complemented by best practices that jurisdictions are encouraged to adopt.

The report also introduced mandatory binding arbitration as a mechanism to guarantee resolution of treaty-related disputes within a specified timeframe. While arbitration is not part of the minimum standard—recognising that some countries have constitutional or policy objections—a significant group of countries committed to including arbitration provisions in their bilateral tax treaties.

#### 1.3. Policy Rationale

The policy rationale for Action 14 extends beyond administrative efficiency. Effective dispute resolution is essential to maintaining the integrity of the international tax system. When taxpayers cannot obtain relief from double taxation through available mechanisms, the system loses credibility. Businesses may alter their investment patterns to avoid jurisdictions with weak dispute resolution, potentially distorting economic decisions.

Furthermore, the BEPS measures themselves create heightened dispute risk. The implementation of new rules on hybrid mismatches, permanent establishment attribution, and transfer pricing documentation introduces complexity that different jurisdictions may interpret differently. Without robust mechanisms to resolve resulting disputes, the BEPS project risked creating new forms of double taxation while addressing base erosion concerns.

Action 14 thus serves a dual purpose: improving the functioning of existing dispute resolution mechanisms and ensuring that the international tax system can accommodate the additional complexity introduced by other BEPS Actions.

### 2. The Minimum Standard

#### 2.1. Structure: 21 Elements and 12 Best Practices

The Action 14 minimum standard was translated into detailed Terms of Reference in October 2016. The Terms of Reference break down the minimum standard into 21 elements that form the basis for peer review assessment. These elements address both the legal framework for MAP and its practical application. *(covered in December 2023)*

The minimum standard is complemented by 12 best practices. Unlike the 21 elements, best practices are not mandatory and do not affect a jurisdiction's assessment against the minimum standard. However, jurisdictions may voluntarily identify best practices they have adopted and request peer feedback on their implementation.

This structure provides flexibility while establishing clear baseline expectations. All Inclusive Framework members must meet the 21 elements, while the 12 best practices allow jurisdictions to demonstrate additional commitment to effective dispute resolution.

#### 2.2. The Four Key Areas

The 21 elements of the minimum standard address four key areas of effective dispute resolution:

**Preventing Disputes**: The first area focuses on preventing treaty-related disputes from arising in the first place. This includes ensuring that tax treaties are interpreted and applied consistently with their terms and the parties' intentions. Measures in this area address the need for clear guidance, trained personnel, and coordination between treaty interpretation and domestic law application.

**Availability and Access to MAP**: The second area ensures that taxpayers who meet the requirements of Article 25(1) can access the MAP. Jurisdictions must not impose unjustified barriers to MAP access, such as unreasonable documentation requirements or procedural obstacles. Access should be available for all cases where the taxpayer has a valid claim that treaty provisions have not been correctly applied.

**Resolution of MAP Cases**: The third area addresses the actual resolution of MAP cases. Jurisdictions must commit to resolving cases in a timely manner, with a target average timeframe of 24 months. This requires adequate resourcing of competent authority functions, effective case management procedures, and willingness to engage constructively with treaty partners.

**Implementation of MAP Agreements**: The fourth area ensures that MAP agreements, once reached, are actually implemented. This includes mechanisms to give effect to agreements even where domestic time limits might otherwise prevent adjustment, and processes to ensure that taxpayers receive the relief contemplated by the agreement.

### 3. Peer Review Process

#### 3.1. Stage 1 and Stage 2 Reviews

The peer review process established under Action 14 consists of two stages. Stage 1 involves a comprehensive review of how an Inclusive Framework member implements the minimum standard, examining both the legal framework for MAP and its application in practice. The review considers the jurisdiction's tax treaties, domestic legislation, published guidance, and statistical data on MAP cases.

Stage 1 reviews result in specific recommendations where jurisdictions need to improve to achieve full compliance with the minimum standard. These recommendations identify deficiencies in the legal framework, practical application, or both.

Stage 2 involves monitoring the follow-up to Stage 1 recommendations. Jurisdictions are assessed on the measures they have taken to address identified shortcomings. Stage 2 reports document progress and identify any remaining areas requiring attention.

The initial peer review process, launched at the end of 2016, covered 82 jurisdictions through both Stage 1 and Stage 2 reviews. This comprehensive exercise provided unprecedented transparency into MAP practices globally and drove significant improvements in dispute resolution effectiveness.

#### 3.2. Continued Monitoring (Post-2022)

Following the completion of the initial peer review process in 2022, the Inclusive Framework agreed on a new methodology for continued monitoring. The revised approach, adopted in December 2022, recognises that jurisdictions have varying levels of MAP experience and tailors the review process accordingly. *(covered in June 2024)*

Jurisdictions with "meaningful MAP experience"—those handling significant volumes of MAP cases—undergo a full peer review process every four years beginning in 2024. This comprehensive review assesses continued compliance with the minimum standard and identifies any new areas for improvement.

Jurisdictions without meaningful MAP experience may opt for a simplified peer review process. The simplified process, available from 2023, focuses on the jurisdiction's treaty network, MAP profile, published guidance, and compliance with reporting requirements. This approach supports smaller or less experienced jurisdictions in developing robust MAP programmes without imposing disproportionate review burdens.

### 4. Key Commitments

#### 4.1. 24-Month Resolution Timeframe

A central commitment under Action 14 is the target to resolve MAP cases within an average timeframe of 24 months. This target addresses the historical criticism that MAP cases could remain unresolved for years or even decades, providing little practical relief to affected taxpayers.

The 24-month target applies to the average resolution time across a jurisdiction's MAP caseload, recognising that individual cases may take longer depending on their complexity. Jurisdictions report their average resolution times as part of the MAP Statistics Reporting Framework, enabling comparison across countries and over time.

Achieving the 24-month target requires adequate resourcing of competent authority functions, efficient case management processes, and constructive engagement with treaty partners. Many jurisdictions have invested significantly in building capacity and improving procedures to meet this commitment.

#### 4.2. MAP Statistics Reporting

The minimum standard includes a commitment to provide timely and complete reporting of MAP statistics according to an agreed framework. The MAP Statistics Reporting Framework, implemented from 2016, requires jurisdictions to report annually on their MAP case inventory, including cases opened, closed, and pending, as well as the types of issues involved and resolution timeframes.

Published MAP statistics provide transparency into the functioning of dispute resolution mechanisms globally. Taxpayers and advisers can assess which jurisdictions are effective at processing MAP cases and which may present challenges. This transparency creates accountability and incentivises improvement.

The reporting framework was enhanced in 2023 with additional data points to provide more granular information on MAP performance. A new framework for Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) statistics was also introduced, extending transparency to preventive mechanisms.

### 5. Implementation and Outcomes

#### 5.1. Progress Achieved

The Action 14 peer review process has driven substantial improvements in MAP effectiveness. Many jurisdictions have updated their legal frameworks to ensure compliance with the minimum standard, published MAP guidance for taxpayers, and invested in competent authority resources.

Statistical evidence demonstrates progress. The average time to close MAP cases has decreased in most jurisdictions since the peer review process began. A majority of reviewed jurisdictions now meet or approach the 24-month target resolution timeframe. The inventory of pending cases, while still significant, is being processed more efficiently.

The transparency created by published peer review reports has generated constructive pressure for improvement. Jurisdictions identified as deficient in Stage 1 reviews have generally taken steps to address recommendations, as documented in Stage 2 follow-up reports.

#### 5.2. Remaining Challenges

Despite progress, challenges remain. Not all jurisdictions have fully implemented the minimum standard, and some continue to face difficulties meeting the 24-month resolution target. Resource constraints, particularly in developing countries, limit competent authority capacity. Complex cases involving multiple jurisdictions or novel issues may exceed target timeframes.

The interaction between MAP and domestic litigation presents ongoing complications. Where taxpayers pursue parallel domestic proceedings, competent authorities may be constrained in their ability to reach mutual agreement, and domestic court decisions may limit the scope for bilateral resolution.

#### 5.3. Relationship with Arbitration

While arbitration is not part of the minimum standard, it remains an important complement to improved MAP processes. Countries that have adopted mandatory binding arbitration through Article 25(5) or the MLI provide a guaranteed backstop for cases that cannot be resolved through the MAP alone.

The combination of improved MAP procedures under Action 14 and arbitration availability creates a comprehensive dispute resolution framework. Effective MAP reduces the need for arbitration by resolving most cases bilaterally, while arbitration ensures resolution in the minority of cases where competent authorities cannot agree.

The continued development of dispute resolution mechanisms reflects the BEPS project's recognition that effective remedies are essential to the legitimacy of international tax rules. Without reliable dispute resolution, the risk of unrelieved double taxation would undermine confidence in the international tax system.

#### 5.4. Future Developments

The Action 14 framework continues to evolve. The revised assessment methodology adopted in 2022 reflects lessons learned from the initial peer review round. The introduction of simplified reviews for jurisdictions without meaningful MAP experience recognises the diverse circumstances of Inclusive Framework members while maintaining pressure for improvement.

Looking forward, the interaction between Action 14 and the Pillar One and Pillar Two frameworks under the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework will require attention. The new rules on profit allocation and minimum taxation may generate disputes that existing MAP mechanisms must accommodate. Ensuring that dispute resolution capacity keeps pace with the expanding scope of international tax coordination remains an ongoing challenge.

The success of Action 14 demonstrates that multilateral commitment to minimum standards, combined with transparent peer review, can drive meaningful improvements in international tax administration. This model may inform future initiatives addressing other aspects of tax certainty and cooperation.
