# Chapter 5.5: Resolving Interpretation Issues by Competent Authority Proceedings

## 1. Article 25(3): The Interpretation Resolution Mechanism

Article 25(3) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides a procedural mechanism for resolving interpretation difficulties that arise under double taxation conventions. This provision is distinct from Articles 25(1) and (2), which address individual taxpayer relief through the mutual agreement procedure (MAP). Article 25(3) addresses general interpretation issues affecting all taxpayers.

The provision states: "The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention."

### 1.1. The Two Limbs of Article 25(3)

Article 25(3) contains two distinct functions. The first limb addresses interpretation and application difficulties: competent authorities "shall endeavour" to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. This obligation is mandatory in terms of effort, though there is no obligation to reach agreement. The scope covers both interpretation and application issues, and the trigger is any difficulties or doubts that arise. This limb addresses general issues affecting categories of taxpayers, not merely specific cases.

The second limb addresses cases not provided for in the Convention. Competent authorities "may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention." This is permissive rather than mandatory—competent authorities "may" consult at their discretion. The scope is gap-filling for situations not covered by the treaty, with the purpose of eliminating double taxation that falls outside the treaty's provisions.

## 2. Position in the Interpretation Framework

Article 25(3) operates as a procedural mechanism within the broader treaty interpretation framework established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) and the specific rules of tax treaty interpretation.

### 2.1. The Critical Link to Article 3(2)

Article 3(2) of the OECD Model explicitly references competent authority agreement as an alternative to domestic law reference for undefined terms. The 2017 Update to the OECD Model included pivotal changes to Article 3(2) stemming from BEPS Action 14 recommendations, intended to remove any doubt that when competent authorities agree on a common meaning of an undefined term, the domestic law meaning would not be applicable.

Article 3(2) provides that any term not defined in the treaty shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the competent authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 25, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies.

This creates a direct interpretive pathway with three possible outcomes. First, the context may require an autonomous meaning derived from the treaty itself. Second, competent authority agreement under Article 25 may establish a uniform agreed meaning. Third, absent either of these, reference to domestic law provides each State's meaning, potentially resulting in divergent interpretations.

The critical point is that competent authority agreement under Article 25(3) takes priority over domestic law reference. It provides uniform interpretation for both Contracting States, avoiding the problem of divergent meanings that can arise from domestic law reference. *(examined in June 2024)*

### 2.2. Status Under the Vienna Convention

Competent authority agreements under Article 25(3) constitute "subsequent agreement" under VCLT Article 31(3)(a), which provides that there shall be taken into account, together with the context, any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions.

This classification means that competent authority interpretive agreements form part of the context for interpretation under the general rule in VCLT Article 31. They must be taken into account by both States when interpreting treaty provisions, and they carry significant legal weight in the interpretation hierarchy. The International Law Commission's 2018 Draft Conclusions on Subsequent Agreements and Subsequent Practice confirm that such agreements are given significant, even dispositive weight, as they clearly demonstrate the parties' contemporaneous understanding of treaty meaning.

However, the precise legal status of competent authority agreements as "subsequent agreements" under Article 31(3)(a) remains debated in international tax law. Their interpretive authority depends on whether they meet the criteria for constituting an agreement "regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions" between treaty parties. Constitutional concerns also arise regarding whether such agreements constitute treaty amendment requiring parliamentary approval.

## 3. Scope of Article 25(3) Interpretation

### 3.1. Matters Within Competent Authority Authority

Competent authorities may agree on the meaning of undefined terms, creating the link to Article 3(2). They may address classification of income under distributive articles where ambiguity exists, application of anti-abuse provisions such as the principal purpose test, and procedural matters for applying treaty relief. Resolution of ambiguous provisions, attribution of profits to permanent establishments under Article 7, dual residence determination procedures under Article 4(3), and treatment of hybrid instruments and entities all fall within the scope of Article 25(3).

The OECD Commentary on Article 25, paragraph 56, confirms that competent authorities are empowered to settle interpretation questions of a general nature, irrespective of specific cases that may arise. Paragraph 57 further provides that such interpretations, because they are agreed upon between the two States, form part of the meaning of the Convention.

### 3.2. Limits on Competent Authority Authority

Competent authorities may not contradict clear treaty text or override express treaty provisions. They cannot amend the treaty, as this requires formal amendment procedures. They may not grant benefits beyond the treaty's scope or impose obligations not found in the treaty. The distinction between interpretation and amendment is crucial—Article 31(3)(a) VCLT does not cover modification, only interpretation.

### 3.3. Practical Examples

Practical applications of Article 25(3) include competent authority agreement on the meaning and application criteria for "beneficial owner" in Articles 10, 11, and 12. Competent authorities have agreed on classification of hybrid instruments as debt or equity for treaty purposes. Interpretation of "fixed place of business" for permanent establishment threshold determinations and characterisation of service fees as royalties, business profits, or other income have been resolved through this mechanism. Procedures for Article 4(3) dual resident entity determinations and methods for profit allocation to permanent establishments are also established through competent authority agreement.

## 4. Procedure and Implementation

### 4.1. How Article 25(3) Operates

The procedure begins with identification of an interpretation difficulty or doubt. This may emerge from specific cases or from general administrative practice, and either competent authority may initiate the process.

Competent authority consultation follows, involving direct communication between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. Article 25(4) permits direct communication without going through diplomatic channels. There is no requirement for taxpayer involvement at this stage.

If mutual agreement is reached, the competent authorities create a binding interpretation for both States. The "endeavour" standard means competent authorities must make a good faith effort to agree, but there is no obligation to reach agreement.

Implementation may take various forms. Many countries publish competent authority agreements as guidance, and administrative practice is updated accordingly. The agreement typically applies prospectively, though some may have retrospective effect depending on their terms.

### 4.2. Forms of Competent Authority Agreements

Competent authority interpretive agreements may take various forms with differing binding effects. Exchange of letters between competent authorities constitutes formal correspondence that is binding on both tax authorities. Published memoranda provide joint interpretive guidance with administrative binding effect. Unpublished agreements create internal administrative agreements that are binding but lack transparency. Protocol amendments, while technically formal additions to the treaty rather than mere agreements, are legally binding in the fullest sense.

BEPS Action 14 encourages publication of competent authority agreements to improve transparency. The October 2024 update to the OECD Manual on Effective MAP (MEMAP) provides comprehensive guidance on competent authority agreements and the MAP process.

## 5. Distinction from Individual Relief

Article 25(3) must be distinguished from Articles 25(1) and (2), which provide individual taxpayer relief through MAP.

The trigger differs fundamentally. For Articles 25(1)-(2), a taxpayer must request relief based on taxation not in accordance with the Convention. For Article 25(3), the competent authorities initiate the process based on interpretation difficulties arising from their administrative practice or from patterns emerging across multiple cases.

The scope also differs. Articles 25(1)-(2) address specific cases affecting individual taxpayers, while Article 25(3) addresses general interpretation issues affecting all taxpayers falling within the scope of the interpretation difficulty.

Time limits apply differently. A three-year time limit from first notification applies to individual MAP requests under Article 25(1), but there is no time limit for Article 25(3) interpretation issues.

The focus differs as well. Individual MAP focuses on taxation not in accordance with the Convention, seeking remedial relief for the affected taxpayer. Article 25(3) focuses on interpretation difficulties and doubts, providing interpretive and preventive resolution.

Finally, the beneficiary differs. Individual MAP benefits the specific taxpayer who requested relief. Article 25(3) interpretive agreements benefit all affected taxpayers falling within the scope of the agreed interpretation. *(examined in December 2023)*

## 6. Limitations and Challenges

### 6.1. The "Endeavour" Standard

Article 25(3) requires competent authorities to "endeavour" to resolve interpretation issues. This means competent authorities must make a good faith effort to agree, but there is no obligation to reach agreement. If competent authorities cannot agree, the interpretation difficulty remains unresolved.

The consequences of non-agreement are significant. Divergent interpretations may persist between the Contracting States. Taxpayers face uncertainty in applying treaty provisions. Potential double taxation or double non-taxation may result. Domestic courts must resolve disputes without the benefit of competent authority guidance.

### 6.2. Binding Effect Questions

The binding effect of competent authority agreements raises several questions. Such agreements are binding on tax authorities as administrative guidance. They are generally binding on taxpayers, though taxpayers retain the right to challenge administrative guidance in domestic courts. Courts treat competent authority agreements as persuasive but retain ultimate interpretive authority. Whether agreements have retrospective effect depends on their terms; they are generally prospective.

### 6.3. Transparency Concerns

Competent authority agreements under Article 25(3) may be published, providing certainty but occurring rarely in practice. More commonly, agreements are unpublished, which creates transparency issues for taxpayers seeking to understand how treaty provisions will be applied. Some agreements remain informal, providing practical resolution but potentially lacking legal clarity.

## 7. The Second Limb: Cases Not Provided For

### 7.1. Gap-Filling Function

The second sentence of Article 25(3) permits competent authorities to address situations not covered by the Convention. This gap-filling function is permissive rather than mandatory—competent authorities "may" consult rather than "shall endeavour."

Key distinctions from the first limb include the permissive nature of the second limb, its focus on gap-filling beyond existing provisions rather than interpretation of existing provisions, its purpose of eliminating double taxation rather than resolving difficulties, and its operation beyond rather than within the treaty's existing scope.

### 7.2. Examples of Gap-Filling

Gap-filling applications include new types of income not anticipated when the original treaty was concluded, new business models such as those in the digital economy, triangular cases involving third States not addressed by the bilateral treaty, and treaty interaction with domestic anti-avoidance rules.

### 7.3. Limits on Gap-Filling

Competent authorities cannot use the second limb to create new taxing rights not contemplated by the treaty, impose new obligations on taxpayers beyond those in the treaty, contradict express treaty provisions, or exceed their delegated authority under domestic law. The gap-filling function remains subordinate to the treaty text.

## 8. Integration with Other Interpretation Topics

Article 25(3) integrates with the broader interpretation framework covered in other sections of this chapter series.

Within the general approach to interpretation, Article 25(3) provides the procedural mechanism for competent authority resolution of difficulties. The Vienna Convention classification means competent authority agreements constitute subsequent agreement under VCLT Article 31(3)(a). The relationship with OECD Commentaries means competent authority agreements may reflect Commentary guidance or may diverge from it in specific bilateral contexts. The Article 3(2) link is fundamental—Article 25(3) provides the mechanism for competent authority agreement referenced in Article 3(2) as an alternative to domestic law reference.

Beyond interpretation, Article 25(3) connects to Article 4(3) dual residence determinations, where competent authorities determine residence of dual-resident entities. Transfer pricing under Article 9 involves competent authority agreement on arm's length principle application. Anti-abuse provisions require competent authority consultation on application of the principal purpose test and limitation on benefits provisions. MLI implementation involves competent authority consultations on interpretation of provisions modified by the Multilateral Instrument.

## 9. Recent Developments

### 9.1. BEPS Action 14 Implementation

BEPS Action 14 focuses on making dispute resolution mechanisms more effective. The OECD Inclusive Framework conducts peer reviews assessing implementation of the Action 14 minimum standard. As of June 2025, the OECD released 36 new peer review results, with full peer reviews now conducted once every four years for jurisdictions with meaningful MAP experience. *(covered in June 2023)*

Key achievements include signing and ratification of the Multilateral Instrument to align treaties with the Action 14 minimum standard, issuance of MAP guidance by all jurisdictions, and improved resources in competent authorities to meet the 24-month targeted average for case resolution.

### 9.2. MAP Statistics

The 2024 MAP statistics released by the OECD demonstrate improved effectiveness. Seventy-six percent of MAP cases reached full resolution, up from 74% in 2023. Only 4% of cases closed without agreement. Average resolution time was 27.4 months, with transfer pricing cases averaging 30.9 months and other cases 24.5 months.

### 9.3. UN Model Developments

The UN Model Tax Convention 2025 introduced significant changes to Article 25. A new clause in Article 25(6) elevates the GATS clause from Commentary to the model itself. A new ISDS override clause was approved in March 2025, designed to switch off investor-state dispute settlement in tax-related disputes. This clause has no counterpart in the OECD Model and represents a significant divergence reflecting developing country concerns.

### 9.4. 2025 OECD Commentary Updates

The 2025 Update to the OECD Model Tax Convention includes Article 25 Commentary expansions. Clarification is provided on when taxpayers can initiate MAP, confirming that taxpayers can access MAP when taxation not in accordance with the Convention is probable rather than actual. This includes situations where domestic law changes would clearly create treaty conflict, where self-assessment requirements force a reporting position inconsistent with treaty treatment, and where transfer pricing law requires reporting higher taxable income than actual transaction prices.

Pillar One integration means Commentary changes related to Amount B ensure optionality is preserved in dispute resolution mechanisms for non-adopting jurisdictions.

## 10. Practical Considerations for Treaty Application

### 10.1. When to Consider Competent Authority Resolution

Practitioners and taxpayers should consider competent authority resolution under Article 25(3) when facing interpretation questions that affect multiple transactions or tax periods rather than isolated cases. Where domestic law reference under Article 3(2) would produce divergent meanings in the two Contracting States, competent authority agreement offers the only path to uniform interpretation. Similarly, where existing Commentary guidance is unclear or where bilateral treaty language departs from the OECD Model, competent authority consultation may clarify the agreed meaning.

The decision whether to pursue individual MAP under Articles 25(1)-(2) or to advocate for general interpretation guidance under Article 25(3) depends on the nature of the issue. If the difficulty affects only a specific transaction, individual MAP is appropriate. If the interpretation question will recur across multiple taxpayers and transactions, Article 25(3) interpretation may provide more comprehensive resolution.

### 10.2. Relationship Between Individual MAP and Interpretive Agreements

Individual MAP cases under Articles 25(1)-(2) may reveal interpretation difficulties that warrant general resolution under Article 25(3). When competent authorities observe that similar issues arise repeatedly in individual cases, they may choose to resolve the underlying interpretation question once through Article 25(3) rather than repeatedly in individual proceedings.

Conversely, existing Article 25(3) interpretive agreements inform the resolution of individual MAP cases. Where competent authorities have previously agreed on the meaning of a treaty term, that agreement applies to individual cases involving the same term.

### 10.3. Constitutional and Domestic Law Considerations

The authority of competent authorities to conclude interpretive agreements depends on their delegated powers under domestic law. In some jurisdictions, competent authority agreements may require approval from legislative bodies or may be subject to judicial review. Constitutional questions arise particularly where competent authority agreements are perceived to modify rather than merely interpret treaty provisions.

The relationship between competent authority agreements and domestic administrative law also varies by jurisdiction. In some States, competent authority agreements create binding administrative guidance that tax authorities must follow. In others, such agreements may have only persuasive effect, leaving room for tax authority discretion in individual cases.

### 10.4. The Role of Taxpayer Input

Although Article 25(3) operates between competent authorities without formal taxpayer involvement, taxpayers may indirectly influence the process. Industry associations and professional bodies may raise interpretation issues with revenue authorities, prompting competent authority consultation. Patterns emerging from tax audits may alert competent authorities to interpretation difficulties requiring resolution. Public consultation processes, where available, may allow taxpayer input before competent authority agreements are finalised.

The transparency of competent authority agreements affects taxpayer planning. Published agreements provide certainty for transactions falling within their scope. Unpublished agreements create risk for taxpayers who may unknowingly take positions inconsistent with competent authority understandings.
