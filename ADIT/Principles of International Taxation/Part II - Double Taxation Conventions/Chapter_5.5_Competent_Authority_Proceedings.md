# Chapter 5.5: Resolving Interpretation Issues by Competent Authority Proceedings

## 1. Introduction: The Interpretive Resolution Mechanism

### 1.1. Article 25(3) Framework

Article 25(3) of the OECD Model provides a distinctive mechanism for resolving interpretation difficulties that arise under double taxation conventions. While Articles 25(1) and 25(2) address individual taxpayer relief from taxation not in accordance with treaty provisions, Article 25(3) serves a broader interpretive function—enabling competent authorities to resolve general difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the convention.

The provision states that competent authorities "shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention." A second sentence adds that they "may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention." These two sentences establish distinct functions: mandatory engagement on interpretation issues and permissive consultation on gap-filling.

This interpretive mechanism complements the broader treaty interpretation framework. Where VCLT principles, OECD Commentary, and domestic law reference under Article 3(2) may yield uncertain or divergent results, Article 25(3) provides a procedural pathway for the contracting states to achieve uniform interpretation through competent authority agreement.

### 1.2. Distinction from Individual Relief

Article 25(3) differs fundamentally from the individual taxpayer relief provisions in Articles 25(1) and 25(2). Individual relief requires a taxpayer to present a case to a competent authority within specified time limits, addressing specific taxation alleged to be inconsistent with treaty provisions. Article 25(3) addresses general interpretation issues affecting categories of taxpayers or the treaty's overall application, without requiring individual taxpayer initiation or adherence to time limits.

The distinction matters for understanding the scope and operation of competent authority proceedings. Individual relief focuses on remedying specific instances of improper taxation. Interpretive proceedings under Article 25(3) focus on clarifying treaty meaning prospectively, benefiting all affected taxpayers and preventing future disputes.

## 2. The Two Limbs of Article 25(3)

### 2.1. First Limb: Interpretation and Application

The first sentence of Article 25(3) addresses resolution of "difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention." This language encompasses both textual interpretation—what treaty provisions mean—and practical application—how those provisions operate in specific circumstances.

The mandatory character of this limb appears in the phrase "shall endeavour." Competent authorities must make genuine efforts to resolve interpretation difficulties when they arise. The OECD Manual on Effective Mutual Agreement Procedures, updated in October 2024, emphasises that competent authorities should not remain passive or adversarial but must engage constructively in seeking agreement. Positions taken must be consistent and reciprocal—an authority cannot adopt interpretations favouring its revenue interests when acting as residence state while rejecting those same interpretations when acting as source state.

However, "endeavour" falls short of absolute obligation. Competent authorities must try to agree but are not obligated to reach agreement. Where genuine disagreement persists despite good faith efforts, the interpretation difficulty remains unresolved—leaving taxpayers facing continued uncertainty and potentially divergent treatment across the contracting states.

### 2.2. Second Limb: Cases Not Provided For

The second sentence authorises competent authorities to "consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention." This gap-filling function addresses situations where double taxation occurs but the treaty contains no applicable provision.

The permissive character of this limb appears in "may also consult"—discretionary rather than mandatory. Competent authorities have latitude to address novel situations, emerging business models, or cross-border arrangements not anticipated when the treaty was negotiated. Examples include triangular cases involving third-country permanent establishments, new types of digital income, and interactions between treaty provisions and subsequently enacted domestic anti-avoidance rules.

This gap-filling authority has limits. Competent authorities cannot create new taxing rights absent from the treaty, impose new obligations on taxpayers, or contradict express treaty provisions. The function remains consultative and interpretive rather than legislative—extending treaty logic to unforeseen situations rather than amending treaty terms (covered in December 2024).

## 3. Position in the Interpretation Hierarchy

### 3.1. Link to Article 3(2)

Article 25(3) connects directly to Article 3(2), which governs interpretation of terms not defined in the treaty. Article 3(2) provides that undefined terms shall have the meaning under domestic law "unless the context otherwise requires or the competent authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 25."

This explicit reference establishes Article 25(3) as an interpretive pathway alternative to domestic law reference. Where undefined terms might receive divergent meanings under each contracting state's domestic law, competent authority agreement provides uniform interpretation binding on both states' tax administrations. The agreement takes priority over domestic law reference—if competent authorities agree on meaning, that agreed meaning applies regardless of what domestic law would otherwise provide.

The interpretive hierarchy thus operates as follows: treaty text and context come first under VCLT Article 31. Where terms remain undefined, context may require autonomous interpretation. Absent contextual direction, competent authorities may agree on meaning under Article 25. Only failing such agreement does domestic law reference under Article 3(2) apply as the residual rule.

### 3.2. Status Under VCLT

Competent authority agreements under Article 25(3) constitute "subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty" under VCLT Article 31(3)(a). The VCLT requires that such subsequent agreements "shall be taken into account, together with the context" when interpreting treaty provisions.

This status has significant consequences. Competent authority interpretive agreements form part of the interpretive context that tribunals and courts must consider when applying treaty provisions. They represent the contracting states' shared understanding of treaty meaning, expressed through the officials authorised to administer treaty provisions. While courts retain ultimate interpretive authority and may decline to follow competent authority positions they consider erroneous, the VCLT status means such positions carry substantial weight in the interpretation hierarchy.

The OECD Commentary on Article 25, paragraph 57, confirms that interpretations agreed between competent authorities "form part of the meaning of the Convention" for purposes of both states' application. This reflects the treaty parties' intention that competent authority agreement should provide authoritative guidance on treaty meaning.

## 4. Scope of Interpretive Authority

### 4.1. Matters Within CA Competence

Competent authorities may address a wide range of interpretation and application issues under Article 25(3). Common subjects include the meaning of undefined terms such as "beneficial owner," classification of income under distributive articles, application of anti-abuse provisions including the principal purpose test, procedural matters for treaty relief claims, and attribution of profits to permanent establishments.

Specific examples illustrate the breadth of competent authority interpretive work. Hybrid instruments that characterise differently under each state's domestic law—as debt in one and equity in the other—may require competent authority agreement on treaty classification. Service fee payments that could constitute royalties, technical service fees, or ordinary business profits depending on interpretation may require resolution. Dual residence determinations under Article 4(3) for entities resident in both states require competent authority agreement on which state has residence for treaty purposes.

The 2024 OECD release of a Model Competent Authority Agreement for Pillar One Amount B demonstrates evolution toward more structured interpretive frameworks. This model agreement assists jurisdictions implementing simplified transfer pricing approaches, providing template language for competent authority coordination on methodological questions (covered in June 2024).

### 4.2. Limits on CA Authority

Competent authorities cannot exceed their delegated authority or contradict clear treaty text. The interpretive function operates within, not beyond, the treaty framework. Agreements purporting to amend treaty provisions, grant benefits the treaty does not provide, or create obligations the treaty does not impose would exceed competent authority mandate.

Courts have occasionally declined to follow competent authority interpretations considered inconsistent with treaty text. The relationship between administrative agreement and judicial interpretation remains nuanced—competent authority positions carry significant weight but do not conclusively determine treaty meaning where courts conclude the text compels different reading.

Domestic law constraints may further limit competent authority freedom. Each competent authority can only agree to interpretations consistent with its domestic constitutional and legislative framework. An interpretation requiring action beyond competent authority powers under domestic law cannot be implemented regardless of bilateral agreement.

## 5. Procedure and Implementation

### 5.1. Forms of CA Agreements

Competent authority interpretive agreements take various forms depending on subject matter and administrative practice. Formal exchange of letters between competent authorities provides documented agreement suitable for significant interpretive positions. Published memoranda of understanding establish joint guidance accessible to taxpayers and advisers. Protocol amendments to treaties, while requiring more formal procedures, provide legally binding clarification.

Less formal arrangements also occur. Unpublished administrative agreements guide internal tax authority practice without public disclosure. Direct communications between competent authority officials may establish working understandings applied in case handling. The BEPS Action 14 transparency initiatives encourage publication of competent authority agreements, but practice varies significantly across jurisdictions.

Canada, for example, publishes competent authority agreements and notices on its official website, covering interpretive positions reached with treaty partners including the United States, Belgium, China, Netherlands, and Norway. These published agreements address matters including withholding tax treatment, business profit attribution, and interest classification—demonstrating the practical scope of Article 25(3) application.

### 5.2. Binding Effect

Competent authority agreements bind tax administrations in both contracting states. Administrative officials must apply the agreed interpretation when handling taxpayer cases. This administrative binding effect provides practical certainty—taxpayers can rely on published competent authority positions as representing the official view of both treaty partners.

The binding effect on courts is more limited. Courts retain interpretive authority under their domestic constitutional frameworks and may reach conclusions differing from competent authority positions. However, the VCLT status of competent authority agreements as subsequent agreement means courts must take such positions into account, and significant weight typically attaches to the treaty parties' expressed understanding of their agreement.

Binding effect on taxpayers operates through administrative application. Taxpayers cannot compel competent authorities to adopt particular interpretations, but they benefit from (and are subject to) the interpretations actually adopted. Where taxpayers disagree with competent authority positions, domestic procedures for challenging administrative determinations remain available.

## 6. BEPS Action 14 and MAP Effectiveness

### 6.1. Minimum Standards

BEPS Action 14 established minimum standards for effective mutual agreement procedures, directly affecting competent authority interpretation work. The minimum standard requires that countries resolve MAP cases in a timely manner, with a target average of twenty-four months for case resolution. Countries must also provide clear MAP guidance, maintain adequate competent authority resources, and publish MAP profiles describing their procedures.

The October 2024 OECD Manual on Effective Mutual Agreement Procedures consolidates operational guidance for competent authorities. It emphasises that authorities must engage constructively rather than passively, maintain consistent positions regardless of which state's revenue is affected, and work toward resolution within reasonable timeframes. These behavioural standards apply to interpretation proceedings under Article 25(3) as much as to individual relief cases.

Implementation monitoring occurs through peer review. The revised methodology effective from January 2024 distinguishes jurisdictions with "meaningful MAP experience"—defined as ten or more MAP cases in end inventory averaged over three years—from those without. Jurisdictions with meaningful experience undergo full peer review every four years; others receive simplified review focusing on framework adequacy rather than case-handling outcomes.

### 6.2. Peer Review and Statistics

The June 2025 peer review results released by the OECD Inclusive Framework demonstrate ongoing implementation progress. Thirty-six new peer review reports covered jurisdictions including Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Estonia, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom in the first batch of full reviews under the new methodology. All reviewed jurisdictions showed efforts to close cases within or closer to the twenty-four month target.

The 2024 MAP statistics published in October 2025 provide comprehensive data on competent authority performance. Resolution times averaged 27.4 months overall—above the twenty-four month target but reflecting improvement from prior years. Transfer pricing cases averaged 30.9 months, while other cases averaged 24.5 months. The resolution rate reached seventy-six percent, up from seventy-four percent in 2023, with only four percent of cases closed without agreement (covered in December 2023).

Case inventory data shows encouraging trends. Fewer than 3.3 percent of cases predate 2016, and fewer than twenty percent are older than four years. Over fifty-six percent of the current inventory is under two years old, suggesting improved case management and faster resolution. These statistics reflect competent authority performance across all MAP functions including interpretation proceedings.

## 7. Mandatory Binding Arbitration

### 7.1. MLI Part VI Framework

The Multilateral Instrument Part VI introduces mandatory binding arbitration as a backstop for unresolved MAP cases. Where competent authorities cannot reach agreement within specified timeframes—typically two to three years—taxpayers may trigger arbitration to obtain binding resolution. This mechanism ensures that interpretation disputes do not remain indefinitely unresolved due to competent authority disagreement.

Part VI operates only between jurisdictions that affirmatively opt in. Each country choosing to participate designates its arbitration preferences through reservations and notifications. The arbitration obligation applies only to treaty relationships where both partners have opted into Part VI and their respective reservations permit coverage of the case type at issue.

Adoption remains partial. Major jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Netherlands, and Australia have opted into Part VI. India has explicitly declined mandatory arbitration, consistent with its emphasis on preserving sovereign discretion in tax matters. The United States, not being an MLI signatory, addresses arbitration through bilateral treaty provisions rather than the multilateral framework.

### 7.2. Arbitration Types

Two arbitration approaches operate under Part VI. The default "final offer" approach—sometimes called baseball arbitration—requires each competent authority to submit a proposed resolution, with the arbitration panel choosing one or the other without modification. This approach encourages reasonable positions by creating risk that extreme positions will be rejected in favour of the opposing proposal.

The alternative independent opinion approach permits arbitration panels to determine the appropriate resolution without being bound to either competent authority's position. Countries may choose this approach through reservation. The Netherlands applies final offer arbitration generally but has agreed to independent opinion arbitration with specific partners including Japan and Malta.

For interpretation disputes, arbitration provides ultimate resolution where competent authorities cannot agree. The arbitration decision binds both competent authorities, conclusively determining the interpretation or application issue. This binding character distinguishes arbitration from the "endeavour" obligation in Article 25(3)—arbitration produces definitive outcome regardless of competent authority preferences.

## 8. UN Model Considerations

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention contains Article 25 provisions paralleling the OECD Model but reflecting developing country perspectives. The UN Model emphasises source-based taxation more strongly than the OECD Model, affecting how competent authority interpretive positions may develop under UN-based treaties.

The UN Model does not include mandatory arbitration as a default. It offers alternative approaches: optional arbitration after three years or no arbitration provision at all. This flexibility reflects developing country concerns about mandatory arbitration processes that may favour jurisdictions with greater resources and expertise in international tax disputes.

The UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters has developed guidance supporting developing country competent authorities. The UN Handbook on Avoidance and Resolution of Tax Disputes incorporates practical guidance for jurisdictions with limited MAP experience. The December 2024 UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, established by General Assembly Resolution 79/235, includes protocols addressing prevention and resolution of tax disputes—potentially providing alternative frameworks for competent authority coordination outside the OECD system.

## 9. Practical Limitations

Despite its central role in the interpretation framework, Article 25(3) faces practical limitations. The "endeavour" obligation does not guarantee resolution. Where competent authorities hold genuinely incompatible positions—whether from different legal traditions, conflicting domestic law constraints, or simple disagreement on treaty meaning—interpretation difficulties may persist indefinitely. Taxpayers caught between divergent interpretations face continued uncertainty.

Transparency remains uneven. While BEPS Action 14 encourages publication of competent authority agreements, many jurisdictions maintain significant positions through unpublished administrative guidance. Taxpayers may be affected by interpretive positions they cannot readily identify, creating planning difficulties and potential compliance surprises.

Resource constraints affect competent authority capacity, particularly in developing countries. The BEPS Action 14 peer reviews consistently identify inadequate staffing and expertise as implementation challenges. Jurisdictions with limited competent authority resources may struggle to engage effectively in interpretation proceedings, potentially accepting interpretations that more capable counterparts propose.

The relationship between competent authority agreement and court interpretation creates additional complexity. Courts in some jurisdictions treat competent authority positions as entitled to significant deference; others approach them as merely one factor in independent judicial analysis. This variance means competent authority agreement provides more certain guidance in some legal systems than others.

Despite these limitations, Article 25(3) remains the primary mechanism for coordinated treaty interpretation between contracting states. It provides procedural framework for achieving uniform application, reducing the divergence that uncoordinated domestic interpretation would produce. Its effectiveness depends on competent authority resources, commitment to constructive engagement, and willingness to reach agreement—factors that BEPS Action 14 monitoring seeks to strengthen across the global treaty network.
