## Chapter 17.4: BEPS Action 15 – Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties

### 1. Introduction and Background

#### 1.1. The Challenge of Bilateral Treaty Modification

The international tax treaty network comprises over 3,000 bilateral agreements, each negotiated individually between pairs of countries. When the BEPS project identified treaty-related measures necessary to address base erosion and profit shifting, a fundamental implementation challenge emerged: modifying this vast network treaty by treaty would take decades and consume enormous resources.

Bilateral treaty modification requires each pair of countries to negotiate, sign, ratify, and bring into force an amending protocol. With the typical treaty renegotiation taking several years, systematically updating the global treaty network was impractical. This challenge threatened to undermine the BEPS project's effectiveness, as taxpayers could continue exploiting gaps in treaties that remained unmodified.

#### 1.2. The BEPS Action 15 Mandate

BEPS Action 15 addressed this challenge by developing a multilateral instrument capable of modifying bilateral tax treaties simultaneously. The Action's mandate was to analyze the feasibility of such an instrument under international law and to develop the legal architecture necessary for its implementation.

The Final Report on Action 15, published in October 2015, concluded that a multilateral instrument was both feasible and desirable. Drawing on precedents from other areas of international law—particularly environmental and trade agreements that modify existing bilateral commitments—the report established that a properly designed multilateral convention could achieve the necessary treaty modifications efficiently and coherently.

#### 1.3. Historical Precedent and Innovation

While multilateral modification of bilateral treaties was unprecedented in taxation, international law offered relevant precedents. The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides the legal framework for treaty modification, including through subsequent multilateral agreements. Environmental protocols and trade agreements had employed similar techniques to update bilateral commitments multilaterally.

The innovation in Action 15 lay in adapting these precedents to the specific characteristics of tax treaties. Tax treaties involve detailed allocative rules and technical provisions that require precise coordination between the modifying instrument and existing bilateral texts. The multilateral instrument needed to accommodate the diversity of existing treaty provisions while achieving consistent implementation of BEPS measures.

### 2. Development of the Multilateral Instrument

#### 2.1. The Ad Hoc Group Process

Following the October 2015 Final Report, an Ad Hoc Group was established to develop the multilateral instrument. The Ad Hoc Group, open to all interested countries, began work in November 2015 and met eight times over the following year. This inclusive process ensured broad participation beyond OECD member states, reflecting the global nature of the treaty network to be modified.

The Ad Hoc Group addressed the substantial technical challenges of designing an instrument that would interact with thousands of diverse bilateral treaties. Key decisions included the scope of BEPS measures to be included, the flexibility mechanisms necessary to accommodate different country preferences, and the procedures for determining how the instrument would modify specific treaty relationships.

#### 2.2. Adoption and Opening for Signature

The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS—commonly known as the MLI—was adopted on 24 November 2016. The text was opened for signature at a ceremony in Paris on 7 June 2017, where 67 jurisdictions signed the instrument. This represented an unprecedented achievement in international tax cooperation.

Subsequent signature ceremonies have expanded participation. As of January 2025, 104 jurisdictions have signed the MLI, and the instrument covers the modification of approximately 2,000 bilateral tax treaties. This scope of modification would have been impossible to achieve through bilateral renegotiation within any reasonable timeframe.

#### 2.3. Entry into Force

The MLI entered into force on 1 July 2018, three months after the fifth instrument of ratification was deposited. For individual jurisdictions, the MLI enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months from their deposit of ratification. For specific treaty relationships, the MLI provisions take effect according to schedules specified in the convention, typically tied to the later of the two parties' entry into force dates.

The distinction between entry into force for a jurisdiction and effect for a specific treaty relationship is important. A country may have ratified the MLI, but its bilateral treaties are only modified once both treaty partners have ratified and the applicable provisions take effect for that relationship.

### 3. Structure and Architecture of the MLI

#### 3.1. The Seven Parts of the MLI

The MLI comprises 39 articles organized into seven parts:

**Part I (Articles 1-2)** establishes scope and interpretation. Article 1 defines the relationship between the MLI and Covered Tax Agreements, establishing that the MLI modifies rather than replaces existing treaties. Article 2 provides interpretive guidance for understanding how MLI provisions interact with existing treaty texts.

**Part II (Articles 3-5)** addresses hybrid mismatch arrangements, implementing BEPS Action 2 recommendations. These provisions target arrangements that exploit differences in the characterization of entities or instruments to achieve double non-taxation.

**Part III (Articles 6-11)** addresses treaty abuse, implementing BEPS Action 6 recommendations. This part includes the preamble language requirement, the principal purpose test, and provisions addressing specific abuse scenarios.

**Part IV (Articles 12-15)** addresses avoidance of permanent establishment status, implementing BEPS Action 7 recommendations. These provisions tighten the circumstances in which commissionnaire arrangements and similar structures can avoid creating a taxable presence.

**Part V (Articles 16-17)** addresses dispute resolution, implementing BEPS Action 14 recommendations. Article 16 strengthens the mutual agreement procedure, while Article 17 provides for corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases.

**Part VI (Articles 18-26)** provides for mandatory binding arbitration. This part is optional—jurisdictions may choose not to apply it—but establishes a framework for guaranteed dispute resolution where competent authorities cannot reach agreement. *(covered in June 2024)*

**Part VII (Articles 27-39)** contains final provisions regarding signature, ratification, reservations, notifications, and entry into force.

#### 3.2. Covered Tax Agreements

A central concept in the MLI architecture is the Covered Tax Agreement (CTA). When signing and ratifying the MLI, each jurisdiction identifies which of its bilateral tax treaties it wishes to be covered by the instrument. Only treaties that both parties have identified as covered will be modified.

This matching requirement ensures that modifications occur only by mutual consent. If Country A lists its treaty with Country B as covered, but Country B does not list the same treaty, that treaty remains unmodified by the MLI. This respects the bilateral nature of tax treaties while enabling multilateral modification where both parties agree.

The CTA system also allows jurisdictions to exclude certain treaties from MLI modification—for example, treaties recently renegotiated to include BEPS measures, where MLI modification would be redundant.

#### 3.3. Flexibility Mechanisms

The MLI provides multiple flexibility mechanisms to accommodate divergent preferences:

**Opt-in provisions** allow jurisdictions to choose whether to apply optional articles. For example, Part VI arbitration is entirely optional.

**Alternative provisions** allow jurisdictions to choose among different approaches. Article 5, for instance, offers three methods for addressing dual-resident entities.

**Reservations** allow jurisdictions to exclude the application of specific provisions entirely. Many articles permit reservations, enabling countries to decline provisions inconsistent with their treaty policy.

**Notifications** communicate choices under these mechanisms. Each jurisdiction's MLI position is documented through notifications that identify CTAs, chosen options, and reservations.

### 4. Minimum Standards

#### 4.1. Article 6: Treaty Purpose

Article 6 modifies treaty preambles to include language confirming that the purpose of the treaty includes preventing tax avoidance and evasion, specifically treaty shopping. The preamble states that the parties intend the treaty not to create opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including treaty-shopping arrangements.

This minimum standard establishes the interpretive context for all treaty provisions. Courts and competent authorities applying treaty provisions do so in light of the stated anti-abuse purpose. Article 6 contains no reservation option—all jurisdictions must accept this preamble modification.

#### 4.2. Article 7: Prevention of Treaty Abuse

Article 7 implements the principal purpose test (PPT) or equivalent anti-abuse provisions. Under the PPT, treaty benefits are denied if one of the principal purposes of an arrangement was to obtain the benefit, unless granting the benefit would be in accordance with the treaty's object and purpose. *(covered in December 2023)*

Jurisdictions may choose between the PPT alone, a simplified limitation on benefits (LOB) provision combined with anti-conduit rules, or detailed LOB provisions (subject to bilateral negotiation). Most jurisdictions have adopted the PPT as the primary anti-abuse mechanism.

Like Article 6, Article 7 contains no reservation option regarding the requirement to adopt some anti-abuse provision. However, the choice among mechanisms provides flexibility in implementation.

#### 4.3. Article 16: Mutual Agreement Procedure

Article 16 strengthens the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) by requiring that cases be presented to the competent authority of either Contracting State within three years. This modification aligns treaties with the BEPS Action 14 minimum standard on MAP access. Jurisdictions may reserve on certain aspects of Article 16, but the core improvements to MAP access represent a minimum commitment.

### 5. Optional Provisions and the Arbitration Framework

#### 5.1. The Opt-In/Opt-Out System

Beyond minimum standards, the MLI provisions operate on an opt-in or opt-out basis depending on the specific article. Some provisions apply unless a jurisdiction reserves; others apply only if a jurisdiction affirmatively opts in. This asymmetry reflects the different nature of various provisions—some represent consensus positions where deviation requires justification, others represent optional enhancements.

#### 5.2. Matching and Compatibility

For each provision, the MLI specifies compatibility clauses that determine when and how the provision modifies existing treaty text. The compatibility analysis considers whether existing provisions address the same subject matter and whether the MLI provision should replace, supplement, or not apply to the existing provision.

These compatibility rules are technically complex but essential to ensuring that MLI modifications interact appropriately with the diverse existing treaty provisions across 2,000 affected agreements.

#### 5.3. Part VI Arbitration

Part VI establishes mandatory binding arbitration where competent authorities are unable to reach agreement under the MAP within two years. Jurisdictions opting into Part VI may choose between final offer arbitration (the default) and independent opinion arbitration.

Arbitration under Part VI is not part of the minimum standard. Many jurisdictions—particularly developing countries—have declined to adopt Part VI, viewing binding arbitration as inconsistent with their tax sovereignty concerns. As of 2024, approximately 30 jurisdictions have adopted Part VI, creating arbitration availability for treaty relationships where both parties have opted in.

### 6. Implementation and Impact

#### 6.1. Global Adoption and Synthesized Texts

The 104 signatories as of January 2025 represent a substantial majority of the global treaty network. However, signature alone does not complete implementation—jurisdictions must ratify the MLI and deposit instruments of ratification before their treaties are modified.

To assist taxpayers and tax authorities in understanding how the MLI modifies specific bilateral treaties, the OECD publishes synthesized texts that consolidate treaty provisions as modified by the MLI. These documents show the resulting treaty text after MLI modifications take effect.

#### 6.2. Effectiveness and Ongoing Development

The MLI represents the most significant development in international tax treaty administration in decades. It has demonstrated that multilateral modification of bilateral commitments is feasible and can be achieved within reasonable timeframes. The instrument successfully implemented core BEPS measures across thousands of treaties far more rapidly than bilateral renegotiation would have permitted.

The MLI's coverage, while substantial, is not universal. Notably, the United States has not signed the instrument, meaning U.S. bilateral treaties remain unmodified by the MLI and must be addressed individually. This gap reflects the particular structure of U.S. treaty policy, which already includes robust limitation on benefits provisions addressing many concerns the MLI targets. The absence of the world's largest economy from the MLI framework nonetheless represents a significant limitation on the instrument's global reach.

The experience with the MLI may inform future multilateral initiatives in international taxation. As the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework develops the Pillar One and Pillar Two frameworks addressing profit allocation and minimum taxation, the MLI precedent demonstrates that coordinated multilateral action on tax treaties is achievable. Whether future initiatives will employ similar mechanisms remains to be seen, but Action 15 has established that the technical and political obstacles to multilateral treaty modification can be overcome.
