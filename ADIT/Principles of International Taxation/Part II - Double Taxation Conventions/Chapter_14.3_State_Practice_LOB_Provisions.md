# Chapter 14.3: State Practice with Respect to Limitation of Benefit Provisions

## 1. Introduction and Framework

### 1.1. Overview of State Practice

State practice regarding limitation of benefit provisions reveals significant divergence in approaches to preventing treaty abuse. While the BEPS Action 6 minimum standard requires all Inclusive Framework members to implement measures against treaty shopping, the choice between rules-based Limitation on Benefits provisions and standards-based Principal Purpose Test approaches reflects differing policy priorities, legal traditions, and administrative capacities.

The current global landscape demonstrates overwhelming convergence toward the Principal Purpose Test, with over ninety-nine MLI signatories adopting PPT to satisfy the minimum standard. This convergence contrasts sharply with the United States' continued adherence to detailed LOB provisions, creating a significant exception within the otherwise increasingly harmonised treaty framework. Understanding state practice requires examining not only the formal choice of anti-abuse mechanism but also how different jurisdictions interpret and apply their chosen provisions.

### 1.2. PPT vs LOB Approaches in Practice

The fundamental distinction between PPT and LOB approaches manifests in practical application. LOB provisions establish objective categorical tests—taxpayers either qualify under specified categories or they do not. This provides legal certainty but requires comprehensive drafting anticipating all potential abuse scenarios. PPT provisions apply subjective assessment to all arrangements, asking whether obtaining treaty benefits was one of the principal purposes. This provides flexibility but creates interpretive uncertainty.

State practice reveals that most jurisdictions prefer flexibility over certainty. The vast majority chose PPT alone rather than combining PPT with simplified LOB or adopting detailed LOB provisions. This preference reflects the practical advantages of standards-based approaches in adapting to novel abuse schemes without requiring treaty renegotiation.

## 2. United States Practice

### 2.1. US Model LOB Provisions

The United States pioneered detailed Limitation on Benefits provisions and continues to advocate for this approach despite global movement toward the PPT. The 2016 US Model Tax Convention contains comprehensive Article 22 LOB provisions establishing multiple qualifying categories. Individuals resident in a contracting state qualify automatically. Governments, political subdivisions, and public entities similarly qualify. Publicly traded companies with shares regularly traded on recognised stock exchanges satisfy LOB requirements, as dispersed ownership eliminates treaty shopping concerns.

Pension funds providing retirement benefits and non-profit organisations devoted to religious, charitable, educational, or scientific purposes qualify without further analysis. Other entities must satisfy both ownership and base erosion tests—more than fifty percent ownership by persons who are themselves qualified persons, and less than fifty percent of gross income paid as deductible expenses to persons who are not residents of either contracting state.

The active trade or business test provides an alternative for entities failing categorical tests. This test requires substantial business activities in the residence state, with income derived in connection with or incidental to that business. The source-state activity generating the income must be substantial relative to the residence-state business—a token operation cannot justify treaty benefits on major investments.

### 2.2. US Treaty Network

The United States has not signed the Multilateral Instrument and maintains its traditional bilateral approach to treaty negotiation. US treaty policy emphasises that detailed LOB provisions provide superior protection against treaty abuse while maintaining legal certainty for legitimate investors. The US position reflects concerns that subjective PPT assessments create unpredictability, particularly when applied by foreign tax authorities with potentially different interpretive approaches.

US treaties typically include additional features absent from OECD Model-based treaties. The branch profits tax provisions in Article 12 of the US Model address secondary tax on branch operations. The use of place of incorporation as the tie-breaker for corporate dual residence—rather than place of effective management—reflects US domestic law concepts. Mandatory binding arbitration provisions ensure dispute resolution mechanisms with teeth (covered in December 2023).

### 2.3. US-Chile Treaty 2024

The US-Chile income tax treaty, concluded in 2024, represents the first new US treaty in over fifteen years. The treaty confirms continued US adherence to detailed LOB provisions rather than PPT adoption. Article 22 of the treaty contains comprehensive limitation on benefits provisions following the US Model framework. The treaty entered into force for withholding taxes on payments made from February 2024.

The treaty demonstrates that US treaty policy remains unchanged despite global adoption of the PPT through the MLI. The extended gap between new US treaties reflects both the resource-intensive nature of bilateral negotiations and the practical reality that most potential treaty partners have already concluded agreements with the United States. Treaty updates increasingly occur through protocol amendments rather than full treaty renegotiations.

## 3. European Approaches

### 3.1. EU Member State Practice Post-MLI

European Union member states have predominantly adopted the Principal Purpose Test through the Multilateral Instrument. This reflects both the PPT's compatibility with EU law principles and the practical advantages of multilateral implementation over bilateral renegotiation. EU states must also comply with the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, creating a two-layer anti-abuse framework combining treaty-based and domestic measures.

ATAD establishes mandatory anti-abuse rules including CFC provisions, interest limitation, hybrid mismatch rules, and exit taxation. ATAD III, effective from January 2026, introduces minimum substance requirements targeting entities lacking genuine economic activity. The three-part gateway test identifies entities with predominantly passive income, primarily cross-border transactions, and outsourced management activities. Such entities must demonstrate minimum substance indicators—own premises, active bank accounts, and qualified decision-making personnel—or face denial of tax residence certificates and treaty benefits.

Germany's practice illustrates the intersection of treaty interpretation and anti-abuse application. The Federal Tax Court in December 2023 confirmed Germany's static approach to OECD Commentary interpretation, holding that Commentary versions not existing before a treaty entered force cannot be relied upon for interpretation. This decision contradicted German Ministry of Finance guidance favouring ambulatory interpretation, creating tension between judicial and administrative approaches within the same jurisdiction.

### 3.2. UK Post-Brexit

The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union significantly affected its treaty practice regarding passive income. The EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, which eliminated withholding taxes on dividends and royalties between associated companies, no longer applies to UK entities. UK companies must now rely on bilateral treaty provisions for reduced withholding rates on payments to and from EU member states.

The UK has no general dividend withholding tax, so Article 10 limitations are relevant primarily for Real Estate Investment Trust distributions. Royalties face twenty percent UK withholding tax, with exemptions for film and equipment royalties. Treaty network provisions become crucial for accessing reduced rates on interest and royalty payments that previously benefited from Directive protections.

UK treaty practice emphasises the Principal Purpose Test adopted through the MLI. UK courts follow an ambulatory approach to OECD Commentary interpretation, as confirmed in Smallwood and reinforced by the Supreme Court in Fowler v HMRC. The UK statutory GAAR, introduced in 2013, provides additional anti-abuse protection with double-reasonableness tests and GAAR Panel approval requirements.

### 3.3. Netherlands and Switzerland

The Netherlands maintains an extensive treaty network covering approximately ninety-eight countries, reflecting its historical role as a holding company jurisdiction. Dutch treaty practice has evolved substantially following BEPS implementation. The Netherlands adopted conditional withholding taxes on interest and royalty payments to low-tax jurisdictions from 2021, subsequently extended to dividends. These measures supplement treaty-based protections by ensuring that conduit arrangements face domestic withholding regardless of treaty provisions.

Dutch treaty practice follows the OECD Model for agreements with developed countries but increasingly incorporates UN Model provisions for treaties with developing countries. This differentiated approach recognises the different policy priorities of capital-importing and capital-exporting states in treaty negotiations.

Switzerland participates in the MLI and has adopted PPT provisions across its extensive treaty network. Swiss practice demonstrates the interaction between banking secrecy traditions and evolving transparency requirements. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has refined beneficial ownership standards for financial instruments, holding that investment-specific risk-bearing supports beneficial owner status even where other risks are transferred through derivatives.

## 4. Asia-Pacific Approaches

### 4.1. India's Treaty Renegotiations

India's experience illustrates developing country responses to perceived treaty abuse. The India-Mauritius treaty historically provided capital gains exemptions that attracted substantial investment routing through Mauritian entities with minimal substance. India renegotiated the treaty in 2016 to introduce source taxation of capital gains, fundamentally altering the treaty's attractiveness for conduit arrangements.

The 2024 protocol incorporating PPT provisions took effect in April 2024. India's Central Board of Direct Taxes issued Circular 1/2025 in January 2025 clarifying that the PPT applies prospectively from treaty effective dates, with shares acquired before April 2017 grandfathered from PPT scrutiny. This guidance addresses the interaction between treaty-based anti-abuse provisions and India's domestic GAAR, suggesting that earlier domestic principles may apply to arrangements predating PPT introduction (covered in June 2024).

India's GAAR provisions in Section 96A of the Income Tax Act explicitly provide that GAAR applies regardless of treaty benefits. This assertive position reflects India's view that source countries retain inherent authority to apply anti-avoidance principles. The SC Lowy case established that Indian tax authorities bear the burden of demonstrating PPT application and cannot presume abuse from structural arrangements alone. The Tiger Global case pending before the India Supreme Court addresses whether grandfathered transactions remain protected despite PPT introduction (covered in June 2023).

### 4.2. Australia and Canada

Australia participates in the MLI and opted into mandatory binding arbitration under Part VI, joining approximately twenty-seven jurisdictions that accepted this provision. Australian courts treat OECD Commentary as a supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, following the precedent established in Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation.

Canada's approach diverged significantly following the Supreme Court's decision in Alta Energy Luxembourg. The Court adopted a predominantly static approach to OECD Commentary interpretation, holding that Commentaries postdating a treaty cannot introduce terms modifying the treaty. Later Commentaries may assist interpretation only if they expand upon or clarify concepts already found in earlier applicable Commentary without extending scope in ways unanticipated by drafters.

The Alta Energy decision emphasised the significance of Luxembourg's observation disagreeing with the 2003 Commentary revisions on anti-avoidance. Interpreting the treaty with reference to Commentary that Luxembourg expressly rejected would contradict basic principles of treaty interpretation. Canada did not opt into MLI arbitration provisions, maintaining its traditional preference for mutual agreement procedures without binding dispute resolution.

## 5. Developing Country Practice

Developing countries face particular challenges in treaty abuse prevention. As predominantly capital-importing nations, they suffer revenue losses when residence-state investors route investments through conduit jurisdictions to access favourable treaty provisions. The benefits of inbound investment must be weighed against the costs of foregone tax revenue on investment returns.

The UN Model Tax Convention provides alternative provisions more protective of source-country taxing rights. Article 12A on fees for technical services and Article 12B on automated digital services grant source taxation rights absent from the OECD Model. Higher permitted withholding rates on dividends, interest, and royalties provide greater revenue retention for capital-importing states.

Developing country participation in the MLI reflects these considerations. Some jurisdictions declined full MLI adoption, viewing certain provisions as constraining policy flexibility without providing corresponding benefits. Arbitration provisions under Part VI attracted limited developing country adoption, with concerns that binding arbitration processes favour capital-exporting countries with greater resources and expertise in international tax disputes.

The G-24 group of developing countries has advocated for robust source taxation provisions and expressed concern that OECD-led processes do not adequately address developing country priorities. The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, initiated in 2024, may provide a more balanced multilateral forum for addressing these concerns (covered in December 2024).

## 6. MLI Implementation

### 6.1. Adoption Statistics

The Multilateral Instrument has achieved remarkable coverage since entering force on 1 July 2018. As of November 2025, one hundred and five jurisdictions have signed the MLI, covering approximately two thousand bilateral treaties. This represents the most significant multilateral development in international tax treaty law, enabling rapid modification of the global treaty network without requiring individual bilateral renegotiations.

The overwhelming majority of signatories—ninety-nine or more—chose the Principal Purpose Test to satisfy the BEPS Action 6 minimum standard. This convergence on a standards-based mechanism represents significant harmonisation across diverse legal traditions and policy preferences. The hybrid approach combining simplified LOB with PPT attracted limited adoption, while the detailed LOB approach without PPT remained essentially unique to US practice.

Approximately twenty-seven jurisdictions opted into mandatory binding arbitration under MLI Part VI. This group includes major economies such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Netherlands, and Australia. The limited adoption reflects concerns about arbitration processes, particularly among developing countries and jurisdictions with constitutional constraints on delegating dispute resolution authority. Canada notably declined arbitration provisions, maintaining its traditional preference for mutual agreement procedures without binding dispute resolution. India similarly did not adopt arbitration, consistent with its emphasis on preserving sovereign discretion in tax matters.

### 6.2. Sixth Peer Review Report

The Sixth Peer Review Report on Treaty Shopping, published November 2025, confirmed that over 1,120 agreements between Inclusive Framework members now comply with the minimum anti-abuse standard. This represents a thirty percent increase in compliant agreements between 2022 and 2023 alone. Approximately 630 additional agreements will become compliant once all signatories complete ratification procedures.

The peer review methodology shifted in 2024 to comprehensive reviews every five years rather than annual assessments. Twelve jurisdictions received recommendations to complete MLI entry into force procedures, while four jurisdictions received recommendations to develop implementation plans for minimum standards. The OECD Secretariat provides interim support to jurisdictions during the extended review cycle.

The report acknowledged ongoing interpretive development regarding the relationship between PPT and LOB provisions where both apply. Questions remain whether LOB satisfaction creates a presumption of treaty entitlement or whether PPT can independently deny benefits to persons satisfying all LOB requirements. The Commentary suggests that LOB provisions themselves reflect treaty object and purpose, implying that LOB satisfaction should generally establish entitlement, but sophisticated abuse that satisfies LOB literally while contradicting purposes remains subject to PPT denial.

## 7. Comparative Analysis

### 7.1. Rules vs Standards Trade-offs

The fundamental tension between LOB and PPT approaches reflects broader legal philosophy debates about rules versus standards. LOB provisions offer legal certainty—taxpayers can structure affairs knowing whether they qualify for benefits. This facilitates legitimate investment by reducing uncertainty and compliance costs. However, detailed rules create opportunities for sophisticated avoidance that satisfies literal requirements while contradicting purposes. Rules also require anticipating all potential abuse scenarios, an increasingly difficult task as financial innovation accelerates.

PPT provisions offer flexibility to address novel abuse schemes without treaty renegotiation. Tax authorities can apply purpose-based analysis to arrangements unanticipated when treaties were negotiated. This adaptability comes at the cost of uncertainty—taxpayers cannot know definitively whether their arrangements will survive PPT scrutiny. The reasonableness standard and object and purpose exception provide some protection for legitimate arrangements, but borderline cases remain unpredictable.

### 7.2. Convergence and Divergence

State practice reveals convergence on the PPT as the primary anti-abuse mechanism, with the United States representing the significant exception. This convergence simplifies treaty interpretation by creating common standards across most of the global treaty network. Taxpayers operating in multiple jurisdictions face similar anti-abuse analysis rather than navigating fundamentally different frameworks.

The US exception creates asymmetry in the treaty network. Treaties between the United States and other countries employ LOB provisions, while those same countries apply PPT in their treaties with each other. This requires sophisticated taxpayers to understand multiple frameworks and structure investments accordingly. Whether US practice will eventually converge with global norms or continue indefinitely as an exception remains an open question.

## 8. Recent Developments

The 2025 OECD Model update maintained existing anti-abuse provisions while introducing guidance on emerging issues. Article 5 Commentary now addresses remote working arrangements, clarifying that employees working from home in another country do not automatically create permanent establishments for their employers. The update reflects post-pandemic recognition that traditional concepts of physical presence require adaptation to modern work patterns.

The withdrawal of the United States from the OECD Inclusive Framework in January 2025 introduced uncertainty regarding future multilateral anti-abuse developments. While the US maintains its traditional LOB approach in bilateral treaties, its departure from Inclusive Framework processes may affect coordination on anti-abuse interpretation and implementation.

The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation initiative may provide an alternative vehicle for multilateral development. The convention envisions comprehensive approaches to international taxation beyond bilateral treaty provisions, potentially including enhanced source taxation provisions more responsive to developing country priorities. Progress on this initiative will depend on achieving consensus among jurisdictions with fundamentally different interests in the allocation of taxing rights.
