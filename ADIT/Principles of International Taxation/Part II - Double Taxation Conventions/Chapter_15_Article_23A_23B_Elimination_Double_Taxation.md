## Chapter 15: Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation – Articles 23A and 23B, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Articles 23A and 23B

Articles 23A and 23B of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) provide the mechanisms through which residence states eliminate juridical double taxation. While the distributive articles (Articles 6-22) allocate taxing rights between states, the method articles specify how the residence state must relieve double taxation where both states exercise permitted taxing rights over the same income or capital.

The method article plays an essential role in the treaty framework. Without relief provisions, the allocation of taxing rights would not prevent double taxation—both states could still tax the same income, with the treaty merely establishing that each state's taxation was legitimate. The method articles transform taxing right allocations into actual relief, requiring the residence state to accommodate source-state taxation through exemption or credit.

#### 1.2. The Two Principal Methods

The OECD Model presents two alternative methods: the exemption method (Article 23A) and the credit method (Article 23B). Both achieve the same fundamental objective—eliminating double taxation—but operate through different mechanisms with different economic consequences.

Under the exemption method, the residence state surrenders its taxing right over foreign-source income, exempting such income from its tax base. The tax burden is determined solely by the source state's rate, and the residence state claims no additional tax regardless of rate differentials.

Under the credit method, the residence state retains its taxing right over worldwide income but grants a credit for source-state tax against residence-state liability. Where source-state rates exceed residence-state rates, the excess credit is typically lost; where residence-state rates exceed source-state rates, the residence state collects the difference.

#### 1.3. Policy Rationale and Economic Neutrality

The choice between exemption and credit reflects fundamental policy choices about economic neutrality. Capital export neutrality (CEN) holds that investors should face the same total tax burden regardless of where they invest—domestic or foreign investment should be equally taxed from the investor's perspective. The credit method supports CEN by ensuring that residence-state taxation "tops up" any shortfall between source-state and residence-state rates.

Capital import neutrality (CIN) holds that all investors competing within a particular market should face the same tax burden regardless of their residence—a level playing field for investment within each jurisdiction. The exemption method supports CIN by allowing source-state rates to determine the tax burden, ensuring that foreign and domestic investors operating in the same market face identical taxation.

Neither principle can be fully realised as long as countries maintain different tax rates. The exemption method sacrifices CEN to achieve CIN; the credit method sacrifices CIN to achieve CEN. Countries choose between these trade-offs based on their policy priorities, economic structures, and negotiating positions.

### 2. Article 23A: The Exemption Method

#### 2.1. Text of Article 23A (OECD MTC 2017)

Article 23A contains four paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1**: "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of this Convention (except to the extent that these provisions allow taxation by that other State solely because the income is also income derived by a resident of that State or because the capital is also capital owned by a resident of that State), the first-mentioned State shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, exempt such income or capital from tax."

**Paragraph 2**: "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives items of income which, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10 and 11, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in that other State. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income derived from that other State."

**Paragraph 3**: "Where in accordance with any provision of this Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of a Contracting State is exempt from tax in that State, such State may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital."

**Paragraph 4**: "The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income derived or capital owned by a resident of a Contracting State where the other Contracting State applies the provisions of this Convention to exempt such income or capital from tax or applies the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10 or 11 to such income."

#### 2.2. Paragraph 1: The Basic Exemption Rule

Paragraph 1 establishes the fundamental exemption obligation. Where income or capital "may be taxed" in the source state under the treaty's distributive rules, the residence state must exempt that income or capital. The exemption applies regardless of whether the source state actually exercises its taxing right—the mere existence of the treaty right triggers the residence state's exemption obligation.

The 2017 amendment added the parenthetical exception preventing the exemption obligation from arising where the source state's taxing right exists solely because the taxpayer is also a resident of that state. This addresses dual residence situations where both states claim residence under domestic law but the tie-breaker rule resolves treaty residence to one state.

The phrase "may be taxed" is critical. It includes both exclusive source-state rights ("shall be taxable only") and shared rights ("may be taxed"). Where the treaty permits source-state taxation, the exemption obligation applies.

#### 2.3. Paragraph 2: Credit for Investment Income

Paragraph 2 creates an exception for dividends (Article 10) and interest (Article 11), applying the credit method rather than exemption to these investment income categories. This reflects the policy concern that passive investment income should not benefit from exemption, which could facilitate base erosion through profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions.

The credit under paragraph 2 is limited to "ordinary credit"—the residence state need not credit more than the residence-state tax attributable to the foreign income. Where source-state withholding exceeds this limit, the excess credit is lost. This limitation prevents high source-state taxation from reducing residence-state tax on domestic-source income.

#### 2.4. Paragraph 3: Exemption with Progression

Paragraph 3 permits "exemption with progression," allowing the residence state to consider exempted income when determining the tax rate applicable to remaining taxable income. Under progressive tax systems, this preserves the relationship between income level and marginal rates.

Without exemption with progression, a taxpayer earning €100,000 (€80,000 domestic, €20,000 foreign-exempt) would be taxed as if earning only €80,000, potentially at a lower marginal rate than their actual income level warrants. Exemption with progression taxes the €80,000 at the rate applicable to €100,000 total income, maintaining progressivity while exempting the foreign income amount.

Most countries applying the exemption method use exemption with progression rather than full exemption. Full exemption—ignoring foreign income entirely for rate determination—is rare in practice.

#### 2.5. Paragraph 4: The Switch-Over Clause

Paragraph 4 is the "switch-over clause," preventing double non-taxation when the source state fails to exercise its taxing rights. Where the source state exempts the income (rather than taxing it under the distributive rule) or applies the reduced dividend/interest withholding rates, the residence state's exemption obligation does not apply.

This provision addresses qualification conflicts where states interpret treaty provisions differently. If the residence state believes source-state taxation is permitted but the source state disagrees and exempts the income, paragraph 4 allows the residence state to tax—preventing the income from escaping taxation entirely.

The 2017 update clarified paragraph 4's scope, addressing situations where both states tax solely as residence states. The Commentary confirms that neither state must provide relief where both exercise residence-based rather than source-based taxation.

### 3. Article 23B: The Credit Method

#### 3.1. Text of Article 23B (OECD MTC 2017)

Article 23B contains two paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1**: "Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of this Convention (except to the extent that these provisions allow taxation by that other State solely because the income is also income derived by a resident of that State or because the capital is also capital owned by a resident of that State), the first-mentioned State shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in that other State; as a deduction from the tax on the capital of that resident, an amount equal to the capital tax paid in that other State. Such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax or capital tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income or the capital which may be taxed in that other State."

**Paragraph 2**: "Where in accordance with any provision of this Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of a Contracting State is exempt from tax in that State, such State may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital."

#### 3.2. Paragraph 1: The Credit Mechanism

Paragraph 1 establishes the ordinary credit method. The residence state allows a deduction (credit) from its tax liability equal to the tax paid in the source state. The credit is limited to the residence-state tax attributable to the foreign income—the "ordinary credit" limitation.

The ordinary credit limitation has significant practical implications. Where source-state rates exceed residence-state rates, the taxpayer receives credit only up to the residence-state tax on that income—the excess source-state tax cannot offset residence-state tax on other income. Where residence-state rates exceed source-state rates, the credit eliminates only the source-state tax amount, leaving the residence state to collect the difference.

The phrase "tax paid" requires actual payment of source-state tax. Taxes merely assessed but not paid, or taxes forgiven through incentives, generally do not qualify for credit absent specific "tax sparing" provisions.

#### 3.3. Ordinary Credit vs. Full Credit

The distinction between ordinary credit and full credit is fundamental. Ordinary credit limits the credit to residence-state tax on the foreign income. Full credit would allow unlimited credit, potentially reducing residence-state tax on domestic income.

Historical context explains this limitation. When credit mechanisms were developed, concerns arose that high-tax countries could effectively absorb residence-state revenue through unlimited credits. The ordinary credit limitation ensures that residence-state taxation on domestic income remains unaffected by foreign tax burdens.

The effect is that where source-state rates exceed residence-state rates, the taxpayer bears total taxation at the higher source-state rate—the residence state provides no additional relief for the excess. This outcome is accepted as the price of preventing cross-subsidisation of residence-state domestic tax collections.

### 4. Comparison of Methods

#### 4.1. Economic Effects

Consider a taxpayer with €100,000 total income (€80,000 domestic, €20,000 foreign). Residence-state rate is 30%; source-state rate is either 20% (Scenario A) or 40% (Scenario B).

**Exemption Method (with progression):**
- Scenario A: Residence-state taxes €80,000 at rate for €100,000 = €24,000 (approx). Source-state taxes €20,000 at 20% = €4,000. Total: €28,000.
- Scenario B: Same residence-state calculation = €24,000. Source-state taxes €20,000 at 40% = €8,000. Total: €32,000.

**Credit Method (ordinary):**
- Scenario A: Residence-state calculates €30,000 tax on €100,000, credits €4,000 source-state tax. Net residence: €26,000. Total: €30,000 (30% effective rate maintained).
- Scenario B: Residence-state calculates €30,000, credits only €6,000 (residence-state tax on €20,000). Net residence: €24,000. Total: €32,000 (excess source tax borne by taxpayer).

The exemption method results in variable effective rates depending on source-state taxation. The credit method maintains the residence-state effective rate as a floor, with source-state excess tax adding to the burden.

#### 4.2. Administrative Considerations

The exemption method is administratively simpler—the residence state ignores foreign income (for amount, not rate). The credit method requires detailed calculations: determining the residence-state tax attributable to foreign income, categorising income by source, and tracking credits against limitations.

However, the exemption method creates incentive concerns. Taxpayers may shift income to low-tax jurisdictions, enjoying low taxation without residence-state "top-up." The credit method provides automatic anti-avoidance protection by ensuring residence-state taxation regardless of source-state rates.

### 5. UN Model Comparison

#### 5.1. Substantive Similarity

The UN Model's Articles 23A and 23B are substantively similar to the OECD versions. Both models offer the same two methods—exemption and credit—with the same basic mechanics. The UN Commentary acknowledges that developing countries may prefer the credit method, which preserves residence-state revenue more effectively than exemption.

#### 5.2. Application in Practice

Bilateral treaties between developed and developing countries often reflect negotiated compromises. A developed residence country may apply exemption for active business income (maintaining CIN for its enterprises operating abroad) while applying credit for passive investment income (preventing base erosion through portfolio shifts to low-tax sources).

Developing countries, typically as source states, benefit from either method—their source-state taxation is accommodated regardless of which method the residence state applies. The choice primarily affects residence-state revenue and the residence-state taxpayer's effective rate.

### 6. Practical Application Issues

#### 6.1. Per-Country vs. Overall Limitation

Countries applying the credit method must choose between per-country limitation and overall limitation. Per-country limitation calculates the credit ceiling separately for each source country, preventing high-tax source-country credits from offsetting residence-state tax on low-tax source-country income. Overall limitation pools all foreign income and foreign taxes, potentially allowing cross-crediting.

The OECD Model does not specify which approach applies—domestic law determines the limitation methodology. Countries may also apply per-item or basket limitations, separating passive and active income for credit calculation purposes.

#### 6.2. Timing Differences

Timing differences between source-state and residence-state tax years create practical challenges. If source-state tax is paid in Year 2 for income recognised in Year 1, the credit may not be available until Year 2 even though residence-state tax applied in Year 1. Carry-forward and carry-back provisions in domestic law may mitigate these timing mismatches.

#### 6.3. Tax Sparing

Tax sparing provisions allow credits for source-state tax that would have been payable but for incentive exemptions. Where a source country offers tax holidays to attract investment, tax sparing preserves the incentive benefit by allowing residence-state credit as if tax had been paid.

Tax sparing is not included in the OECD Model but appears in some bilateral treaties, particularly those between developed and developing countries. The OECD has been critical of tax sparing, viewing it as undermining residence-state tax sovereignty and facilitating base erosion.

### 7. The 2017 Updates

#### 7.1. BEPS Action 6 Influence

The 2017 updates to Articles 23A and 23B reflect BEPS Action 6 concerns about treaty abuse and double non-taxation. The amendments clarify that relief obligations do not extend to situations where both states tax purely as residence states—only source-state or PE-state taxation triggers residence-state relief obligations.

This clarification addresses specific abuse scenarios where taxpayers claimed residence in multiple states, potentially obtaining relief from both while being taxed by neither in a source capacity.

#### 7.2. Commentary Additions

Commentary paragraphs 11.1 and 11.2 were added to elaborate on these clarifications. The Commentary confirms that where State A taxes a person as a resident and State B also taxes the same person as a resident (without source-state taxation in either case), neither state is obligated to provide treaty relief for the other's resident-based taxation.

### 8. Relationship with Other Articles

#### 8.1. Interaction with Distributive Articles

Articles 23A and 23B operate in conjunction with the distributive articles. The method articles activate only where a distributive article permits source-state taxation. Where a distributive article grants exclusive residence-state taxation (e.g., Article 21's "taxable only" language), no relief obligation arises because no source-state taxation exists to relieve.

The distinction between "may be taxed" and "shall be taxable only" is therefore critical. The former triggers method article obligations; the latter does not (there being nothing to relieve).

#### 8.2. Interaction with Article 24 (Non-Discrimination)

The method articles must be applied consistently with Article 24's non-discrimination provisions. A residence state cannot apply different methods to comparable taxpayers based on nationality or other prohibited grounds. The choice of method must be uniformly applied within the treaty framework.

### 9. Emerging Issues

#### 9.1. Pillar Two Implications

The OECD/G20 Pillar Two framework introducing a 15% global minimum tax interacts with traditional treaty relief mechanisms. Where a residence state applies the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) to "top up" taxation on foreign income, questions arise about coordination with treaty credit obligations.

The current understanding is that Pillar Two operates alongside rather than through treaties, but the interaction between minimum tax mechanisms and traditional credit/exemption relief remains an evolving area.

#### 9.2. Subject to Tax Rules

Subject to tax rules (STTRs), prominent in the UN Model's 2021 updates, condition treaty benefits on actual taxation in the other state. These rules interact with method articles by potentially denying source-state relief where residence-state taxation is insufficient, addressing double non-taxation concerns through a different mechanism than the switch-over clause.
