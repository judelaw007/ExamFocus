# Chapter 3.3: Specific States' Models - The US MTC and the Dutch MTC

## 1. Why States Develop Their Own Model Conventions

While the OECD MTC and UN MDTC provide internationally recognised frameworks for bilateral treaty negotiations, certain states develop their own model conventions to address unique features of their domestic tax systems. States may require treaty provisions that accommodate distinctive aspects of their tax law, such as the United States' citizenship-based taxation. A state-specific model provides a consistent negotiating position across all treaty negotiations, ensuring that national policy preferences are systematically pursued rather than addressed on an ad hoc basis.

State models also serve as efficient starting points for negotiations, clearly articulating national priorities from the outset. Some states emphasise anti-avoidance provisions, while others design treaty features supporting particular economic structures, such as the Netherlands' holding company arrangements.

Despite these distinctive features, state-specific models typically use the OECD or UN Model as their structural foundation, adding or modifying provisions to address domestic concerns while maintaining overall consistency with international standards.

## 2. The United States Model Tax Convention

### 2.1. The Saving Clause

The US Model Income Tax Convention, most recently updated in 2016, reflects the unique features of the US tax system. The most distinctive element is the saving clause, which preserves the US right to tax its citizens and residents as if the treaty had not entered into force.

The saving clause exists because the United States, along with Eritrea, is one of only two countries that taxes based on citizenship rather than residence alone. A US citizen living abroad remains subject to US tax on worldwide income regardless of where they reside. Without the saving clause, treaty provisions might be interpreted to limit this fundamental taxing right.

However, certain treaty provisions are exempted from the saving clause, including the foreign tax credit, non-discrimination, and mutual agreement procedure. These exceptions ensure that US citizens abroad receive essential treaty protections necessary to prevent actual double taxation.

The saving clause concept, originating in US treaty practice, was subsequently adopted in modified form in the OECD MTC 2017 (Article 1(3)) and the UN MDTC 2021, demonstrating US influence on the broader evolution of international tax treaty standards.

### 2.2. Limitation on Benefits

The United States has developed the most comprehensive Limitation on Benefits (LOB) provisions of any country, designed to prevent treaty shopping—the use of a tax treaty by residents of third countries who establish entities in a treaty country primarily to obtain treaty benefits not intended for them.

The US Model's Article 22 establishes a detailed, rules-based approach requiring treaty claimants to satisfy specific tests. These include qualified person tests (covering individuals, governments, publicly traded companies, pension funds, and companies meeting ownership and base erosion requirements), an active trade or business test, a derivative benefits test, and a headquarters company test. Discretionary relief through the competent authority is available where none of the objective tests are satisfied.

This rules-based approach contrasts with the standards-based Principal Purpose Test (PPT) adopted by the OECD following the BEPS Project. While the PPT involves subjective assessment of whether a principal purpose of an arrangement was to obtain treaty benefits, the US LOB approach requires claimants to satisfy specific, objectively defined criteria. The OECD's Action 6 (Treaty Abuse) recommendations were significantly influenced by US LOB practice, though the OECD ultimately adopted the PPT as its primary anti-abuse mechanism while offering LOB as a supplementary option.

### 2.3. Other Distinctive Features

Several other features distinguish the US Model from the OECD and UN Models.

The US Model includes specific provisions for the branch profits tax, which applies when a foreign corporation operates in the United States through a branch rather than a subsidiary. This tax approximates the dividend withholding tax that would apply if the branch were a subsidiary paying dividends to its foreign parent, ensuring equivalent treatment regardless of legal form.

For resolving dual residence of companies, the US Model uses place of incorporation or organisation as the tie-breaker, rather than the place of effective management used in the OECD Model. This reflects the traditional US emphasis on legal formalities in determining corporate residence.

The United States consistently refuses to include tax sparing credits in its treaties, reflecting a policy view that tax sparing facilitates tax avoidance rather than promoting genuine development. The US Model also includes mandatory binding arbitration provisions, reflecting US support for certainty in dispute resolution.

## 3. The Dutch Model Tax Convention

### 3.1. OECD Alignment and Treaty Network

The Netherlands publishes its own model convention through the Note on Tax Treaty Policy (Notitie Fiscaal Verdragsbeleid), which serves as the basis for Dutch treaty negotiations. Unlike the US Model's distinctive features, the Dutch Model closely follows the OECD Model structure with relatively minor variations.

The Netherlands has developed one of the world's most extensive treaty networks, with active treaties covering 98 countries. This extensive network historically supported the Netherlands' role as a major holding company jurisdiction, providing reduced withholding taxes on inbound dividends, interest, and royalties, and facilitating efficient international investment structures.

The Dutch treaty network complemented domestic features that made the Netherlands attractive for holding structures: the participation exemption for qualifying dividends and capital gains, historically no withholding tax on interest and royalties, and an established ruling practice providing certainty.

In its current treaty policy, the Netherlands follows the OECD Model for treaties with developed countries but increasingly applies UN Model provisions for treaties with developing countries, recognising their legitimate interest in greater source-country taxing rights.

### 3.2. Post-BEPS Developments

The Netherlands has significantly updated its treaty policy and domestic rules following the BEPS Project and broader international pressure on preferential regimes.

The MLI has modified many existing Dutch treaties, incorporating anti-abuse provisions including the Principal Purpose Test. A conditional withholding tax on interest and royalty payments to low-tax jurisdictions was introduced in 2021, and subsequently extended to dividend payments, representing a significant departure from the Netherlands' historical approach of imposing no withholding on such payments.

Substance requirements have been enhanced and the ruling practice has become more restrictive. Treaty negotiations continue actively, with the 2025 agenda including treaties with Bangladesh, Belgium, Germany, and Sint Maarten.

These developments reflect a reorientation of Dutch treaty policy from primarily facilitating international investment toward a more balanced approach addressing base erosion concerns while maintaining the Netherlands' role as an international business hub.
