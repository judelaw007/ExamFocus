## A. WHY DO STATES DEVELOP THEIR OWN MODEL CONVENTIONS?

### 1. Purpose of State-Specific Models

While the OECD MTC and UN MDTC provide internationally recognized frameworks, some states develop their own model conventions because:

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unique domestic tax features** | Domestic tax rules may require specific treaty provisions (e.g., US citizenship-based taxation) |
| **Policy preferences** | States may have consistent positions they wish to negotiate across all treaties |
| **Negotiating efficiency** | Provides starting point reflecting national priorities |
| **Anti-avoidance focus** | Some states prioritize stronger anti-treaty shopping provisions |
| **Economic structure** | Treaty features may support particular business structures (e.g., Dutch holding companies) |

### 2. Relationship to OECD/UN Models

State models typically:
- Use OECD or UN structure as foundation
- Add provisions reflecting national tax policy
- Modify standard articles to address domestic concerns
- Serve as negotiating templates, not final treaties

---

## B. THE UNITED STATES MODEL TAX CONVENTION

### 1. Overview

The US Model Income Tax Convention (most recent version: 2016) reflects the unique features of the US tax system and American tax treaty policy. It differs significantly from the OECD Model in several key respects.

```
US MODEL TAX CONVENTION - KEY CHARACTERISTICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DISTINCTIVE FEATURES (not in OECD/UN Models):
  1. Saving Clause (Article 1)
  2. Comprehensive Limitation on Benefits (Article 22)
  3. Branch Profits Tax provisions (Article 10)
  4. Citizenship-based taxation accommodation
  5. Place of incorporation tie-breaker

POLICY EMPHASIS:
  • Strong anti-treaty shopping provisions
  • Protection of US tax base
  • No tax sparing credits
  • Mandatory binding arbitration

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. The Saving Clause

The **saving clause** is the most distinctive feature of US treaty practice, originating from the US system of citizenship-based taxation.

**What It Does:**
- Preserves the US right to tax its citizens and residents as if the treaty had not entered into force
- Ensures US can apply worldwide taxation to US persons regardless of treaty benefits
- Subject to specific exceptions for certain treaty provisions

**Why It Exists:**
The US (along with Eritrea) is one of only two countries that taxes based on **citizenship** rather than just residence. A US citizen living abroad remains subject to US tax on worldwide income. Without a saving clause, treaty provisions might be interpreted to limit this taxation right.

```
SAVING CLAUSE OPERATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Article 1(4) US Model (2016):
"[T]his Convention shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting
State of its residents... and its citizens..."

EFFECT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ US CITIZEN RESIDING IN TREATY PARTNER COUNTRY                  │
│                                                                 │
│ Without saving clause:                                          │
│   Treaty might limit US taxing rights                           │
│                                                                 │
│ With saving clause:                                             │
│   US retains right to tax citizen's worldwide income            │
│   (Foreign tax credit available to prevent double taxation)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXCEPTIONS to saving clause typically include:
  • Foreign tax credit (Article 23)
  • Non-discrimination (Article 24)
  • Mutual agreement procedure (Article 25)
  • Certain pension provisions (Article 18)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Exam Relevance:** The saving clause concept was adopted in modified form in the OECD MTC 2017 (Article 1(3)) and UN MDTC 2021. When examining saving clauses, be aware of their US origin.

### 3. Limitation on Benefits (LOB) - Article 22

The US has the most comprehensive **Limitation on Benefits** (LOB) provisions of any country, designed to prevent **treaty shopping**.

**Treaty Shopping Definition:**
The use of a tax treaty by residents of third countries who establish entities in a treaty country primarily to obtain treaty benefits not intended for them.

```
US LOB ARTICLE - KEY TESTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

To qualify for treaty benefits under US treaties, a resident must
satisfy ONE of the following tests:

1. QUALIFIED PERSON TESTS:
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ a) Individual                                                │
   │ b) Government or central bank                                │
   │ c) Publicly traded company (on recognized stock exchange)    │
   │ d) Pension fund or tax-exempt organization                   │
   │ e) Company meeting ownership/base erosion test               │
   │    - >50% owned by qualified residents                       │
   │    - <50% of gross income paid to non-qualified persons      │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

2. ACTIVE TRADE OR BUSINESS TEST:
   • Entity engaged in substantial trade/business in residence state
   • Income derived in connection with or incidental to that business

3. DERIVATIVE BENEFITS TEST:
   • Ownership by persons who would have been entitled to
     equivalent benefits under their own treaties

4. HEADQUARTERS COMPANY TEST:
   • For multinational group headquarters

5. DISCRETIONARY RELIEF:
   • Competent authority may grant benefits in appropriate cases

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Comparison with OECD Approach:**
| Feature | US Model LOB | OECD MTC (Post-BEPS) |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Primary mechanism** | Detailed LOB article | Principal Purpose Test (PPT) |
| **Approach** | Rules-based (specific tests) | Standards-based (subjective assessment) |
| **Complexity** | Very detailed and comprehensive | Simpler but less certain |
| **Flexibility** | Limited (must meet specific test) | Greater (based on purposes) |

### 4. Branch Profits Tax

The US Model includes provisions for the US **branch profits tax**, which has no equivalent in the OECD or UN Models.

**How It Works:**
- When a foreign corporation operates in the US through a branch (rather than a subsidiary), US taxes the "dividend equivalent amount"
- This approximates the tax that would apply if the branch were a subsidiary paying dividends to its foreign parent
- Treaty provisions limit the rate (typically same as dividend rate)

### 5. Other Distinctive US Model Features

| Feature | US Model Approach |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Tie-breaker for companies** | Place of incorporation/organization (not POEM as in OECD) |
| **Tax sparing credits** | NOT included (US opposes tax sparing) |
| **Arbitration** | Mandatory binding arbitration included |
| **WHT on dividends** | Does not specify rates (unlike OECD 5%/15%) |
| **Special tax regimes** | Provisions to deny benefits for income subject to preferential treatment (2016 addition) |

### 6. US Model vs OECD Model - Quick Comparison

| Aspect | US Model | OECD Model |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Saving clause** | Comprehensive | Added in 2017 (modified form) |
| **LOB provisions** | Detailed, rules-based | PPT-based (BEPS) |
| **Citizenship taxation** | Explicitly accommodated | Not addressed |
| **Branch profits tax** | Specific provisions | No equivalent |
| **Company tie-breaker** | Place of incorporation | Place of effective management |
| **Tax sparing** | Never included | Optional |
| **Policy emphasis** | Anti-avoidance, base protection | Balanced allocation |

## C. THE DUTCH MODEL TAX CONVENTION

### 1. Overview

The Netherlands publishes its own model tax convention (Notitie Fiscaal Verdragsbeleid / Note on Tax Treaty Policy) that serves as a basis for treaty negotiations. The Dutch Model is notable for its alignment with OECD principles while reflecting the Netherlands' role as a major holding company jurisdiction.

```
DUTCH MODEL TAX CONVENTION - KEY CHARACTERISTICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

GENERAL APPROACH:
  • Closely follows OECD Model structure
  • Reflects Netherlands' extensive treaty network (90+ treaties)
  • Supports Dutch role as holding company jurisdiction
  • Incorporates BEPS recommendations

KEY FEATURES:
  1. Based on OECD Model with minor variations
  2. Supports participation exemption regime
  3. Historically favorable for conduit structures
  4. Recent updates for BEPS compliance
  5. MLI implementation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Dutch Treaty Network and Policy

The Netherlands has developed one of the world's most extensive tax treaty networks, which traditionally supported the country's role as a gateway for international investment.

**Historical Features:**
- Treaties generally provided favorable withholding tax rates
- Network facilitated holding company structures
- Advance Tax Rulings (ATRs) provided certainty
- Combination with domestic participation exemption made Netherlands attractive

**Recent Developments:**
Post-BEPS, the Netherlands has updated its treaty policy and domestic rules:
- Conditional withholding tax on interest/royalties to low-tax jurisdictions (introduced 2021)
- Enhanced substance requirements for treaty benefits
- MLI implementation modifying many existing treaties
- Stricter ruling practice

### 3. Key Dutch Model Features

| **Participation exemption** | Domestic regime reflected in treaty policy |
| **Withholding taxes** | Historically low; recent changes for low-tax jurisdictions |
| **Anti-abuse** | PPT approach (BEPS-compliant) |
| **Arbitration** | Generally included in modern treaties |
| **Shipping/Transport** | Specific provisions reflecting Dutch shipping industry |

### 4. Dutch Model vs OECD Model

The Dutch Model closely follows the OECD Model but may include:

| Aspect | Dutch Variation |
|--------|-----------------|
| **LOB provisions** | PPT-based (follows OECD BEPS approach) |
| **Pension provisions** | May include specific Dutch pension features |
| **Holding companies** | Treaty policy historically favorable to holding structures |
| **Shipping income** | Specific provisions for Dutch shipping sector |
| **Recent treaties** | Incorporate BEPS-driven anti-abuse measures |

## E. EXAM APPLICATION

### 1. Recognition Triggers

For Level 1 topics, expect US/Dutch MTC mentions in these contexts:
- Comparative discussions of anti-abuse provisions
- Saving clause questions (US origin)
- LOB vs PPT comparisons
- Holding company or treaty shopping discussions
- Citizenship-based taxation references

### 2. What Examiners Expect at Level 1

```
LEVEL 1 EXPECTATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOU SHOULD KNOW:
✓ Why states have their own models (unique domestic features)
✓ US Model: saving clause, LOB, citizenship taxation, no tax sparing
✓ Dutch Model: OECD-based, supports holding structures, extensive
  treaty network
✓ How these differ from OECD/UN Models at high level

YOU DO NOT NEED TO:
✗ Memorize specific article numbers of US/Dutch Models
✗ Know detailed LOB tests in depth
✗ Analyze specific US or Dutch treaty provisions
✗ Compare multiple specific articles across models

LIKELY EXAM USE:
  • Brief mention as context in broader DTC question
  • Comparison point when discussing saving clause or LOB
  • Background for treaty shopping/anti-abuse discussion
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Sample Exam Integration

If a question involves saving clauses or LOB provisions, you might reference:

> "The saving clause concept originated in US treaty practice, reflecting the unique US system of citizenship-based taxation. The US Model Tax Convention has long included comprehensive saving clause provisions, which were later adopted in modified form in the OECD MTC 2017 (Article 1(3))."

> "The detailed LOB provisions characteristic of US treaties represent a rules-based approach to preventing treaty shopping, contrasting with the standards-based Principal Purpose Test (PPT) approach adopted by the OECD post-BEPS."

## F. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS FOR EXAM (Level 1)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

US MODEL TAX CONVENTION:
  1. Saving clause - preserves US right to tax citizens/residents
  2. Citizenship-based taxation - unique US feature accommodated
  3. Comprehensive LOB - detailed rules to prevent treaty shopping
  4. Branch profits tax - no OECD equivalent
  5. No tax sparing - consistent US policy
  6. Place of incorporation tie-breaker (not POEM)

DUTCH MODEL TAX CONVENTION:
  1. Based on OECD Model with minor variations
  2. Extensive treaty network (90+ treaties)
  3. Supports holding company structures
  4. Historically favorable WHT treatment
  5. Post-BEPS: stricter anti-abuse, MLI adoption
  6. Recent: conditional WHT on payments to low-tax jurisdictions

WHY STATES HAVE OWN MODELS:
  • Domestic tax features requiring specific provisions
  • Consistent negotiating positions
  • Policy preferences (anti-avoidance vs investment facilitation)
  • Economic structure support

COMPARISON:
  • US: Strong anti-avoidance, rules-based
  • Dutch: Investment facilitation, OECD-aligned
  • Both: Modified by BEPS developments

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Over-focusing on US/Dutch details | Level 1 topic - awareness only needed | Provide brief context, don't elaborate extensively |
| Confusing LOB with PPT | Different anti-abuse mechanisms | LOB = rules-based (US); PPT = standards-based (OECD) |
| Ignoring US citizenship taxation | Key to understanding saving clause | Note US taxes citizens worldwide regardless of residence |
| Treating Dutch Model as unique | Closely follows OECD | Emphasize OECD alignment with minor variations |
