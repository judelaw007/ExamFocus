# Chapter 11.4: Royalties – Article 12, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Policy Rationale

### 1.1. The Role of Article 12

Article 12 allocates taxing rights over royalty income between the source state (where the payer is resident) and the residence state (where the beneficial owner is resident). Unlike Articles 10 and 11 which provide shared allocation with limited source taxation, the OECD Model establishes exclusive residence state taxation for royalties—representing the most significant difference between OECD treatment of passive income categories.

Royalties represent payments for the use of, or the right to use, intellectual property including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and know-how. The income arises from licensing arrangements where the owner permits another party to exploit the intellectual property in return for periodic payments. This distinguishes royalties from outright sales of intellectual property, which would generate capital gains under Article 13.

### 1.2. Policy Rationale for Exclusive Residence Taxation

The OECD Model's exclusive residence state taxation for royalties reflects several policy considerations. Research and development typically occurs in developed countries where intellectual property owners are resident, and these countries sought to preserve full taxing rights over the returns on that investment. Source state withholding was seen as creating double taxation burdens that could discourage technology transfer and licensing to developing countries.

The 1963 OECD Model adopted exclusive residence taxation, departing from earlier League of Nations approaches that permitted source taxation. This represented a policy choice favouring capital-exporting developed countries whose residents predominantly own intellectual property generating royalty income. The choice remains controversial, with the UN Model taking a fundamentally different approach permitting source taxation.

### 1.3. Comparison with Articles 10 and 11

Article 12's exclusive residence taxation contrasts sharply with Articles 10 and 11. Dividends under Article 10 are subject to limited source withholding at five or fifteen percent depending on the shareholding level. Interest under Article 11 is subject to limited source withholding at ten percent. Both provisions represent shared allocation between source and residence states.

Royalties under the OECD Model receive exclusive residence treatment with no source taxation permitted. This hierarchy—dividends with highest source taxation, interest with moderate source taxation, royalties with no source taxation—reflects policy judgments about the appropriate balance of taxing rights for different passive income categories.

## 2. Treaty Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 12(1): Exclusive Residence Taxation

Article 12(1) provides: "Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State."

The language "shall be taxable only" establishes exclusive residence state taxation—a closed rule that entirely precludes source state taxation. This differs fundamentally from Articles 10 and 11 which use "may be taxed" language permitting both states to tax subject to rate limitations. Under Article 12, the source state has no taxing rights over royalties paid to beneficial owners resident in the other Contracting State.

### 2.2. Article 12(2): Permanent Establishment Exception

Article 12(2) provides that if the beneficial owner has a permanent establishment in the source state and the right or property generating the royalty is effectively connected with that PE, Article 12 does not apply. Instead, Article 7 governs and the royalty is treated as business profits attributable to the PE.

Effective connection requires genuine business nexus between the intellectual property and the PE's activities. The PE must exercise functions related to the intellectual property—merely recording the asset in PE accounts is insufficient. When effectively connected, the source state may tax the royalty as part of PE business profits at full corporate rates.

### 2.3. Article 12(3): Definition

Article 12(3) defines royalties for treaty purposes, using a broad formulation covering payments for the use of, or right to use, patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs, plans, secret formulas or processes, and industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment. The definition also covers information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience—commonly termed know-how.

## 3. Definition of Royalties

### 3.1. Treaty Definition

Article 12(3) provides: "The term 'royalties' as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience."

This broad definition encompasses payments for both legal rights and practical knowledge. The definition requires payments for "use of, or the right to use" the specified property—distinguishing royalties from outright purchases of intellectual property.

### 3.2. Categories of Royalties

Royalties divide into several categories based on the underlying intellectual property. Patent royalties arise from licensing inventions and technical innovations. Copyright royalties arise from licensing literary, artistic, or scientific works including software and films. Trademark royalties arise from licensing brand names and commercial identifiers. Know-how royalties arise from licensing practical knowledge and experience not protected by formal intellectual property rights.

The distinction between know-how and technical services is particularly important. Know-how involves transfer of information that becomes the recipient's property to use independently. Technical services involve the provider applying their knowledge to perform work for the recipient without transfer of that knowledge. This characterisation affects whether payments fall under Article 12 or Article 7.

### 3.3. Equipment Royalties

The reference to industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment creates potential overlap with operating lease payments under Article 7. The Commentary clarifies that equipment royalties typically involve payments for use of specialised equipment where the payment represents consideration for intellectual property embedded in the equipment design rather than mere rental of physical assets.

Some countries have reserved their position on including equipment rentals in the royalty definition, preferring to treat such payments as business profits under Article 7. The distinction between equipment royalties and equipment rentals depends on whether payments are made for the intellectual property content of the equipment or merely for physical use of the equipment itself. Where specialised industrial machinery incorporates proprietary technology, payments may have hybrid characteristics requiring careful analysis of the predominant element.

## 4. The Beneficial Owner Requirement

### 4.1. Purpose and Function

The beneficial owner requirement in Article 12(1) serves the same anti-treaty shopping function as in Articles 10 and 11. Without this requirement, third-country residents could interpose entities in Contracting States to receive royalties and claim exclusive residence treatment, eliminating source taxation even where the ultimate recipient has no treaty entitlement.

The Commentary clarifies that beneficial owner has an international fiscal meaning requiring the recipient to have the right to use and enjoy the royalty without contractual or legal obligation to pass the payment to another person. Agents, nominees, and conduit companies with limited powers fail the beneficial ownership test.

### 4.2. Conduit Arrangements

Back-to-back licensing arrangements present particular beneficial ownership challenges. Where Company A licenses intellectual property to Company B, which sub-licenses to Company C on matching terms, Company B may fail the beneficial ownership test if it has no genuine economic stake in the licensing arrangement. French courts have held that a Dutch company receiving sub-licensing royalties and transferring more than eighty-eight percent to its parent was not the beneficial owner due to notably limited authority to use and allocate the funds.

The Danish Supreme Court decisions on beneficial ownership have established that recipients must economically benefit from payments and have genuine freedom to use and enjoy the royalties received. Conduit companies interposed solely to access treaty benefits without adding economic value will be denied treaty protection. These principles apply equally to Articles 10, 11, and 12, with courts increasingly applying substance-over-form analysis to identify arrangements designed primarily to obtain treaty benefits.

## 5. Permanent Establishment Exception

### 5.1. Article 12(2) Operation

Article 12(2) provides that where the beneficial owner has a PE in the source state and the right or property generating the royalty is effectively connected with that PE, Article 12 does not apply. Instead, Article 7 governs.

This exception applies where a licensing company has established a PE in the source state through which it manages the licensed intellectual property. In such cases, the royalty income is attributable to the PE and taxable as business profits rather than receiving exclusive residence treatment under Article 12.

### 5.2. Effective Connection Test

Effective connection requires more than technical allocation of the intellectual property to the PE. There must be genuine functional connection—the PE must perform significant activities related to developing, maintaining, or exploiting the intellectual property. When effectively connected, the source state gains full taxing rights over the royalty as part of PE profits.

## 6. UN Model Differences

### 6.1. Fundamental Divergence

The UN Model differs fundamentally from the OECD Model on royalties. UN Article 12(1) provides that royalties may be taxed in the residence state, while UN Article 12(2) permits the source state to also tax royalties, subject to a negotiated rate limitation.

This shared allocation approach mirrors UN treatment of dividends and interest, reflecting developing country concerns that exclusive residence taxation transfers revenue from source countries (typically developing, where intellectual property is exploited) to residence countries (typically developed, where intellectual property owners reside).

### 6.2. The 2025 UN Model Update

The 2025 UN Model update introduced significant changes to royalty taxation. The definition of royalties was expanded to explicitly include payments for software, including payments that do not relate to use of copyright in the software. This directly addresses digital economy challenges and diverges from the OECD's narrower approach treating most software payments as business profits.

The update also introduced Article 12AA on services, replacing former Article 12A (technical services) and Article 14 (independent personal services). Article 12AA applies to payments for any service, allowing source countries to impose withholding tax on gross service fees regardless of where services are performed. This represents substantial expansion of source taxing rights.

### 6.3. Article 12B – Automated Digital Services

The UN Model includes Article 12B addressing income from automated digital services—services provided over the internet or electronic network requiring minimal human involvement. This covers online advertising, digital content services, social media platforms, and standardised online teaching services. Article 12B permits source country withholding without requiring a permanent establishment, recognising that digital business models can generate substantial revenue in source countries without traditional physical presence.

## 7. Software Payments Characterisation

### 7.1. The Central Debate

Software payment characterisation represents one of the most contested issues in international taxation. The debate centres on whether payments for software constitute royalties under Article 12 or business profits under Article 7—with significant tax consequences depending on classification.

Under Article 7, business profits are taxable only in the residence state unless the enterprise has a PE in the source state. Under Article 12 OECD, royalties are exclusively taxable in the residence state. Under Article 12 UN, source taxation is permitted. The distinction matters most when comparing OECD treatment (no source taxation either way) with UN or domestic treatment permitting source withholding.

### 7.2. OECD Rights-Based Approach

The OECD endorses a rights-based approach distinguishing between payments for use of copyright (royalties) and payments for copyrighted products (business profits). Payments for the right to reproduce, adapt, or distribute software constitute royalties because they involve exploitation of copyright. Payments for mere use of software without any copyright exploitation—such as end-user licences for off-the-shelf software—constitute business profits.

The Commentary paragraph 14.1 provides that distributors acquiring rights to distribute software copies with only limited copyright do not receive royalties, provided they do not reproduce the software. This narrow approach generally treats commercial software purchases as business profits rather than royalties.

### 7.3. UN and National Divergence

The 2025 UN Model explicitly expanded the royalty definition to include software payments even where no copyright exploitation occurs. This directly contradicts the OECD rights-based approach and allows source countries to impose withholding tax on a broader range of software transactions.

National tax authorities have adopted varying positions. The Australian Tax Office's draft ruling TR 2024/D1 takes an expansive view, potentially treating SaaS subscription fees as royalties. This position has attracted international criticism as inconsistent with OECD standards, with the United States Department of Treasury expressing concern that the Australian interpretation conflicts with treaty terms. Thailand's March 2025 ruling aligned with the OECD approach, treating cloud computing and custom software development payments as business profits where no copyright exploitation was granted.

The characterisation of software payments has significant practical consequences for taxpayers and tax administrations. Where payments are characterised as royalties under treaties permitting source taxation, withholding obligations arise requiring compliance systems and potential double taxation relief claims. Where payments are characterised as business profits, no source taxation occurs absent a permanent establishment, simplifying cross-border transactions but potentially leaving source countries without revenue from significant digital economy activity within their borders. This tension between administrative simplicity and revenue protection drives ongoing policy debate and explains the OECD-UN divergence on this issue.

## 8. Key States' Approaches

### 8.1. United States

The United States imposes thirty percent withholding tax on royalties paid to non-residents under domestic law, with reduced rates available through tax treaties. The US has terminated its tax treaty with Russia effective January 2024 and partially suspended its treaty with Belarus effective December 2024, affecting royalty withholding obligations for payments to those jurisdictions.

### 8.2. United Kingdom

The United Kingdom imposes twenty percent withholding tax on royalties arising in the UK, covering payments for patents, copyrights, designs, trademarks, and know-how. Film and equipment royalties are generally exempt from UK withholding. Following Brexit, the EU Interest and Royalties Directive no longer applies to UK payments, requiring reliance on bilateral treaties for reduced rates.

The UK-Luxembourg treaty effective January 2024 reduced the royalty withholding rate from five percent to zero. However, the UK-Singapore treaty maintains an eight percent rate, creating competitive disadvantage compared to jurisdictions with zero-rate treaties with Singapore.

### 8.3. Germany

Germany imposes 15.825 percent withholding tax (including solidarity surcharge) on patent royalties and certain copyright royalties paid to non-resident companies. Under the EU Interest and Royalties Directive, payments to associated EU companies with twenty-five percent shareholding are exempt from German withholding.

### 8.4. France

France applies domestic withholding rates to royalties with the EU Interest and Royalties Directive providing exemption for payments to qualifying EU companies meeting five conditions including French residence of the payer, EU residence of the beneficial owner, and subjection to corporate income tax without exemption.

## 9. Recent Developments

### 9.1. Korean Supreme Court (September 2025)

The Korean Supreme Court's September 2025 decision on unregistered foreign patents marked a landmark development. Overturning thirty years of precedent, the Court held that royalties for use of unregistered patent technology constitute Korean-source income subject to withholding tax if the patent technology is used in Korea. The Court emphasised that "use" refers to use of underlying technology and methods, not formal exercise of registered patent rights.

### 9.2. Australian Case Law

The Australian PepsiCo case addressed embedded royalties in product payments. The Full Federal Court ruled that concentrate payments did not include a royalty component, establishing new tests for identifying embedded royalties in commercial arrangements. The Australian Tax Office deferred finalisation of TR 2024/D1 pending ultimate resolution of this case, which the High Court heard in April 2025.

### 9.3. BEPS Subject to Tax Rule

The BEPS Subject to Tax Rule establishes a nine percent minimum rate on cross-border royalty payments. Where the residence country's nominal tax rate falls below nine percent, the source country gains taxing rights for the difference. The STTR Multilateral Instrument was signed by initial jurisdictions in September 2024, providing a mechanism for implementing this minimum standard through bilateral treaty modifications.

### 9.4. Digital Services Tax Developments

Digital services taxes continue to proliferate despite discussions regarding Pillar One implementation. The United States withdrew from the OECD Inclusive Framework in January 2025, effectively stalling Pillar One negotiations. India abolished its equalisation levies during 2024-2025, with the six percent levy on online advertisements ending April 2025 and the two percent levy on e-commerce ending August 2024.

### 9.5. EU Interest and Royalties Directive

The EU Interest and Royalties Directive remains in force with beneficial ownership requirements increasingly scrutinised. A pending CJEU case (C-828/24) from the Czech Republic addresses whether the Directive permits retroactive tax exemptions and the time limits for claiming such exemptions. Danish Supreme Court decisions have confirmed that beneficial owners must economically benefit from payments and have freedom to use and enjoy royalties received.
