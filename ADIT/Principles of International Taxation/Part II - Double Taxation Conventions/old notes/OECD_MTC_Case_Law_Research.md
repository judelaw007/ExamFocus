## 1. KEY CASES ON OECD COMMENTARY INTERPRETATION

### 1.1 Alta Energy Luxembourg v The Queen (Canada, 2021)

**Citation:** Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49

**Jurisdiction:** Supreme Court of Canada

**Key Issue:** Static vs. ambulatory approach to OECD Commentary interpretation

#### Facts and Background
- Alta Energy involved a Luxembourg entity claiming benefits under the Canada-Luxembourg tax treaty (1999)
- The Crown argued that 2003 revisions to the OECD Commentary on Article 1 should apply to interpret the treaty
- The 2003 Commentary changes addressed the relationship between tax treaties and domestic anti-avoidance rules

#### Court's Holding on Static vs. Ambulatory Approach

The Supreme Court adopted a **largely static approach**, holding that:

> "In the interpretation of art. 1 of the Treaty, Commentaries on art. 1 of the OECD Model Treaty that postdate the Treaty cannot be relied on to introduce terms that modify the Treaty. Not only would this effectively amend the Treaty in a manner not agreed upon by the parties, but it would also usurp the role of the Governor in Council by allowing for judicial amendment of bilateral treaties."

#### Key Principles Established

**1. Timing Matters:**
- The 2003 Commentaries were revised after the signing of the 1999 Treaty
- The Court found that revisions subsequent to treaty negotiation "do not reflect the intentions of the drafters of the treaty"
- In this case, the later Commentary "contradicted the views previously expressed"

**2. Limited Role for Subsequent Commentaries:**
- Model treaty commentaries issued after a treaty has been negotiated may assist in determining the parties' intention
- **BUT** only if they:
  - Expand upon or clarify concepts already found in the earlier applicable OECD model treaty
  - Do not "extend the scope of provisions in a manner that could not have been considered by the drafters"

**3. The Importance of Reservations and Observations:**
- Luxembourg had registered an observation disagreeing with the 2003 Commentary
- Luxembourg stated it "does not share the interpretation... which provide that there is generally no conflict between anti-abuse provisions of the domestic law of a Contracting State and the provisions of its tax conventions"
- Interpreting the Treaty with reference to the 2003 Commentaries would overlook this registered observation

#### Significance
- The issue of when and to what extent subsequent commentaries are probative is important but rarely addressed in a judicial setting
- The majority do not dismiss outright the possible significance of later commentaries and other collateral guidance
- However, they are suitably cautious, given the contractual nature of treaties and the importance of knowing what the treaty partners had in mind when striking their bargain
- The extensive revisions made to the Commentaries in 2003 were described as being "created out of thin air by the OECD in 2003" and as "a significant change in the stated attitude of the OECD"

### 1.2 Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA (UK, 2006)

**Citation:** [2006] EWCA Civ 158

**Jurisdiction:** England and Wales Court of Appeal

**Key Issue:** Interpretation of "beneficial owner" using OECD Commentary

#### Background
- Indofood, an Indonesian trading group, issued bonds through a Mauritian SPV to reduce Indonesian withholding tax from 20% to 10% under the Indonesia-Mauritius DTA
- Indonesia subsequently terminated its DTA with Mauritius, increasing the WHT to 20%
- The case involved interpretation of "beneficial ownership" for treaty purposes

#### Court's Approach to OECD Commentary

**1. International Fiscal Meaning:**
The Court held that "the term 'beneficial owner' is to be given an international fiscal meaning not derived from the domestic laws of contracting states."

**2. Application of OECD Commentary:**
Paragraph 9 of the Commentary to Article 11 of the OECD Model explains that:
- The term "beneficial owner" is not used in a narrow technical sense
- It should be understood in its context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty
- Its meaning includes avoiding double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion and avoidance
- Its meaning is not limited to the meaning it might have under domestic law

**3. OECD Conduit Company Report:**
The court quoted the OECD report "Double Tax Convention and the Use of Conduit Companies":
> "A conduit company can normally not be regarded as the beneficial owner if, though the formal owner of certain assets, it has very narrow powers which render it a mere fiduciary or an administrator acting on account of the interested parties."

#### Test Applied
Under an "international fiscal meaning," beneficial ownership is determined by reference to a test which requires that the recipient "enjoy the full privilege to directly benefit from the income." Where recipients are bound in legal, commercial or practical terms to pass on the income, they will not be the beneficial owner.

#### Decision
The Court found unanimously that the Mauritian issuer was not the beneficial owner because:
- The timing of cash flows was tight with no profit or "spread"
- The position equated to that "of an administrator of the income"
- In practical terms it was impossible to conceive of circumstances in which the issuer could derive any "direct benefit" from the interest

#### Significance for UK Practice
- Following Indofood, UK tax authorities developed guidance on "beneficial owner" requirements
- The case established that there is no statutory definition in UK law but a considerable body of case law
- It represents the first extensive discussion of beneficial ownership in a UK court

### 1.3 Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (Australia, 1990)

**Citation:** (1990) 171 CLR 338

**Jurisdiction:** High Court of Australia

**Key Issue:** Relevance of OECD Commentary to interpretation of Double Taxation Agreements

#### Key Holdings

**1. OECD Commentary as Relevant Interpretive Aid:**
The High Court accepted that the OECD Model Tax Convention official Commentaries may be relevant to the interpretation of Double Tax Agreements based on the OECD Model Tax Convention.

**2. Vienna Convention Framework:**
The High Court approved recourse to the OECD Model and Commentaries under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.

#### Reasoning on Vienna Convention Application

**Article 31 Context:**
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides that a treaty is to be interpreted "in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose."

Justice Dawson stated:
> "I do not see why the OECD Model Convention and Commentaries should not be regarded as having been made in connection with and accepted by the parties to a bilateral treaty subsequently concluded in accordance with the framework of the Model."

**Article 32 Supplementary Means:**
While the OECD model convention and commentaries may not strictly amount to work preparatory to the double taxation agreement:
- They are documents which form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements
- They provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties
- They are therefore a supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT

#### Background of the Case
- The Swiss Agreement was one of several bilateral agreements concluded between Australia and other countries based on the 1977 OECD Model Convention
- The High Court held that the word 'profits' could not be held to have a domestic law meaning

#### Significance
- Thiel exemplified the appropriateness of reference to OECD commentary for assistance in the construction of a double taxation agreement
- It underscored the importance of the VCLT and recourse to supplementary means of interpretation
- The case has been followed internationally, including by the Supreme Court of India

---

### 1.4 Smallwood (UK)

**Jurisdiction:** United Kingdom

**Key Issue:** Ambulatory approach to treaty interpretation

#### Holding
The court held that "it would be unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena."

#### Approach
- The UK largely follows the ambulatory approach
- It is important to consider the purpose of the treaty and the relevant OECD Commentary
- Courts should then consider if the Commentary can apply to the facts at hand

#### Significance
This case represents the UK's general preference for an ambulatory approach, contrasting with more static approaches in other jurisdictions.

---

### 1.5 Commerzbank AG (UK)

**Jurisdiction:** United Kingdom

**Key Issue:** Status of OECD Commentaries and Vienna Convention interpretation

#### Holdings on Interpretation

**1. Vienna Convention as Primary Framework:**
The court held that DTAs should principally be interpreted based on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), focusing on the general rules of interpretation in Articles 31 and 32.

**2. Status of OECD Commentary:**
The Commerzbank court notably stated:
> "Subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."

**3. VCLT Principles:**
The court reasoned that because the treaty was not prepared by English drafters, it should be interpreted using broad, generally accepted principles under the VCLT.

#### Significance
- Foundational UK authority establishing that tax treaties should be interpreted according to Vienna Convention principles
- OECD Commentaries serve as persuasive but non-binding supplementary aids to interpretation
- The guidance in the Commentaries is clearly not binding on national courts, even the courts of OECD member countries

---

## 2. VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES (VCLT) APPLICATION

### 2.1 General Principles - Articles 31 and 32

#### Article 31: General Rule of Interpretation

**Text:** Article 31(1) VCLT establishes that "a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose."

**Additional Considerations under Article 31:**
- Subsequent agreements by the treaty parties
- Subsequent practices that reveal the parties' agreement on interpretive issues
- Any relevant rules of international law

**Important Note:** Neither Article 31 nor Article 32 prescribes the weight to be given to the text, context, or purpose of a treaty in any particular case.

#### Article 32: Supplementary Means of Interpretation

Article 32 provides additional rules of interpretation, which allow for the use of supplementary materials such as:
- Negotiating history of the treaty (travaux préparatoires)
- Other preparatory work

---

### 2.2 OECD Commentary Status Under the Vienna Convention

#### The Categorization Problem

The question of how the OECD Commentary fits within the terms of the Vienna Convention is significant. The Vienna Convention refers to various extrinsic material that can be looked to for the interpretation of treaties, but the OECD Commentary does not fit very happily into any of those categories.

#### Possible Classifications

**1. As Travaux Préparatoires (Article 32):**
- The status of the OECD model and commentaries as supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 is highly contentious
- They can be categorized as travaux préparatoires under VCLT Article 32, **provided** they were part of the preparatory work during the treaty negotiation

**2. As Supplementary Means:**
Some scholars argue the OECD Model and Commentaries can qualify under Article 32 VCLT as supplementary means of interpretation, provided that the treaty provision in question is based on the OECD Model.

#### Judicial Treatment

**High Court of Australia (Thiel):**
These documents "form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements" and "provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties."

**UK Courts (Commerzbank):**
The commentaries only have persuasive value and are not a substitute for the terms of conventions.

**United States:**
While the United States is not a signatory to the Vienna Convention, "it is the policy of the United States to [treat] articles 31 and 32 as customary international law."

---

### 2.3 Earlier vs. Later OECD Commentaries

#### The Temporal Distinction

**Earlier OECD Commentaries:**
- Can be decisive for interpreting a tax treaty provision if the wording of the provision follows the wording of the relevant OECD model provision closely
- Have stronger interpretive weight as they may reflect the understanding at the time of treaty negotiation

**Later OECD Commentaries:**
- Only have the status of a supplementary means of interpretation within the meaning of Article 32 VCLT
- Their use is more controversial and subject to the static vs. ambulatory debate

---

### 2.4 Country-Specific VCLT Applications

#### United Kingdom
- DTAs should be interpreted based on the VCLT
- Focus on the general rules of interpretation in Articles 31 and 32
- OECD Commentary may be used to confirm the ordinary meaning of terms or provide meaning where the general rule produces ambiguous or obscure results

#### United States
- Treats Articles 31 and 32 as customary international law despite not being a VCLT signatory
- U.S. courts have relied heavily upon OECD commentaries
- However, Treasury Technical Explanations take precedence over OECD Commentary

#### Australia (Thiel)
- OECD Model and Commentaries are supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32
- They form the basis for conclusion of bilateral DTAs and guide current usage of terms

---

## 3. STATIC VS. AMBULATORY INTERPRETATION DEBATE

### 3.1 Definitions

#### Static Approach
Under the static interpretation approach:
- The ordinary meaning of a rule of treaty is attributed when the treaty is concluded
- A DTA may only be interpreted by reference to OECD Commentary that was published on or before the date the DTA was signed
- Focuses on the intentions of the drafters at the time of treaty negotiation

#### Ambulatory Approach
Under the ambulatory interpretation approach:
- Adopts the current meaning of terms used in the treaty
- Later amendments to the Commentary after the treaty date may be considered
- Allows treaties to evolve with international tax developments

---

### 3.2 OECD's Position

The OECD itself essentially advocates for the **ambulatory approach**:

**Key Provisions:**
Paragraphs 33 to 36.1 of the introduction to the model treaty and the commentaries encourage both tax authorities and taxpayers to consider the **latest version** of the OECD model and its commentaries as the relevant point of inquiry when interpreting treaties.

**Important Caveat:**
No provision in the OECD Model Convention indicates a preference for either the static or the ambulatory approach to the use of Commentaries in the interpretation of tax treaties.

**Article 3(2) Clarification:**
In reference to Article 3, paragraph 2 of the OECD Model, it has been clarified by changes in the 1992 Commentaries and in the 1995 Model that an ambulatory approach to domestic law is preferred.

---

### 3.3 Country Approaches

#### United Kingdom - Ambulatory
The UK largely follows the ambulatory approach.

**Smallwood case:**
- "It would be unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena"
- Important to consider the purpose of the treaty and the relevant Commentary
- Then consider if the Commentary can apply

**Fowler v HMRC (20 May 2020):**
UK Supreme Court held that OECD commentaries which post-date a particular double tax treaty should be given consideration in interpretation.

#### Germany - Static
Germany's Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) does **not** take into account OECD commentaries published after the adoption of the relevant double tax treaty.

**BFH Decision (5 December 2023, published 2 May 2024):**
- Ruled that a version of the OECD commentary that did not exist before the Treaty came into force cannot be relied on
- This contradicts the official views of the German tax authorities
- Clarifies Germany's static approach to treaty interpretation

#### Spain - Static
Spain's Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that OECD commentaries "cannot be applied retroactively."

#### Netherlands - Mixed/Case-by-Case
National judiciaries are unclear, ranging from "later versions we only read for fun" to faithful ambulatory application.

**Amsterdam Appeal Court ("Limited Dynamic Interpretation"):**
- Commentary to the OECD model tax convention of 2010 would not necessarily be "of great relevance" because the text of the relevant treaty provision had changed
- Referenced what it called the "limited dynamic interpretation"
- Referred to Dutch Supreme Court case (Hoge Raad 9 December 1998, nr. 32.709, BNB 1999/267)

**Expected Supreme Court Decision:**
A case is pending before the Dutch Supreme Court expected to set the stage for a principled decision on how to deal with changes to OECD model tax convention provisions and OECD commentaries published after a treaty was concluded.

#### United States - Generally Ambulatory
U.S. courts have generally followed the ambulatory approach, applying the commentaries currently in effect.

**However:**
- Because U.S. treaties are patterned on the U.S. Model, not the OECD Model, the IRS and Treasury view the OECD Commentary as non-binding interpretive and background material
- Treasury Technical Explanations take precedence

**Taisei Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (104 T.C. 558):**
The court "effectively adopt[ed] the interpretation supplied by later commentaries, which conflicted with the interpretation of the commentaries at the time the treaty went into effect."

#### Canada - Static (Alta Energy)
Following Alta Energy (2021 SCC 49), Canada has adopted a predominantly static approach:
- Commentaries that postdate the Treaty cannot introduce terms that modify the Treaty
- Later commentaries may assist only if they expand upon or clarify concepts already found in the earlier applicable model
- They cannot extend the scope of provisions in a manner that could not have been considered by the drafters

---

### 3.4 Academic Perspectives

#### General Academic Position
Since many years, international tax law experts debate the relevance of changes to OECD Commentaries for the purpose of the interpretation of previously concluded tax treaties.

**Consensus View:**
Although, generally, most experts seem averse to the idea of an ambulatory approach to the usage of OECD Commentaries, they are reluctant to exclude this idea altogether.

#### Conditional Acceptance
Amendments to OECD Commentaries adopted after the ratification of a tax treaty may be considered in exceptional cases only. An ambulatory approach to the Commentaries can be accepted only when:
- There is evidence in OECD reports or draft documents that the post-treaty amendment was already available to treaty negotiators
- The amendment genuinely clarifies rather than changes the original interpretation

#### Case-by-Case Approach (Linderfalk & Hilling, 2015)
**Key Scholarly Position:**
No choices between a static or an ambulatory approach can be made other than relative to particular cases, based on an overall assessment taking all applicable factors into account.

**Contrast with Practitioner Views:**
This conclusion contrasts with the position of many international tax law experts, who argue that such choices can be dealt with conclusively by the adoption of some general principle.

**Significance:** The update reflects the latest developments in international taxation and offers enhanced guidance for the interpretation and application of tax treaties.

#### Key Changes in the 2025 Update

**1. Remote Working Guidance (Article 5 Commentary)**

**Background:**
- Necessitated by significant growth in employees working remotely across borders since the last updates to the MTC in 2017
- Addresses when an employee's home or another location unconnected to the employer in a different country could create a 'fixed place of business' permanent establishment (PE)

**Key Principle:**
Simply working from home or another location in a different country does **not** automatically create a fixed place of business PE for the employer. The facts and circumstances of each case are critical.

**2. Natural Resources Provision**

**Introduction:**
An optional standard provision on activities in connection with the exploration and exploitation of extractable natural resources, adopted by the OECD Council in April 2025.

**Location:** Explained in paragraphs 170 to 203 of the Commentary on Article 5

**Purpose:**
- Enlarges the taxing rights of source States
- Introduces a lower PE threshold based on a bilaterally agreed minimum time period
- Particularly relevant for developing countries

**3. Article 9 (Associated Enterprises)**

**Changes:**
The 2025 Update clarifies the application of Article 9 in relation to domestic interest deductibility rules, including those recommended in the final report on BEPS Action 4.

**Replacement:** Paragraphs 1 to 6 of the Commentary on Article 9 have been replaced

**Significance:**
Acknowledges that countries may differ on applying this article to assess the balance of debt and equity funding within multinational groups.

**4. Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedures) - Amount B Changes**

**Background:**
Changes related to OECD Pillar One's Amount B, adopted by the OECD Council in 2024

**Purpose:**
- Signpost specific language relating to tax certainty and the elimination of double taxation
- Ensure that optionality is preserved in all dispute resolution mechanisms for non-adopting jurisdictions

---

### 4.4 Notable Court Decisions (2022-2024)

#### Germany - Partners in International Law Firms (2023)

**Citation:** Bundesfinanzhof (BFH), 5 December 2023 (I R 42/20), published 2 May 2024

**Issue:**
Taxation of guaranteed payments from a U.S. law firm to its German partners under the U.S.-Germany income tax treaty

**Holding:**
- Certain guaranteed payments are exempt from German income tax to the extent they are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment
- Rejected argument based on OECD commentary that did not exist before the Treaty came into force

**Significance:**
- Clarifies the tax treatment of partners in international law firms
- Contradicts official views of German tax authorities on treaty interpretation (static vs. dynamic approaches)
- Reinforces Germany's static approach

#### India - Delhi High Court PE Decisions (2024)

**PE as Separate Entity:**
A full bench of the Delhi High Court reversed an earlier decision to hold that:
- A permanent establishment must be viewed as a separate taxable entity
- Its profits must be assessed independently, without considering the overall financial performance of the enterprise

**Tiger Global International:**
Delhi High Court reinforced:
- The importance of a tax residency certificate (TRC) for establishing tax residency
- Capital gains from the sale of shares were not taxable in India since the transaction was not aimed at tax avoidance
- The need for a balanced approach in evaluating commercial substance and beneficial ownership of entities claiming tax treaty benefits

#### Australia-India Resolution (2022)
A major double taxation problem for Indian industry was ultimately resolved in 2022 by an agreement reached between Australia and India in the context of concluding a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA), leading to an important change in Australian tax law.

---

### 4.5 Treaty Network Changes (2022-2024)

#### New Treaties
- **19 December 2023:** United States and Chile entered into a tax treaty, effective for withholding taxes on payments made on or after 1 February 2024

#### Terminations and Suspensions
- **8 July 2022:** United States terminated the income tax treaty with Hungary
- **1 July 2024:** United States provided formal notice to the Russian Federation confirming suspension of key treaty provisions

---

## 5. RESERVATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS

### 5.1 Definition and Purpose

#### Observations
- Do **not** express any disagreement with the text of the Convention
- Usefully indicate the way in which those countries will apply the provisions of the Article in question
- Do **not** express any disagreement with the text of the commentary
- Indicate the way in which the particular country will apply the provisions of the treaty article

#### Reservations
- Made in respect of the article where a particular country cannot agree the OECD commentary interpretation decided upon
- Usually indicate the country's alternative interpretation
- May relate to the text of the Convention itself or to the Commentary

### 5.2 Examples

#### Switzerland
Reserves the right not to include paragraph 3 in their conventions.

#### Various Countries
Some countries reserve the right to include definitions in subparagraphs concerning "enterprise" and "business" because they reserve the right to include an article concerning the taxation of independent personal services.

#### Luxembourg (Alta Energy Context)
Luxembourg stated it "does not share the interpretation... which provide that there is generally no conflict between anti-abuse provisions of the domestic law of a Contracting State and the provisions of its tax conventions."

### 5.3 Legal Status and Role

The book "Departures from the OECD Model and Commentaries" considers:
- The role and evolution of reservations, observations, positions and alternative provisions
- The legal status of these instruments
- Analysis of their relevance in treaty negotiations

**OECD Invitation:**
The OECD invites the Governments of Member countries to continue to notify the Committee on Fiscal Affairs of their reservations on the Articles and observations on the Commentaries.

**2025 Update:**
The 2025 Update includes the changes and additions made to the observations and reservations of OECD Member countries and the positions of non-Members.

---

## 6. LEGAL STATUS OF OECD COMMENTARY - SUMMARY

### 6.1 General Principles

**Non-Binding Nature:**
The OECD commentaries are highly valued in practice as a tool for treaty interpretation, despite the fact that — as paragraph 29 of the introduction to the model treaty and the commentaries notes — they are **not** a legally binding document.

**Court Practice:**
The guidance in the Commentaries is clearly not binding on national courts, even the courts of OECD member states. However, scholars and courts have taken the position that changes to the Commentary cannot be used to interpret tax treaties entered into before those changes were made.

### 6.2 OECD Recommendations

The OECD recommends that:
- Member states conclude bilateral tax conventions conforming to the Model Tax Convention and its Commentaries
- Tax administrations follow the Commentaries on the Articles of the Model Tax Convention, as modified from time to time, when applying and interpreting the provisions of their bilateral tax conventions based on these Articles

**Significance:**
The Commentaries have become a widely accepted guide to the interpretation and application of the provisions of bilateral conventions based on the Model Tax Convention.

### 6.3 Practical Value

**For Tax Officials:**
Tax officials give great weight to the guidance contained in the Commentaries. The Commentaries are useful both in deciding day-to-day questions of detail and in resolving larger issues involving the policies and purposes behind various provisions.

**Court Usage:**
- An increasingly wide range of courts have accepted the commentaries
- This includes courts in OECD member states (e.g., application of the Ivory Coast-Norway income tax treaty)
- As well as courts in non-OECD member states that have published their positions on the OECD model
- U.S. courts have relied heavily upon the commentaries as extrinsic sources of tax treaty interpretations

**UK Position (Commerzbank):**
Subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning.

### 6.4 The Ambulatory Problem

Complex issues arise involving the commentaries since they are ambulatory in nature. Because the commentaries are often restated or revised, courts must decide whether to apply the interpretation from the commentaries:
- In effect at the time of the treaty's negotiation
- At the time of the treaty's application
- At the time of the court's decision

This remains one of the most debated issues in international tax treaty interpretation.

---

## 7. U.S. APPROACH - TREASURY TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS

### 7.1 Status and Purpose

**Definition:**
Each U.S. treaty is accompanied by a Treasury-issued Technical Explanation ("TE") which serves as an official guide to the treaty's meaning.

**Official Status:**
"The Technical Explanation is an official guide to the Convention. It reflects the policies behind particular Convention provisions, as well as understandings reached with respect to the application and interpretation of the Convention."

### 7.2 Relationship to OECD Commentary

**Precedence:**
Because U.S. treaties are patterned on the U.S. Model, not the OECD Model, the IRS and Treasury view the OECD Commentary as non-binding interpretive and background material when a TE is silent or when both treaty partners expressly agree to follow OECD guidance.

**Express Statement in Technical Explanations:**
> "This technical explanation applies notwithstanding a different interpretation in the Commentary on the OECD Model, even where the interpretation in the OECD Model Commentary is adopted after the issuance of this technical explanation. The use of the OECD Commentary... can neither result in an amendment to the treaty as approved by the Senate and ratified, nor can it result in an interpretation contrary to the position of the United States."

**Limited Use of OECD Commentary:**
The OECD Commentaries "can be helpful... in providing explanations and interpretations of issues which arise during the life of the treaty."

### 7.3 Court Cases

**Pekar v. Comm'r (T.C. 158, 1999):**
Referred to the Technical Explanation to the U.S. Model Income Tax Treaty in interpreting the U.S.-Germany treaty.

**Taisei Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (104 T.C. 558):**
The court "effectively adopt[ed] the interpretation supplied by later commentaries, which conflicted with the interpretation of the commentaries at the time the treaty went into effect."

### 7.4 Model Treaties as Interpretive Guides

Although model treaties are not legally binding:
- Their language is often incorporated verbatim in bilateral treaties
- Therefore, commentaries and technical explanations that aid in the interpretation of a model treaty also may shed light on the meaning of a treaty based on the model
- "The strong identity between the provisions of the OECD and U.S. Models reflects the fact that the United States drew heavily on the work of the OECD in the development of the U.S. Model. References are made in the Technical Explanation to the OECD commentaries, where appropriate, to note similarities and differences."

   - It has persuasive value depending on the cogency of reasoning
   - Courts are not required to consult or consider the Commentaries

2. **Static vs. Ambulatory Debate:**
   - Understand both approaches and which countries follow which
   - Canada (Alta Energy): Static approach - later Commentary cannot modify treaty
   - UK: Generally ambulatory (Smallwood, Fowler)

   - **Indofood (UK 2006):** Beneficial ownership, international fiscal meaning
   - **Thiel (Australia 1990):** OECD Commentary as Article 32 supplementary means
   - **Commerzbank (UK):** VCLT framework, persuasive value only

7. **Practical Considerations:**
   - Later Commentary can only assist if it clarifies, not if it extends or modifies
   - The timing of Commentary relative to treaty negotiation matters
   - Country-specific reservations and observations must be considered
   - U.S. Technical Explanations take precedence over OECD Commentary for U.S. treaties
