## Chapter 18.1: The OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument – All Provisions

### 1. Introduction and Operational Framework

#### 1.1. Scope and Interpretation (Part I: Articles 1-2)

The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS comprises 39 articles organized into seven parts. Part I establishes the foundational framework through two critical provisions that govern the instrument's operation.

Article 1 defines the scope of the Convention, establishing that it modifies all Covered Tax Agreements (CTAs) as defined in Article 2. The term "Covered Tax Agreement" refers to bilateral tax treaties that both contracting jurisdictions have listed as agreements they wish the MLI to modify. This matching requirement is fundamental—a bilateral treaty is only modified if both parties have identified it as covered in their respective notifications to the OECD Depositary.

Article 2 provides interpretive guidance essential for understanding how MLI provisions interact with existing treaty texts. Crucially, Article 2(2) establishes that the MLI modifies rather than replaces existing treaties. The existing treaty provisions continue to exist; the MLI sits alongside them and modifies their application. This approach preserves the bilateral treaty network while achieving multilateral modification.

#### 1.2. The Four-Clause Architecture

Each substantive provision of the MLI typically contains four distinct clause types that work together to implement modifications:

**Operative clauses** contain the substantive rule to be applied. These clauses replicate or adapt provisions from the OECD Model Tax Convention or the BEPS Final Reports, representing the policy content the MLI seeks to implement.

**Compatibility clauses** define the relationship between MLI provisions and existing treaty provisions. Four formulations exist: provisions that apply "in place of" existing provisions (replacement), provisions that "apply to" or "modify" existing provisions (modification), provisions that apply "in the absence of" existing provisions (gap-filling), and provisions that apply "in place of or in the absence of" existing provisions (comprehensive).

**Reservation clauses** permit jurisdictions to exclude the application of specific provisions. The scope of permissible reservations varies by article—minimum standards permit no reservations on core requirements, while optional provisions may be entirely reserved against.

**Notification clauses** require jurisdictions to communicate their positions regarding the provision. Notifications identify which CTAs contain relevant existing provisions and specify which options a jurisdiction has chosen where alternatives exist.

#### 1.3. Matching Requirements and Symmetry

The MLI operates on principles of matching and symmetry. For any provision to modify a specific bilateral treaty, both parties to that treaty must have taken compatible positions. If one party reserves against a provision, that provision does not apply to the treaty relationship, regardless of the other party's position. This reciprocity ensures modifications occur only by mutual consent.

The matching requirement extends to CTA identification, optional provision adoption, and arbitration opt-in. The OECD's MLI Matching Database provides a tool for determining how the MLI affects specific bilateral relationships based on both parties' positions.

Understanding the practical operation of these matching requirements is essential for determining the actual effect of the MLI on any given bilateral treaty. Practitioners must examine both parties' MLI Positions—including their reservations, notifications, and optional provision choices—to determine which MLI provisions apply and how they modify the underlying treaty. The synthesized texts published by the OECD consolidate this analysis, showing the treaty as modified by the MLI.

### 2. Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements (Part II: Articles 3-5)

Part II addresses hybrid mismatch arrangements, implementing BEPS Action 2 recommendations to prevent structures that exploit differences between jurisdictions' characterization of entities or instruments.

#### 2.1. Article 3: Transparent Entities

Article 3 addresses income derived through entities or arrangements treated as fiscally transparent under the tax law of either contracting jurisdiction. The operative rule provides that treaty benefits shall be granted for such income only to the extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by a contracting jurisdiction, as the income of a resident of that jurisdiction.

This provision prevents situations where treaty benefits are claimed for income that neither jurisdiction treats as income of a resident. For example, where a partnership is treated as transparent in one jurisdiction but opaque in another, Article 3 ensures benefits are available only where at least one jurisdiction taxes the income as belonging to a resident.

Article 3 is an optional provision. Jurisdictions may reserve entirely against its application, and many have done so. India, for instance, has reserved the entirety of Article 3, meaning Indian CTAs are not modified by this provision.

#### 2.2. Article 4: Dual Resident Entities

Article 4 addresses the treaty residence of entities that would otherwise be resident in both contracting jurisdictions. Traditional tie-breaker rules in bilateral treaties typically resolve dual residence by reference to place of effective management alone. Article 4 replaces this mechanical test with a requirement that competent authorities determine residence by mutual agreement, considering place of effective management, place of incorporation, and any other relevant factors.

Where no agreement is reached, the dual resident entity is not entitled to treaty benefits except as the competent authorities may agree. This provision addresses concerns that the place of effective management test was being manipulated to achieve desired treaty residence outcomes.

#### 2.3. Article 5: Methods for Elimination of Double Taxation

Article 5 addresses double non-taxation arising when the residence state uses the exemption method to relieve double taxation but the source state does not actually tax the income. Three options are available:

**Option A** provides that exemption shall not apply where the source state applies treaty provisions to exempt income or tax dividends or interest at reduced rates. The residence state must instead provide credit relief.

**Option B** addresses cases where the source state exempts income under treaty provisions—the residence state must provide credit rather than exemption.

**Option C** contains a more comprehensive rule applying the credit method where the source state applies treaty provisions to exempt income or reduce tax on dividends, interest, or royalties.

The provision permits asymmetric application—each state's chosen option applies with respect to its own residents. Australia, which uses the credit method throughout its treaties, has not adopted Article 5 as its treaties do not contain the exemption provisions the article addresses.

### 3. Treaty Abuse Prevention (Part III: Articles 6-11)

Part III implements BEPS Action 6 recommendations addressing treaty abuse, particularly treaty shopping. Articles 6 and 7 represent minimum standards that all jurisdictions must implement.

#### 3.1. Articles 6-7: Preamble and Principal Purpose Test

Article 6 modifies treaty preambles to include language confirming that the treaty's purpose includes eliminating double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including treaty shopping. This preamble modification establishes interpretive context for all treaty provisions and cannot be reserved against.

Article 7 implements the principal purpose test (PPT) or equivalent anti-abuse provisions. The PPT denies treaty benefits where "it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction," unless granting the benefit would accord with the treaty's object and purpose. *(covered in December 2023)*

Jurisdictions may satisfy the minimum standard through:
- The PPT alone (the default and most common choice)
- A simplified limitation on benefits (SLOB) provision combined with anti-conduit rules
- A detailed LOB provision (requiring bilateral negotiation)

The PPT's subjective nature has prompted guidance in the OECD Commentary on its application. The test does not require that obtaining treaty benefits be the sole or dominant purpose—being one of the principal purposes is sufficient to trigger the rule.

#### 3.2. Article 8: Dividend Transfer Transactions

Article 8 introduces a 365-day minimum holding period for reduced withholding tax rates on dividends. Shares must be held throughout this period, calculated as 365 days including the day of payment, for the beneficial owner to qualify for reduced rates applicable to non-portfolio intercorporate dividends. This provision addresses arrangements where shares are acquired shortly before dividend payments to access favourable treaty rates.

#### 3.3. Article 9: Capital Gains from Immovable Property

Article 9 addresses capital gains from shares or interests in entities deriving their value principally from immovable property. It permits source state taxation where at any time during the 365 days preceding the disposal, the shares or interests derived more than 50 percent of their value from immovable property situated in that state.

This provision extends source state taxing rights to cover situations where entities were "land-rich" at any point during the preceding year, not merely at the moment of disposal. It prevents arrangements designed to dilute real property holdings immediately before disposal to avoid source taxation.

#### 3.4. Articles 10-11: Triangular PE and Taxing Own Residents

Article 10 addresses "triangular" permanent establishment cases where a third state PE of an enterprise resident in one contracting state derives income from the other contracting state. Where the residence state exempts PE profits and the PE is subject to low taxation in the third state, source state treaty benefits may be limited.

Article 11 confirms the saving clause principle—treaties do not restrict a contracting state's right to tax its own residents. This provision standardizes language appearing in various forms across existing treaties.

### 4. Permanent Establishment Provisions (Part IV: Articles 12-15)

Part IV implements BEPS Action 7 recommendations addressing artificial avoidance of permanent establishment (PE) status. Unlike Parts II and III, these provisions are entirely optional—jurisdictions may adopt all, some, or none.

#### 4.1. Article 12: Commissionnaire Arrangements

Article 12 targets commissionnaire and similar arrangements where an enterprise uses a related party to conclude contracts in another jurisdiction while claiming no PE exists because the related party acts in its own name. The provision expands the dependent agent PE definition to include persons habitually playing the principal role leading to contract conclusion, even where contracts are formally concluded elsewhere.

The provision replicates Article 5(5) and (6) of the 2017 OECD Model, extending PE attribution beyond cases where contracts are literally concluded by the agent to cases where the agent's activities are decisive in bringing contracts about.

#### 4.2. Article 13: Specific Activity Exemptions

Article 13 addresses the specific activity exemptions in Article 5(4) of the Model Tax Convention—activities like storage, display, purchasing, and information gathering that are excluded from PE status. BEPS concerns focused on whether these exemptions were being exploited through fragmentation strategies.

Three options are available:
- **Option A** requires all listed activities to be of a preparatory or auxiliary character to qualify for exemption
- **Option B** preserves existing exemptions but adds a general preparatory or auxiliary requirement
- Neither option (maintaining existing treaty language)

Article 13(4) provides an anti-fragmentation rule preventing related enterprises from splitting activities among themselves to claim each falls within an exemption.

#### 4.3. Articles 14-15: Contract Splitting and Closely Related Definition

Article 14 addresses contract splitting—arrangements where related enterprises divide contracts to keep each below time thresholds that would otherwise create a PE (such as the 12-month construction site rule). The provision aggregates time spent by closely related enterprises for threshold purposes.

Article 15 defines "closely related" for purposes of Articles 12, 13, and 14. The definition focuses on control relationships—direct or indirect possession of more than 50 percent of beneficial interests, or control of both enterprises by the same persons.

### 5. Dispute Resolution (Part V: Articles 16-17)

Part V implements BEPS Action 14 recommendations improving mutual agreement procedures.

#### 5.1. Article 16: Mutual Agreement Procedure

Article 16 strengthens the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) by implementing three key improvements constituting minimum standards:

First, taxpayers may present cases to the competent authority of either contracting state, not merely their state of residence. This addresses situations where residence state competent authorities might be less motivated to pursue relief.

Second, a three-year time limit applies for presenting cases, measured from first notification of the action giving rise to taxation not in accordance with the treaty. This standardizes limitation periods across treaties.

Third, no time limit applies to implementing agreements reached through MAP. This prevents domestic statutes of limitations from precluding relief even where competent authorities agree adjustments are warranted. *(covered in June 2024)*

#### 5.2. Article 17: Corresponding Adjustments

Article 17 requires contracting states to make corresponding adjustments to eliminate double taxation in transfer pricing cases. Where one state adjusts the profits of an enterprise under the arm's length principle, the other state must make a corresponding adjustment to the profits of the associated enterprise, provided the adjustment is justified.

The provision addresses situations where one state makes a primary adjustment but the other state does not provide correlative relief, leaving the enterprise group subject to double taxation on the adjusted amount.

### 6. Arbitration Framework (Part VI: Articles 18-26)

Part VI establishes mandatory binding arbitration for unresolved MAP cases. Unlike other parts, Part VI operates as an integrated whole—jurisdictions opting in adopt the entire framework, with limited scope for reservations.

#### 6.1. Triggering Arbitration (Articles 18-19)

Article 18 permits jurisdictions to opt into Part VI. Arbitration applies only where both parties to a CTA have opted in—the matching requirement is particularly strict for arbitration.

Article 19 establishes that unresolved issues shall be submitted to arbitration where a MAP case remains unresolved two years after commencement. The taxpayer triggers arbitration by written request to a competent authority. Cases commence on the later of (i) the end of the period for presenting cases under Article 16 or (ii) receipt by both competent authorities of all information required for substantive consideration.

#### 6.2. Types of Arbitration Process (Article 23)

Article 23 establishes the default arbitration type as "final offer" (or "baseball") arbitration, where each competent authority submits a proposed resolution and the arbitration panel selects one without modification. This approach encourages reasonable positions and limits arbitrator discretion.

Jurisdictions may alternatively choose "independent opinion" arbitration, where the panel issues a reasoned decision resolving the issues. Where parties have chosen different types, they must agree on which applies to their CTA—absent agreement, Article 19 does not apply to that relationship.

As of 2024, approximately 30 jurisdictions have adopted Part VI, enabling arbitration for treaty relationships where both parties have opted in. Many developing countries have declined, viewing binding arbitration as inconsistent with tax sovereignty. The concerns underlying this reluctance are substantial: developing countries often lack the resources and expertise to participate effectively in international arbitration proceedings, and fear that arbitrators drawn predominantly from developed country legal traditions may favour interpretations aligned with capital-exporting rather than capital-importing perspectives. The OECD's emphasis on voluntary adoption of Part VI acknowledges these concerns while maintaining arbitration as an option for jurisdictions prepared to accept its implications.

#### 6.3. Compatibility with Existing Provisions (Article 26)

Article 26 provides that Part VI applies in place of or in the absence of existing arbitration provisions. Where both parties adopt Part VI, the MLI arbitration framework supersedes any existing bilateral arbitration provisions.

### 7. Final Provisions (Part VII: Articles 27-39)

Part VII contains procedural provisions governing the Convention's operation.

#### 7.1. Reservations and Notifications (Articles 28-29)

Article 28 enumerates permissible reservations. Jurisdictions may not formulate reservations beyond those expressly authorized. Reservations apply symmetrically—where one party reserves against a provision, that provision does not modify the CTA in either direction.

Article 29 requires notifications specifying CTAs covered, existing provisions addressed, and options chosen. Notifications are deposited with the OECD and may be modified over time, with new notifications taking effect according to schedules specified in Article 35.

The combination of reservations and notifications constitutes each jurisdiction's "MLI Position," published by the OECD and essential for determining how the MLI affects specific bilateral relationships.

#### 7.2. Entry into Force and Effect (Articles 34-35)

Article 34 establishes that the Convention entered into force on 1 July 2018, following deposit of the fifth instrument of ratification. For subsequent jurisdictions, entry into force occurs on the first day of the month following expiration of three months from deposit.

Article 35 provides detailed rules for when MLI provisions take effect for specific CTAs. Generally, for withholding taxes, provisions take effect from the first day of the calendar year following the later entry into force date for the two parties. For other taxes, provisions take effect for taxable periods beginning on or after expiration of six months from that date.

Article 16 (MAP) follows a different schedule—it takes effect for cases presented on or after the later entry into force date, regardless of the taxable periods to which cases relate. This permits MAP access for older years where cases are presented after the MLI takes effect.

As of January 2025, 104 jurisdictions have signed the MLI, with 88 having deposited instruments of ratification. The instrument covers the modification of approximately 2,000 bilateral tax treaties. Notable absences include the United States, whose bilateral treaties must be addressed individually, and several jurisdictions that have signed but not yet ratified.
