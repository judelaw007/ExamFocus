## Chapter 12: Taxation of Capital – Article 22, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 22

Article 22 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) addresses the allocation of taxing rights over capital, completing the comprehensive framework that Articles 6 through 21 establish for income. While the preceding articles determine which state may tax various categories of income, Article 22 performs the same function for taxes imposed on capital itself—commonly referred to as wealth taxes, net worth taxes, or capital taxes.

The distinction between income and capital taxation is fundamental. Income taxes apply to periodic yields from capital—dividends, interest, rents, gains—while capital taxes apply to the underlying value of assets regardless of whether they produce current income. Countries that impose annual wealth taxes need treaty provisions to prevent double taxation of the same capital by both residence and situs states.

#### 1.2. Policy Rationale

The policy rationale underlying Article 22 mirrors that of the income allocation articles: preventing double taxation while ensuring that capital is taxed by at least one state with a legitimate connection to it. The article generally favours situs-based taxation for capital with a strong territorial connection—immovable property and business assets of permanent establishments—while preserving residence-state taxation for other capital.

This allocation reflects the economic reality that immovable property and permanent establishment assets are inextricably linked to the host state's economy. The host state provides infrastructure, legal protection, and the economic environment enabling these assets to maintain value. Accordingly, the host state retains taxing rights over such capital, consistent with its rights to tax the income derived from these assets under Articles 6 and 7.

For capital without such territorial connection—portfolio investments, personal movable property, intangibles—the residence state's comprehensive jurisdiction over its residents justifies exclusive taxing rights. This prevents situations where mobile capital faces taxation in multiple jurisdictions based on transient connections.

#### 1.3. Relationship to Income Articles

Article 22 deliberately parallels the structure of the income allocation articles. The Commentary notes that "it is normal to give the right to tax capital gains on a property of a given kind to the State which under the Convention is entitled to tax both the property and the income derived therefrom." This coherence ensures that the same connecting factors—situs for immovable property, permanent establishment for business assets, effective management for international transport—apply across income, gains, and capital taxation.

The parallel structure creates practical benefits for treaty application. Advisers need not analyse fundamentally different allocation rules for capital taxes—they can apply the familiar framework from income taxation with minor adaptations for capital-specific considerations.

### 2. The Text of Article 22

#### 2.1. OECD Model Article 22

Article 22 of the OECD MTC 2017 contains four paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1**: "Capital represented by immovable property referred to in Article 6, owned by a resident of a Contracting State and situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State."

**Paragraph 2**: "Capital represented by movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

**Paragraph 3**: "Capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates ships or aircraft in international traffic represented by such ships or aircraft, and by movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State."

**Paragraph 4**: "All other elements of capital of a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State."

#### 2.2. Structure and Logic

The article follows a systematic progression from most territorially connected capital to least. Paragraph 1 addresses immovable property—capital with the strongest territorial nexus. Paragraph 2 covers permanent establishment assets—movable property with a business connection to the other state. Paragraph 3 deals with international transport assets—a special case requiring uniform treatment. Paragraph 4 provides a residual rule for all other capital.

This structure ensures comprehensive coverage. Every element of capital owned by a treaty resident falls within exactly one paragraph, eliminating gaps and overlaps. The use of "may be taxed" in paragraphs 1 and 2 permits concurrent taxation (subject to elimination under Article 23), while "shall be taxable only" in paragraphs 3 and 4 grants exclusive rights.

### 3. Detailed Analysis of Each Paragraph

#### 3.1. Paragraph 1: Immovable Property

Paragraph 1 permits the situs state to tax capital represented by immovable property. The reference to "Article 6" incorporates that article's broad definition of immovable property, which includes land, buildings, accessories, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which private law provisions concerning land apply, usufruct of immovable property, and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for working or the right to work mineral deposits, sources, and other natural resources.

The phrase "may be taxed" indicates that both states retain taxing rights. The situs state may tax under paragraph 1, and the residence state may also tax under its general jurisdiction over residents' worldwide capital. Where both states exercise these rights, Article 23 requires the residence state to provide relief through credit or exemption.

The coherence with Article 6 (income from immovable property) and Article 13(1) (gains from immovable property) is deliberate. A residence state that has relinquished taxing rights over rental income and capital gains should not expect to tax the underlying capital without sharing that right with the situs state.

#### 3.2. Paragraph 2: Permanent Establishment Assets

Paragraph 2 permits the host state to tax capital represented by movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment. This covers machinery, equipment, inventory, receivables, and other business assets attributable to the permanent establishment.

The connection to Article 7 (business profits) and Article 13(2) (gains from permanent establishment assets) is parallel to paragraph 1's connection to Articles 6 and 13(1). The state that taxes the profits generated by business assets and the gains from their alienation may also tax the capital value of those assets.

The phrase "forming part of the business property" requires that assets be functionally connected to the permanent establishment's business activities. Passive investments held by the permanent establishment but not connected to its active business would not satisfy this requirement.

#### 3.3. Paragraph 3: International Transport Assets

Paragraph 3 provides exclusive residence-state taxation for capital represented by ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and pertaining movable property. The reference to "enterprise of a Contracting State" incorporates Article 8's rules for international transport.

The rationale for exclusive allocation mirrors Article 8's justification. International transport assets operate across multiple jurisdictions, making situs-based taxation impractical and potentially leading to excessive fragmentation of taxing rights. Exclusive allocation provides certainty and simplicity for enterprises whose assets move constantly between states.

The 2017 update made significant changes to paragraph 3, reflecting broader amendments to Article 8. Prior to 2017, paragraph 3 referred to capital being "taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated." The 2017 revision changed this to "taxable only in that State"—meaning the state of which the enterprise is a resident. This shift from "place of effective management" to "state of residence" aligns paragraph 3 with the restructured Article 8, which now allocates shipping and aviation profits to the enterprise's residence state rather than the state of effective management. The change ensures continued coherence between income, gains, and capital treatment for international transport operations.

#### 3.4. Paragraph 4: Residual Rule

Paragraph 4 grants exclusive taxing rights to the residence state for "all other elements of capital." This covers portfolio investments (shares, bonds, other securities), personal movable property (vehicles, art, jewellery), intangible property (intellectual property, goodwill), and any other capital not falling within paragraphs 1-3.

The exclusive allocation reflects several considerations. First, capital without territorial connection to the other state lacks the justification for source-state taxation. Second, the residence state has comprehensive jurisdiction over its residents and can effectively administer wealth taxes on worldwide assets. Third, exclusive allocation prevents double taxation without requiring relief mechanisms.

The phrase "all other elements" operates as a true residual, ensuring complete coverage. No capital owned by a treaty resident falls outside Article 22's scope.

### 4. Application of Wealth Taxes

#### 4.1. Countries Imposing Wealth Taxes

Article 22 is most relevant where at least one treaty partner imposes annual wealth taxes. Three European countries maintain comprehensive net wealth taxes as of 2025: Switzerland, Norway, and Spain. Each illustrates different approaches to wealth taxation that treaty provisions must accommodate.

Switzerland imposes wealth tax at the cantonal and communal levels, with no federal wealth tax. Thresholds typically start between CHF 77,000 and CHF 120,000 depending on the canton, with progressive rates generally ranging from 0.1% to around 1% on net assets above the exemption. Residents are taxed on worldwide assets excluding foreign real estate and permanent establishments abroad, while non-residents are taxed only on Swiss-situated assets.

Norway imposes wealth tax on residents' global net assets and on Norway-situated assets for non-residents. The individual threshold is approximately NOK 1.76 million, with combined rates of 1.0% on wealth up to NOK 20.7 million rising to 1.1% above that threshold.

Spain imposes wealth tax on residents' worldwide assets and on non-residents' Spanish assets, with regional variations in rates and allowances. The standard allowance is €700,000 per person plus a €300,000 primary residence deduction, with rates ranging from 0.2% to 3.5% depending on the autonomous community.

Many other countries have abolished wealth taxes (France abolished its Impôt de Solidarité sur la Fortune in 2017) or never imposed them. The United Kingdom, for example, does not impose annual wealth taxes, though it taxes certain capital through inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Where neither treaty partner imposes capital taxes, Article 22 has limited practical significance, but its inclusion in treaties addresses contingencies that may arise if countries subsequently introduce wealth taxes.

#### 4.2. Interaction with Domestic Law

Article 22 operates as a limitation on domestic taxing rights, not as a grant of taxing power. A state may only tax capital under Article 22 if its domestic law independently imposes such taxation. The treaty permits taxation but does not require it.

This interaction creates asymmetric outcomes where treaty partners have different domestic tax systems. A residence state without wealth taxes cannot tax capital that Article 22 assigns to it, while a situs state with wealth taxes may exercise its paragraph 1 or 2 rights. The result may be single taxation by the situs state alone, or no taxation if neither state exercises its rights.

### 5. UN Model Comparison

#### 5.1. Identical Core Provisions

The UN Model Convention Article 22 is identical to the OECD Model in its core structure and allocation rules. Both models contain the same four paragraphs with substantially similar wording. This convergence reflects international consensus that capital taxation allocation does not raise the same developed/developing country tensions as income allocation.

Unlike investment income articles where the UN Model provides greater source-state rights (higher withholding rates, broader definitions), capital taxation involves different dynamics. Developing countries often do not impose annual wealth taxes, reducing their interest in expanded source-state capital taxation rights.

#### 5.2. Policy Implications

The identity between OECD and UN Models simplifies treaty negotiations and interpretation. Negotiators need not navigate competing model provisions, and Commentary from either organisation applies without conflict. This consistency also facilitates multilateral initiatives, as states can adopt uniform Article 22 provisions regardless of their development status.

### 6. Commentary Analysis

#### 6.1. Key Commentary Provisions

The Commentary on Article 22 emphasises the deliberate parallelism with income articles. Commentary paragraph 1 notes that "Articles 6 to 21 determine, with regard to different classes of income, the respective rights to tax of the State of source or situs and of the State of residence, and Article 22 does the same with regard to capital."

The Commentary also addresses the interaction between capital and gains taxation. For immovable property, the same situs state that may tax capital under Article 22(1) may tax gains under Article 13(1), ensuring consistent treatment of the asset's value whether measured statically (wealth tax) or upon realisation (capital gains tax).

#### 6.2. Historical Development

Article 22 has remained relatively stable since the OECD Model's inception. The 1963 Draft Convention established the current four-paragraph structure, and subsequent updates have primarily addressed technical refinements rather than fundamental changes.

Paragraph 2 was amended in 2000 to clarify the permanent establishment connection. Paragraph 3 was amended in 2017 to align with Article 8's updated treatment of international transport. These amendments demonstrate the ongoing effort to maintain coherence across related articles.

### 7. Practical Application

#### 7.1. Determining Capital Situs

Applying Article 22 requires determining where capital is "situated" for immovable property and where it "forms part of business property" for permanent establishment assets. For immovable property, situs is generally straightforward—land is situated where it lies, and buildings where they stand.

For permanent establishment assets, functional connection determines attribution. Assets must serve the permanent establishment's business activities rather than being held passively. Working capital, operational equipment, and trade receivables typically satisfy this test; investment securities held for treasury purposes may not.

#### 7.2. Valuation Issues

Capital taxes require asset valuation, which may differ between treaty partners. A residence state may value worldwide assets using domestic valuation rules, while a situs state values local assets using its own rules. Where these rules diverge, the same asset may be valued differently for purposes of each state's tax.

Treaty provisions do not harmonise valuation rules, leaving this matter to domestic law. Taxpayers may face complexity where material valuation differences exist, though double taxation relief should mitigate the ultimate economic impact.

#### 7.3. Relief Mechanisms

Where both states tax capital—the situs state under paragraphs 1 or 2, and the residence state under general jurisdiction—Article 23 requires relief. The method of relief (credit or exemption) follows the same mechanism used for double-taxed income, providing consistent treatment across the treaty.

For capital exclusively allocated under paragraphs 3 or 4, no relief mechanism is needed because only one state may tax. The exclusive allocation itself prevents double taxation.

### 8. Relationship with Other Articles

#### 8.1. Article 13 Connection

Article 22 complements Article 13 (Capital Gains) in the treaty framework. Article 13 allocates taxing rights when capital is realised through alienation; Article 22 allocates rights over the capital's ongoing existence. The same connecting factors apply: situs for immovable property (Articles 13(1) and 22(1)), permanent establishment for business assets (Articles 13(2) and 22(2)), effective management for transport assets (Articles 13(3) and 22(3)), and residence for other property (Articles 13(5) and 22(4)).

This parallelism ensures that states cannot circumvent allocation rules by choosing between income/gains taxation and capital taxation. A situs state that may tax gains from immovable property alienation may also tax the capital value annually; a residence state with exclusive gains rights over portfolio securities also has exclusive capital rights.

#### 8.2. Article 23 Integration

Article 23's relief mechanisms apply to capital taxation just as they apply to income taxation. Where double taxation occurs because both the situs and residence states exercise permitted taxing rights, the residence state must eliminate double taxation through credit or exemption.

The same structural issues arise—limitation of credit to domestic tax liability, exemption with progression, interaction with domestic capital tax rules—requiring careful integration of treaty and domestic provisions.

### 9. Emerging Issues

#### 9.1. Digital Assets and Cryptocurrency

The growth of digital assets, including cryptocurrency, creates application challenges for Article 22. These assets lack physical situs and may not clearly fall within existing categories. Are cryptocurrencies "movable property" under paragraph 4's residual rule, or do they require specific treatment?

Current Commentary does not address digital assets specifically. In the absence of specific provisions, paragraph 4's residual rule likely applies, granting exclusive residence-state taxation. However, the characterisation of digital assets as property, currency, or something else may affect this analysis under domestic law.

#### 9.2. Wealth Tax Revival

Political discussions in several countries have considered introducing or expanding wealth taxes, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic's fiscal impact. If more countries adopt wealth taxes, Article 22's practical significance will increase substantially.

Treaty negotiators should consider whether existing Article 22 provisions adequately address modern wealth tax designs, which may include features not contemplated when the article was drafted. Targeted provisions for specific asset classes—particularly intangibles and digital assets—may become more common in bilateral negotiations.

### 10. Practical Scenarios

#### 10.1. Cross-Border Real Estate Investment

Consider a Swiss resident who owns rental property in Norway. Under Article 22(1), Norway may tax the capital value of this immovable property under its wealth tax. Switzerland also imposes wealth tax on its residents' worldwide assets but excludes foreign real estate from its tax base. The result is single taxation by Norway—the situs state exercises its permitted rights while the residence state's domestic exclusion prevents double taxation without requiring treaty relief.

#### 10.2. Permanent Establishment with Business Assets

A Spanish enterprise operates a permanent establishment in Switzerland, with manufacturing equipment valued at CHF 5 million. Under Article 22(2), Switzerland may tax this capital as part of the permanent establishment's business property. Spain, as the enterprise's residence state, may also include these assets in its wealth tax base. Where both states tax, Spain must provide relief under Article 23, crediting Swiss wealth tax against Spanish liability on the same assets.

#### 10.3. Portfolio Investment Structure

A Norwegian resident holds shares in a Spanish company worth €10 million. Under Article 22(4), only Norway may tax this capital—Spain has no taxing rights over shares in its companies held by non-residents under this provision. Norway's wealth tax applies to these assets as part of the resident's worldwide wealth, with no treaty limitation or relief mechanism required because exclusive allocation to the residence state prevents double taxation by design.
