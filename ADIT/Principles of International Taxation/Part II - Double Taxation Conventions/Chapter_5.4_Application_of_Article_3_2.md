## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE ROLE OF ARTICLE 3(2)

### 1.1 The Problem Article 3(2) Addresses

Tax treaties cannot define every term they use. When a term is **undefined** in the treaty, how should it be interpreted? Article 3(2) provides the answer—a structured approach that links treaty interpretation to domestic law while preserving the treaty's integrity.

### 1.2 Text of Article 3(2)

**OECD MTC (2017) Article 3(2)**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     ARTICLE 3(2) OECD MTC                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  "As regards the application of the Convention at any time      │
│   by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall,   │
│   unless the context otherwise requires or the competent        │
│   authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the      │
│   provisions of Article 25, have the meaning that it has        │
│   AT THAT TIME under the law of that State for the purposes     │
│   of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning     │
│   under the applicable TAX LAWS of that State prevailing over   │
│   a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State."  │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The UN MDTC contains an **identical provision** in Article 3(2).

### 1.3 Key Features at a Glance

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| "any term not defined therein" | Applies only to undefined terms |
| "unless the context otherwise requires" | Context can override domestic law reference |
| "at that time" | Ambulatory—meaning at time of application |
| "for the purposes of the taxes" | Tax law context |
| "tax laws... prevailing" | Tax law meaning trumps general law meaning |
| "competent authorities agree" | Alternative: CA agreement on meaning |

## 2. STRUCTURE AND ELEMENTS OF ARTICLE 3(2)

### 2.1 The Interpretive Hierarchy Under Article 3(2)

Article 3(2) establishes a clear **hierarchy** for interpreting undefined terms:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        ARTICLE 3(2) INTERPRETIVE HIERARCHY                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 1: Is the term DEFINED in the treaty?                     │
│          (Check Article 3(1) and specific articles)             │
│     ↓                                                           │
│     If YES → Apply treaty definition (Art. 3(2) not needed)     │
│     If NO  → Proceed to Step 2                                  │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 2: Does CONTEXT otherwise require?                        │
│          (Autonomous international meaning)                     │
│     ↓                                                           │
│     If YES → Apply autonomous meaning (not domestic law)        │
│     If NO  → Proceed to Step 3                                  │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 3: Have COMPETENT AUTHORITIES agreed different meaning?   │
│          (Per Article 25 MAP)                                   │
│     ↓                                                           │
│     If YES → Apply CA agreed meaning                            │
│     If NO  → Proceed to Step 4                                  │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 4: Apply DOMESTIC LAW meaning                             │
│          • Tax law meaning prevails over other laws             │
│          • Meaning "at that time" (ambulatory)                  │
│          • Law of the State applying the Convention             │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 "Any Term Not Defined Therein"

Article 3(2) applies only to terms **not defined** in the treaty. Where a term IS defined:
- **Article 3(1)** provides general definitions (e.g., "person", "company", "enterprise")
- **Specific articles** contain context-specific definitions (e.g., Article 10(3) defines "dividends", Article 11(3) defines "interest")

**Examples of defined terms** (not subject to Article 3(2)):
| Article | Defined Terms |
|---------|--------------|
| 3(1)(a) | "person" |
| 3(1)(b) | "company" |
| 3(1)(d) | "enterprise" |
| 4 | "resident" |
| 5 | "permanent establishment" |
| 10(3) | "dividends" |
| 11(3) | "interest" |
| 12(2) | "royalties" |

**Examples of undefined terms** (subject to Article 3(2)):
- "beneficial owner" (though Commentary provides guidance)
- "salaries, wages and other similar remuneration" (Article 15)
- "immovable property" (Article 6 refers to domestic law of situs state)
- Many technical terms used in distributive articles

---

## 3. THE "CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES" EXCEPTION

### 3.1 The Central Safeguard

The phrase "unless the context otherwise requires" is the **critical safeguard** in Article 3(2). It prevents domestic law from overriding the treaty's intended meaning.

**When context may "otherwise require"**:
1. OECD Commentary provides autonomous meaning
2. Domestic law meaning would frustrate treaty purpose
3. Both Contracting States understood a common meaning
4. Comparative treaty practice suggests international meaning
5. Using domestic law would cause double taxation or double non-taxation

### 3.2 What Constitutes "Context"?

Building on VCLT Article 31(2)-(3), "context" includes:

| Source | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Treaty text** | Preamble, other articles, definitions |
| **Related agreements** | Protocols, exchanges of notes |
| **OECD/UN Commentaries** | Guidance on treaty provisions |
| **Subsequent practice** | How parties have applied the term |
| **International consensus** | Generally accepted tax treaty meaning |
| **Object and purpose** | Elimination of double taxation; prevention of abuse |

### 3.3 The Avery Jones View

Professor John Avery Jones argues that context should "otherwise require" when:
- Domestic law amendment **enlarges the taxing jurisdiction** of the State making the amendment
- This would **unilaterally change** the treaty balance
- Good faith interpretation would not permit such expansion

As noted in the June 2023 exam solution: *"It is possible that an interpretation of a DTA term that is based on a domestic law meaning may go beyond the context of the DTA and as such the meaning would need to be considered in light of the relevant DTA's purposes."*

### 3.4 Examples: When Context Does/Does Not Require

**Context DOES require autonomous meaning**:
- "Beneficial owner"—OECD Commentary provides autonomous international meaning
- "Enterprise"—defined in Article 3(1)(d) but interpretation linked to treaty context
- Terms where domestic law meaning would produce absurd results

**Context does NOT require (domestic law applies)**:
- Terms with clear domestic tax law meaning that aligns with treaty purpose
- Technical terms with no international equivalent
- Where both parties understood domestic law would apply

---

## 4. THE "AT THAT TIME" REQUIREMENT: AMBULATORY INTERPRETATION

### 4.1 The 1995 Amendment

The phrase "at that time" was added to Article 3(2) in **1995** to clarify the interpretive approach:

**Pre-1995 text**: *"...have the meaning which it has under the law of that State concerning the taxes..."*

**Post-1995 text**: *"...have the meaning that it has AT THAT TIME under the law of that State..."*

### 4.2 Ambulatory vs Static for Domestic Law Reference

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           AMBULATORY INTERPRETATION UNDER ART. 3(2)             │

│                                                                 │
│  "At that time" = meaning at time of APPLICATION                │
│                   (not time of treaty conclusion)               │
│                                                                 │
│  EXAMPLE:                                                       │
│  • Treaty signed in 2000                                        │
│  • Domestic law term "X" defined as meaning "A" in 2000         │
│  • Domestic law amended in 2015: "X" now means "B"              │
│  • Treaty applied in 2024                                       │
│                                                                 │
│  Under ambulatory approach: "X" means "B" (2024 meaning)        │
│  Under static approach: "X" would mean "A" (2000 meaning)       │
│                                                                 │
│  OECD Commentary [11]: The phrase "at that time" confirms       │
│  that the meaning is determined based on law "in force when     │
│  the Convention is being applied, i.e. when the tax is imposed" │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.3 Advantages and Concerns

**Advantages of ambulatory approach**:
1. Treaty keeps pace with evolving domestic law
2. Taxing provisions and treaty relief have same scope (Avery Jones)
3. Practical—no need to research historical law meanings
4. Prevents treaty from becoming outdated

**Concerns**:
1. State could unilaterally change treaty effect by amending domestic law
2. "Context otherwise requires" safeguard must prevent abuse
3. May create uncertainty for taxpayers

As the June 2023 exam noted: *"The actual wording of Article 3(2) is an ambulatory interpretation of the domestic law, which requires the meaning of the term to be determined at the time of application of the DTA as opposed to applying the meaning at the time the DTA was signed."*

### 4.4 Pre-1995 Treaties

For treaties based on the **pre-1995** version of Article 3(2) (without "at that time"):
- Position is less clear
- Some courts applied static approach (*R v Melford Development Inc*, Canada)
- Current consensus generally favours ambulatory even for older treaties

---

## 5. "TAX LAWS... PREVAILING OVER OTHER LAWS"

### 5.1 The 1995 Clarification

The 1995 amendment also added the clarification that **tax law meanings prevail** over meanings under other laws:

*"...any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State."*

### 5.2 Rationale

Why tax law meanings prevail:
- Treaties deal with taxes—tax law meanings most relevant
- Ensures consistency between domestic taxing provisions and treaty relief
- Tax law definitions typically more precise than general law definitions
- OECD Commentary [13.1] confirms this hierarchy

### 5.3 Practical Application

| Scenario | Which Law Applies |
|----------|------------------|
| Term defined in tax legislation | Tax law definition |
| Term defined in tax law AND general law | Tax law definition prevails |
| Term defined only in general law | General law definition (but subject to context test) |
| Term not defined in any domestic law | May need to refer to ordinary meaning/context |

---

## 6. COMPETENT AUTHORITY AGREEMENT

### 6.1 The Alternative Route

Article 3(2) provides that competent authorities may agree a **different meaning** under Article 25 (MAP):

*"...unless... the competent authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 25..."*

This allows:
- Resolution of interpretation disputes
- Consistent interpretation between both States
- Avoidance of double taxation from divergent interpretations

### 6.2 Status of CA Agreements

CA agreements on meaning:
- Binding on the tax authorities of both States
- May or may not bind courts (depends on jurisdiction)
- Can be reached proactively or in response to specific case
- Published agreements provide guidance to taxpayers

---

## 7. RELATIONSHIP WITH VCLT AND CHAPTER 5.1-5.3

### 7.1 Article 3(2) as "Special Rule"

Article 3(2) has been described as a **special rule** relative to the VCLT general rules (Dourado et al, 2022):

| Rule | Scope |
|------|-------|
| VCLT Articles 31-32 | General rules for all treaty interpretation |
| Article 3(2) OECD MTC | Special rule for undefined terms in DTCs |

However, Article 3(2) operates **within** the VCLT framework—it does not replace VCLT principles.

### 7.2 Integration with VCLT

The proper approach integrates both:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           INTEGRATED VCLT / ARTICLE 3(2) APPROACH               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  1. Apply VCLT Article 31 (good faith, ordinary meaning,        │
│     context, object and purpose) to the treaty as a whole       │
│                                                                 │
│  2. For UNDEFINED terms specifically:                           │
│     • Article 3(2) is PART OF the treaty context                │
│     • Its "context otherwise requires" language invokes         │
│       VCLT contextual interpretation                            │
│     • If context does NOT require autonomous meaning,           │
│       domestic law reference applies (ambulatory)               │
│                                                                 │
│  3. OECD Commentary helps determine whether "context            │
│     otherwise requires"                                         │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 7.3 Article 3(2) and Treaty Override

The June 2023 exam explored whether Article 3(2) permits "treaty override":

**View 1**: Article 3(2) "bakes in" the possibility of domestic law changes affecting treaty meaning—this is anticipated, not override (Elliffe, 2022).

**View 2**: Changes that go beyond treaty context or frustrate treaty purposes constitute impermissible override, despite Article 3(2).

**Safeguard**: The "context otherwise requires" exception prevents abusive domestic law changes from overriding treaty intent.

## 8. PRACTICAL APPLICATION

### 8.1 Step-by-Step Approach for Exam Questions

When asked to interpret an undefined term:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       APPLYING ARTICLE 3(2) IN EXAM SCENARIOS                   │

│  1. CONFIRM term is undefined in treaty                         │
│     • Check Article 3(1) and specific article definitions       │
│     • State: "The term [X] is not defined in the Convention"    │
│                                                                 │
│  2. CONSIDER whether context otherwise requires                 │
│     • Is there OECD/UN Commentary guidance?                     │
│     • Is there an autonomous international meaning?             │
│     • Would domestic law meaning frustrate treaty purpose?      │
│                                                                 │
│  3. If context does NOT require autonomous meaning:             │
│     • Apply domestic law of State applying treaty               │
│     • Tax law meaning prevails over other laws                  │
│     • Use meaning "at that time" (current meaning)              │
│                                                                 │
│  4. NOTE potential for CA agreement                             │
│     • Competent authorities may agree different meaning         │
│                                                                 │
│  5. ADDRESS implications                                        │
│     • Different meanings may apply in each State                │
│     • May cause double taxation or non-taxation                 │
│                                                                 │

### 8.2 Common Exam Scenarios

| Scenario | Article 3(2) Application |
|----------|-------------------------|
| "What does [undefined term] mean?" | Full Article 3(2) analysis |
| "Can State X apply its new domestic definition?" | "Context otherwise requires" analysis |
| "The term is defined differently in each State" | Each State applies its own law; may cause issues |
| "Is this treaty override?" | Consider whether context permits domestic change |

## 9. COMMENTARY GUIDANCE

### 9.1 Key Commentary Paragraphs

The OECD Commentary on Article 3(2) provides important guidance:

| Paragraph | Topic |
|-----------|-------|
| [11] | "At that time"—ambulatory interpretation |
| [12] | Context considerations |
| [12.1] | Role of object and purpose |
| [13] | Reference to domestic law |
| [13.1] | Tax law prevailing over other laws |

### 9.2 Commentary [12]: Context Analysis

Commentary [12] explains when context may "otherwise require":
- Where application of domestic law would be contrary to treaty purpose
- Where domestic law meaning conflicts with OECD Commentary
- Where both States understood a common international meaning

## 10. KEY CASES

| Case | Jurisdiction | Key Point |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **R v Melford Development Inc** [1982] | Canada (SCC) | Pre-1995 static approach applied |
| **Lamesa Holdings BV** [1997] | Australia | Domestic law meaning vs treaty purpose |
| **Fowler v HMRC** [2020] | UK (SC) | Considered Article 3(2) application |
| **Alta Energy** [2021] | Canada (SCC) | Treaty text primary; domestic law reference |
