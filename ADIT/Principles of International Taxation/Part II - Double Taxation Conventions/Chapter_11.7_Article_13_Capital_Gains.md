# Chapter 11.7: Capital Gains – Article 13, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Policy Framework

### 1.1. The Role of Article 13

Article 13 of the OECD Model Tax Convention addresses the taxation of capital gains—profits derived from the alienation of assets rather than from their ongoing use or exploitation. Unlike Articles 10-12 which govern passive income streams, Article 13 establishes rules for allocating taxing rights over the increase in value of assets realised upon their disposal. The article employs a hierarchical structure that assigns different allocation rules depending on the nature of the asset being alienated, reflecting the varying degrees of connection between different asset types and particular jurisdictions.

The fundamental policy question underlying Article 13 is whether capital gains should be taxed in the state where the asset is located (source state), in the state where the asset owner resides (residence state), or in both states with mechanisms to relieve double taxation. Article 13 answers this question differently depending on asset type, creating a nuanced framework that balances source state claims based on territorial connection against residence state claims based on the owner's tax residence (covered in December 2024).

### 1.2. Policy Rationale for Capital Gains Allocation

The policy rationale for Article 13's structure reflects the principle that taxing rights should correlate with economic connection. Immovable property has an intrinsic and permanent connection to its location, justifying source state taxation under Article 13(1). Business assets of a permanent establishment derive their value from activities conducted in the source state, supporting source taxation under Article 13(2). Ships and aircraft operating in international traffic present practical difficulties for source taxation given their mobility, leading to exclusive residence state taxation under Article 13(3).

The most complex provision, Article 13(4), addresses shares deriving value from immovable property. Without this anti-avoidance provision, taxpayers could avoid source taxation of immovable property gains by interposing holding companies and selling shares rather than property directly. The provision looks through corporate structures to ensure that gains economically attributable to immovable property remain taxable in the source state.

### 1.3. Relationship with Other Treaty Articles

Article 13 must be distinguished from related provisions. Article 6 governs income from immovable property—rental income, agricultural income, and similar returns from ongoing use. Article 13(1) governs gains from disposing of that property. The distinction is temporal: Article 6 applies during ownership while Article 13 applies upon alienation.

Article 7 on business profits may overlap with Article 13(2) regarding PE assets. Where an enterprise sells business assets forming part of PE property, Article 13(2) applies rather than Article 7. However, if the PE itself generates trading profits from regular asset sales (such as a dealer), Article 7 may govern as the gains constitute business income rather than capital gains.

## 2. Article 13 Hierarchical Structure

### 2.1. The Five-Paragraph OECD Framework

Article 13 operates through a hierarchical five-paragraph structure where each paragraph addresses a specific category of property. The paragraphs must be applied sequentially—if a gain falls within an earlier paragraph, later paragraphs do not apply. This hierarchy is: (1) immovable property, (2) movable business property of a PE, (3) ships and aircraft in international traffic, (4) shares deriving value from immovable property, and (5) any other property.

The first four paragraphs address specific categories where source state taxation is either permitted or explicitly excluded. Paragraph 5 provides the residual rule for gains not covered by earlier paragraphs, granting exclusive taxing rights to the residence state. This structure ensures comprehensive coverage while preventing overlap between provisions.

### 2.2. Sequential Application

The sequential nature of Article 13 creates important characterisation questions. A gain from selling shares in a company owning immovable property must first be tested against Article 13(4) before falling to Article 13(5). If the shares derive more than fifty percent of their value from immovable property during the relevant period, Article 13(4) applies. Otherwise, Article 13(5)'s residence-only taxation applies.

This hierarchical structure differs from passive income articles where the category is usually clear. For Article 13, proper characterisation of the asset and careful application of each paragraph in sequence is essential for determining the correct tax allocation.

## 3. Article 13(1): Immovable Property Gains

### 3.1. Scope and Source State Rights

Article 13(1) provides that gains from alienation of immovable property may be taxed in the Contracting State where the property is situated. This grants the source state (situs state) concurrent taxing rights alongside the residence state, with the residence state obligated to provide double taxation relief under Article 23.

The provision uses permissive language ("may be taxed") that does not preclude residence state taxation but establishes that the source state has priority. The economic rationale is straightforward: immovable property cannot be relocated to avoid taxation, has permanent connection to the situs state, and often benefits from local infrastructure and legal protections that justify local taxation.

### 3.2. Definition and Cross-Reference to Article 6

Article 13(1) references Article 6(2) for the definition of immovable property. This incorporates the domestic law definition of the situs state, supplemented by specific treaty inclusions: property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agricultural and forestry, rights governed by landed property law, usufruct of immovable property, and rights to variable or fixed payments for working mineral deposits or natural resources.

Ships, boats, and aircraft are explicitly excluded from immovable property, regardless of how domestic law might characterise them. This exclusion ensures these mobile assets fall under Article 13(3) rather than being subject to situs-based taxation (covered in December 2023).

## 4. Article 13(2): Business Assets of a Permanent Establishment

### 4.1. PE Business Property

Article 13(2) provides that gains from alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment may be taxed in the state where the PE is situated. This extends source state taxing rights beyond immovable property to business assets connected to PE activities—inventory, equipment, goodwill, and similar assets.

The connection requirement is that assets must form "part of the business property" of the PE. This requires attribution of assets to the PE based on their use in PE activities. Assets held for investment purposes rather than business operations may not qualify, potentially falling under Article 13(5) instead.

### 4.2. Alienation of PE Assets

Article 13(2) applies both to piecemeal asset sales and to complete PE liquidations. When an enterprise sells its entire PE including all associated assets, Article 13(2) governs the gains on those assets. The provision also applies when the PE itself is alienated as a going concern.

The interaction with transfer pricing rules under Article 9 becomes relevant when assets are transferred between associated enterprises. Such transfers may constitute alienation triggering Article 13(2), with the gain measured at arm's length value regardless of the actual transfer price.

## 5. Article 13(3): Ships and Aircraft

### 5.1. Exclusive Residence State Taxation

Article 13(3) provides that gains from alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to their operation, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State where the enterprise's place of effective management is situated.

The word "only" creates exclusive residence state taxation—source states have no taxing rights over such gains. This reflects practical difficulties with source-based taxation of mobile assets that operate across multiple jurisdictions. Attempting to apportion gains among all states where ships or aircraft operate would create unworkable complexity.

The provision covers not only the vessels themselves but also pertaining movable property—spare parts, cargo handling equipment, and similar assets used in operations. This ensures comprehensive residence state taxation of the shipping or aviation enterprise's capital gains.

## 6. Article 13(4): Shares in Property-Rich Companies

### 6.1. The 50% Threshold Test

Article 13(4) addresses gains from alienation of shares or comparable interests deriving more than fifty percent of their value from immovable property situated in a Contracting State. Where this threshold is met, the source state may tax the gains as if the alienator had disposed of the underlying immovable property directly.

The fifty percent threshold is a bright-line test—at or above fifty percent, Article 13(4) applies; below fifty percent, the shares fall under Article 13(5) with exclusive residence taxation. The test examines the value derived from immovable property, not merely the asset composition by book value. Fair market value measurement typically applies.

### 6.2. The 365-Day Lookback Period

The 2017 OECD Model introduced a critical anti-avoidance element: the fifty percent test applies if the threshold is exceeded "at any time during the 365 days preceding the alienation." This prevents taxpayers from temporarily diluting the immovable property percentage through asset injections immediately before disposal.

For example, if shares derive sixty percent of their value from immovable property throughout the year but the shareholder injects cash to reduce this to forty-five percent one week before sale, Article 13(4) still applies because the threshold was exceeded during the preceding 365 days. The test is not point-in-time at disposal but rather a lookback over the entire period (covered in June 2024).

### 6.3. Direct and Indirect Value

Article 13(4) applies where shares derive value from immovable property "directly or indirectly." This look-through provision prevents avoidance through multi-tier holding structures. If Company A owns Company B which owns immovable property, shares in Company A may be tested by looking through to the underlying property value.

The indirect value calculation requires tracing through corporate chains to identify ultimate immovable property exposure. Complex group structures may require detailed analysis of each entity's assets to determine whether the fifty percent threshold applies at the level of the shares being alienated.

### 6.4. Anti-Avoidance Function

Article 13(4) functions as an anti-avoidance provision preventing the conversion of immovable property gains into share disposal gains that would otherwise escape source taxation. Without this provision, taxpayers could contribute property to a holding company, wait, and sell shares rather than property—transforming a source-taxable gain into a residence-taxable gain under Article 13(5).

The provision is particularly important for real estate holding structures commonly used for commercial property, development land, and residential portfolios. Tax authorities have successfully applied this provision to deny residence-only treatment where the shareholding's value derives substantially from immovable property.

## 7. Article 13(5): Other Gains

### 7.1. Residual Exclusive Residence Taxation

Article 13(5) provides that gains from alienation of any property other than that covered by paragraphs 1-4 shall be taxable only in the residence state of the alienator. This residual rule grants exclusive residence state taxation for gains lacking sufficient source state nexus.

Categories falling under Article 13(5) include: shares in operating companies not meeting the property-rich threshold, portfolio investments, intangible assets, goodwill not associated with a PE, and other financial assets. The exclusive residence taxation reflects the view that such gains lack the territorial connection justifying source taxation.

Recent Indian tribunal decisions have confirmed that Article 13(5) applies strictly—even where the residence state does not tax the gain, the source state cannot assert concurrent jurisdiction. Non-taxation in the residence state does not resurrect source state taxing rights that the treaty has extinguished.

## 8. UN Model Differences

### 8.1. UN Article 13(5): Source State Share Rights

The UN Model diverges significantly from the OECD Model by inserting an additional paragraph 5 that grants source state taxing rights over gains from share disposals. Under UN Article 13(5), gains from alienation of shares in a company resident in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that state if the alienator held, at any time during the twelve months preceding alienation, directly or indirectly at least a specified percentage of the capital.

The threshold percentage is left blank for bilateral negotiation, typically ranging from five to twenty percent depending on the negotiating positions. This provision reflects the UN Model's orientation toward protecting developing country tax bases by retaining source taxation over significant shareholdings in domestic companies.

### 8.2. UN Article 13(6): Residual Rule

The UN Model's residual rule appears in Article 13(6) rather than 13(5), providing that gains from any property not covered by preceding paragraphs are taxable only in the residence state. The substance is identical to OECD Article 13(5), but the numbering differs due to insertion of the share disposal provision.

### 8.3. Threshold Variations in Practice

Treaty practice shows significant variation in UN Article 13(5) thresholds. Australia typically negotiates ten percent, the United States uses five percent in some treaties, and developing countries often seek fifteen to twenty percent. These variations reflect bargaining positions and policy preferences regarding the balance between source and residence taxation of investment gains.

## 9. Recent Developments

### 9.1. MLI Impact on Article 13

The Multilateral Instrument (MLI) affects Article 13 through multiple provisions. MLI Article 9 modifies covered tax agreements to include property-rich company provisions with the 365-day lookback period. This updates older treaties lacking modern anti-avoidance language.

MLI Article 7 introduces the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) which applies to all treaty benefits including Article 13. If obtaining a capital gains exemption was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement, the benefit may be denied. This creates additional scrutiny for property-rich company structures and conduit arrangements designed to access favourable treaty treatment.

The January 2025 India Supreme Court stay in the Tiger Global case highlights ongoing tensions between treaty protections and anti-avoidance principles. The court is reviewing whether grandfathered transactions under India-Mauritius treaty amendments remain protected despite PPT introduction.

### 9.2. State Practice Developments

Several jurisdictions have expanded domestic capital gains taxation in ways that interact with Article 13 provisions. The UK extended Non-Resident Capital Gains Tax in April 2019 to shares in property-rich companies, applying a seventy-five percent threshold rather than the OECD's fifty percent. Rates increased substantially to twenty-four percent in October 2024, making the UK one of the higher-taxing jurisdictions for non-resident property gains. Filing obligations apply even where a treaty exempts the gain, requiring careful compliance planning.

Australia increased foreign resident capital gains withholding from 12.5% to fifteen percent effective January 2025, simultaneously removing the previous AUD 750,000 threshold and applying withholding to all property disposals regardless of value. This expansion significantly increases compliance burdens for cross-border property transactions. Germany's exit tax applies to departing residents with unrealized gains on company shareholdings, with indefinite interest-free deferral available for EU/EEA relocations following the Wächtler decision which found immediate taxation without deferral violated freedom of establishment.

### 9.3. Case Law Trends

Recent case law demonstrates strict application of Article 13's hierarchical structure. Indian tribunals in the Saket Kanoi and Anushka Shah cases confirmed that Article 13(5) applies strictly to mutual fund units—taxable only in the residence state even where that state imposes no tax. This prevents source states from asserting jurisdiction that the treaty has allocated exclusively to residence states.

The Blackstone FP Capital Partners ruling clarified that beneficial ownership requirements do not apply to Article 13(4) unless the treaty explicitly requires them. This facilitates fund structures accessing treaty benefits without additional substance requirements beyond those in the treaty text.

## 10. Practical Application

### 10.1. Characterisation Issues

Proper characterisation is essential for Article 13 application. The distinction between immovable and movable property, the classification of business assets as PE property, and the calculation of the property-rich threshold all require careful analysis. Practitioners must systematically work through the Article 13 hierarchy, testing each paragraph in sequence before concluding which provision governs.

The Indian Supreme Court's Bharti Airtel decision addressed whether telecommunications towers constitute immovable property. The court held that immovability depends on the degree of annexation and purpose—equipment attached to buildings is not automatically immovable. This affects Article 13(4) calculations for infrastructure companies where tower assets may or may not count toward the fifty percent threshold.

Mixed-use assets and hybrid instruments present additional characterisation challenges. Convertible bonds may be treated as shares for some purposes and debt for others. Leasehold interests of varying duration may be characterised as immovable property in some jurisdictions and movable in others. Mineral rights and extraction licences require careful analysis of whether they constitute interests in immovable property under Article 6(2) or separate intangible assets.

### 10.2. Timing and Valuation

Timing issues arise in applying the 365-day lookback period. The test examines whether the threshold was exceeded at any point during the period, not merely at disposal. Valuation must be determined at each relevant date, which may require multiple valuations for volatile assets or fluctuating portfolios.

Exit taxation presents additional timing considerations. Some jurisdictions impose deemed disposal upon emigration, triggering capital gains tax on unrealized appreciation. Treaty interaction with such provisions depends on specific treaty language and the scope of saving clauses preserving domestic taxing rights over former residents.
