### Article 7: Business Profits

#### 1. Introduction

##### 1.1. The Role of Article 7 in Treaty Architecture

Article 7 allocates taxing rights over business profits between the residence state and the source state. It establishes that business profits are taxable only in the residence state unless the enterprise carries on business in the source state through a permanent establishment (PE). This creates a direct connection between Article 5 (determining whether a PE exists) and Article 7 (determining taxable profit attribution).

The allocation operates on a binary basis: without a PE, the residence state has exclusive taxing rights; with a PE, the source state may tax profits attributable to that establishment.

##### 1.2. The Permanent Establishment Threshold

Article 5 first determines whether a PE exists through fixed place of business tests, building site duration thresholds, or dependent agent criteria. If no PE exists, Article 7(1) applies: profits are taxable only in the residence state. If a PE exists, Article 7(1) second sentence applies: profits attributable to the PE may be taxed in the source state.

This threshold mechanism ensures source states cannot tax foreign business income without substantial economic presence. The PE requirement serves as a jurisdictional gateway, limiting source taxation to situations where an enterprise has more than transitory connection to the source jurisdiction.

##### 1.3. Article 7 as a Residual Provision

Article 7 functions as a residual provision for business income. It applies to business profits not covered by specific distributive articles: Article 6 (immovable property), Article 8 (shipping and air transport), Articles 10-12 (dividends, interest, royalties), and Article 13 (capital gains). Specific articles take precedence over Article 7, ensuring specialized rules govern particular income types while Article 7 captures remaining active business income.

#### 2. Text and Structure of Article 7

##### 2.1. Treaty Text (OECD Model 2017)

**Article 7(1):**
> "Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State."

**Article 7(2):**
> "For the purposes of this Article and Article [23 A] [23 B], the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise."

**Article 7(3):**
> "Where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, the other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged on those profits. In determining such adjustment, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other."

**Article 7(4):**
> "No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise."

##### 2.2. Overview of Article 7 Provisions

Article 7(1) establishes the basic allocation rule between residence-only taxation (no PE) and shared jurisdiction (PE exists). Article 7(2) provides the attribution methodology using separate entity and arm's length principles based on functions, assets, and risks. Article 7(3) addresses corresponding adjustments to eliminate double taxation. Article 7(4) prevents profit attribution for mere purchasing activities.

#### 3. The Basic Allocation Rule

##### 3.1. Exclusive Residence Taxation Without PE

Article 7(1) first sentence grants exclusive taxing rights to the residence state when no PE exists: "Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable **only in that State**..." The term "only" prevents source taxation entirely, reflecting treaty policy that business profits require substantial presence for source taxation.

The source state must refrain from taxing business profits even if the enterprise conducts transactions within its territory. If a resident enterprise of State R makes direct sales to State S customers without a PE, State S cannot tax those profits despite source connection.

##### 3.2. Source State Taxation With PE

When a PE exists, Article 7(1) second sentence grants source state taxing rights: "...the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment... **may be taxed** in that other State." This creates shared taxing rights, with double taxation relief under Article 23.

The source state's right extends only to profits "attributable to" the PE. This prevents taxing the enterprise's worldwide profits merely because a PE exists. Functional analysis is required to determine profit allocation to the PE.

##### 3.3. Definitional Elements

**Enterprise of a Contracting State:** Article 3(1)(c) defines this as "any business carried on by a resident of a Contracting State," encompassing corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships that qualify as residents under Article 4.

**Carries on business:** Active engagement in commercial activities, broader than passive investments. Encompasses trading, manufacturing, service provision, and other active operations. The distinction matters because passive income typically falls under Articles 10-12.

**Profits:** Broadly interpreted to include all business income from commercial activities. Not treaty-defined, so domestic law applies under Article 3(2). Includes trading income, business receipts, and gains from business asset disposal, but excludes capital gains from non-business assets (Article 13).

#### 4. Profit Attribution Under the Authorised OECD Approach

##### 4.1. The Functionally Separate Entity Approach

Article 7(2) requires attributing profits to the PE as if it were "a **separate and independent enterprise** engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions." This functionally separate entity approach treats the PE as hypothetically independent, even though legally it and the head office constitute one entity.

Profits are attributed based on what the PE would earn operating independently at arm's length with the head office. This differs from formulary apportionment, which mechanically divides profits by factors like assets or sales. Instead, it demands functional analysis of the PE's activities, assets, and risks.

##### 4.2. The Two-Step AOA Methodology

The **Authorised OECD Approach (AOA)**, developed in the 2010 OECD Report and incorporated into Article 7(2) in 2010, establishes a two-step process:

**Step 1: Functional and Factual Analysis.** Hypothesise the PE as separate and identify functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed. Central is "significant people functions" (SPFs)—economically significant activities and decision-making by personnel. Assets and risks are attributed based on which part exercises control through SPF analysis.

**Step 2: Determine Arm's Length Profits.** Apply transfer pricing principles to price "dealings" between PE and head office at arm's length. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines apply by analogy, considering comparability factors including functions, assets, risks, contractual terms, and economic circumstances.

The result: profits attributable to the PE equal the arm's length return for attributed functions, assets, and risks.

##### 4.3. Functions, Assets, and Risks Analysis

**Functions performed:** Examines activities the PE carries out—sales, manufacturing, R&D, management, or support services. Focus is on significant people functions—value-creating activities by personnel. If the PE employs sales personnel who negotiate contracts, these sales functions are attributed to the PE.

**Assets used:** Determines economically owned assets—tangible (buildings, equipment), intangible (IP, customer relationships), and financial assets. Attribution is based on which part performs SPFs that create, acquire, maintain, or control assets.

**Risks assumed:** Business risks (market, credit, operational, financial) are allocated based on control. Risks are attributed where personnel perform SPFs that assume and manage them. The Hyatt International case (India Supreme Court, 2025) illustrated that a PE can be attributed positive income based on functions and risks even when the enterprise reports global losses.

**Dealings:** Internal transactions between PE and head office must be recognised and priced at arm's length. These notional transactions have no legal effect but are priced for tax purposes—including services, intangible asset use, and goods transfers.

##### 4.4. The OECD 2010 Attribution Report

The OECD's 2010 Report provides comprehensive AOA guidance in four parts: general principles (Part I), banks (Part II), global trading (Part III), and insurance (Part IV). The Report confirms that OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines apply **by analogy** to PE dealings. The five transfer pricing methods can be adapted, accounting for the fact that a PE and head office are one legal entity.

##### 4.5. Attribution of Free Capital to Permanent Establishments

A crucial aspect is attributing appropriate **free capital** (equity) to the PE. A PE cannot have external debt with its head office legally—internal "loans" are not enforceable. Nevertheless, the PE must be attributed capital to support its functions and risks.

Capital attribution significantly affects taxable profits. More capital means less deductible interest (less debt funding), yielding higher profits. Less capital means more deductible interest and lower profits.

Methodologies include: (1) **capital allocation approach**—attributing proportional enterprise capital based on assets/risks; (2) **thin capitalisation approach**—attributing minimum capital required by comparable enterprises; (3) **safe harbour approach**—using fixed percentages for simplicity.

The connection to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 4 (interest limitation) has gained importance. Action 4 earnings stripping rules limit interest deductions, requiring coordination with Article 7 capital attribution. The 2025 OECD guidance clarified that interest limitation rules apply at entity level and should coordinate with PE profit attribution to avoid double restriction.

##### 4.6. Recent Developments and 2025 Updates

The OECD issued 2025 Commentary updates addressing remote work and digital business models. When employees work remotely from another jurisdiction, the remote location may constitute a PE if thresholds are met. For profit attribution, the location where significant people functions are performed remains determinative—if key decision-makers work remotely from State S, functions and risks should be attributed to a PE in State S.

Updates also address digital PEs under revised Article 5 (BEPS Action 7), clarifying that profit attribution should focus on automated functions and platform value, considering where digital content is created and user engagement occurs. This evolves traditional FAR analysis for minimal physical but substantial economic presence (as covered in June 2023).

#### 5. Corresponding Adjustments to Eliminate Double Taxation

##### 5.1. The Need for Adjustments

Article 7(3) addresses double taxation when one state attributes profits to a PE and taxes them while the residence state has already taxed the same profits as part of worldwide income. Without adjustment, the enterprise faces economic double taxation.

For example: enterprise resident in State R has PE in State S. State S taxes 100 PE profits. State R taxes 500 worldwide income (including the 100). Without Article 7(3), the 100 is taxed twice.

##### 5.2. Operation of the Adjustment Mechanism

Article 7(3) requires the residence state to adjust to eliminate double taxation on PE profits. Adjustment uses Article 23 mechanisms: exemption method (Article 23A) exempts PE profits from tax base; credit method (Article 23B) allows foreign tax credit for source state tax.

This coordination ensures the source state's attribution is respected, preventing greater taxation than without treaty.

##### 5.3. Conditions and Limitations

The adjustment obligation requires the source state's adjustment be "in accordance with paragraph 2"—complying with arm's length principle and AOA. If attribution is excessive or improper, the residence state need not provide full relief.

Where states disagree on attribution, Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) allows competent authorities to consult and agree on proper attribution. If agreed, both states adjust taxation to reflect the allocation.

#### 6. The Purchasing Exception

##### 6.1. Rationale and Scope

Article 7(4) provides: "No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the **mere purchase** by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise." Purchasing activities alone don't generate profits—they're cost centres, not profit centres. A PE solely conducting procurement doesn't perform value-creating functions justifying profit attribution.

##### 6.2. Limitations of the Exception

Article 7(4) applies only to "mere" purchasing in isolation. If the PE combines purchasing with processing, manufacturing, or sales, the exception doesn't apply and profits may be attributed based on full functions.

Additionally, Article 7(4) doesn't prevent attributing actual cost savings from PE purchasing. Measurable cost reductions may be relevant to determining arm's length remuneration under the AOA. The exception merely prevents automatic profit attribution based on purchasing volume.

#### 7. Differences in the UN Model Tax Convention

##### 7.1. The Force of Attraction Rule

The most significant OECD-UN difference is the UN Model's **limited force of attraction rule**, absent from the OECD Model, expanding source state taxing rights beyond profits directly attributable to the PE.

Under the OECD Model, only profits actually attributable to the PE are taxable in the source state. If an enterprise has a PE in State S making sales of 100, plus direct sales of 50 to State S customers not through the PE (e.g., internet sales from head office), the 50 isn't taxable in State S.

UN Model Article 7(1) Alternative B allows source state taxation of not only PE-attributable profits, but also:
- (b) sales in that State of goods or merchandise of **same or similar kind** as those sold through the PE; or
- (c) other business activities in that State of **same or similar kind** as those effected through the PE.

Under force of attraction, the 50 of direct sales would be taxable in State S if goods are same or similar kind as PE sales. The rule "attracts" to source jurisdiction income similar to PE activities, even if not conducted through the PE (illustrated in December 2023).

The UN approach favours source and developing countries by preventing manipulation of sales channels. Once a PE exists, the source state has comprehensive jurisdiction over similar activities, reducing tax avoidance opportunities.

##### 7.2. Expense Deduction, Apportionment, and Consistency Rules

The UN Model includes three additional paragraphs:

**Article 7(3) UN** expressly permits deducting expenses incurred for PE purposes, including reasonable executive and administrative expense allocation. This ensures net income reflects appropriate expense allocation. The OECD Model addresses this through the AOA without separate provision.

**Article 7(4) UN** allows determining profits by apportioning total enterprise profits where direct attribution is impractical. This apportionment method (based on turnover, assets, or payroll) contrasts with OECD's separate entity approach, reflecting UN recognition that developing countries may lack resources for complex functional analyses.

**Article 7(5) UN** requires using the same profit determination method year to year absent good reason. This promotes stability and prevents opportunistic method switching.

##### 7.3. The UN Position on the Authorised OECD Approach

The UN Model does **not** adopt the full AOA. UN Commentary notes concerns about AOA complexity and administrative burden, particularly for developing countries lacking transfer pricing expertise and resources. The UN acknowledges the AOA as best practice but maintains that simpler apportionment may be appropriate where detailed analysis is impractical.

This divergence reflects different priorities. The OECD emphasises precision through arm's length principle despite complexity. The UN balances these goals against practical considerations, particularly developing country administrative capacity, providing flexibility for alternative approaches.

#### 8. Interaction with Other Treaty Provisions

##### 8.1. Article Hierarchy and Precedence

Article 7 operates within a hierarchy where specific articles generally take precedence. Article 6 (immovable property) takes priority for real estate income. Article 8 (shipping/air transport) provides exclusive residence taxation, superseding Article 7. Articles 10-12 (dividends, interest, royalties) govern passive income types, taking priority subject to the effectively connected exception. Article 13 (capital gains) controls gains from property alienation.

Conversely, Article 7 takes priority over Article 21 (other income). If income qualifies as business profits, it doesn't fall into Article 21's residual category. This ensures active business income receives PE threshold protection while miscellaneous income remains subject to potential source taxation.

##### 8.2. Effectively Connected Income Concept

A critical exception arises when dividends, interest, or royalties are "effectively connected" with a PE. Articles 10(4), 11(4), and 12(3) state that if the holding, debt-claim, or right is effectively connected with the PE, income is allocated under Article 7 rather than the specific article.

When effectively connected, the source state isn't limited to reduced withholding rates in Articles 10-12. Income is treated as business profits attributable to the PE, potentially subject to full corporate rates. For example, if a PE holds shares in a local subsidiary, dividends are effectively connected if the shareholding is part of PE business assets. Rather than 5-15% withholding limitation under Article 10, dividends are included in PE profits and taxed at regular corporate rates.

Effective connection determination depends on whether the asset is allocated to the PE under functional analysis—if the PE performs SPFs related to acquiring, holding, and managing the asset, resulting income is effectively connected.

##### 8.3. Distinction Between Article 7 and Article 9

Both Article 7 and Article 9 (associated enterprises) apply arm's length principle to profit allocation, but address different relationships.

**Article 7** allocates profits between a PE and its head office—parts of the same legal entity. The allocation is internal, and "dealings" aren't legally binding but recognised for tax purposes.

**Article 9** allocates profits between separate legal entities (parent-subsidiary, related companies) associated through ownership or control. These are actual contractual transactions between distinct persons.

The interaction has been examined in distinguishing arm's length principle application to separate entities versus permanent establishments (as covered in June 2023). While both apply similar economic analysis based on functions, assets, and risks, the legal relationships differ fundamentally.

Recent Pillar One developments, particularly Amount B addressing baseline marketing and distribution (finalized February 2024), may influence both articles. Amount B provides simplified approaches for routine distribution functions. While designed for Article 9, principles may inform Article 7 profit attribution when PEs perform comparable functions, offering potential safe harbour approaches reducing disputes.
