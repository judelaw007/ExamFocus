━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Syllabus Area: II.H.1 - Business profits (with or without a permanent
               establishment) – Article 7, OECD MTC and UN MDTC
Syllabus Level: 3 (Advanced Knowledge)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Exam Frequency: HIGH - Fundamental provision; often tested with PE questions
Recent Appearances:
  • December 2023: Business profits in PE scenario (Angelica/Felicity)
  • June 2023: Article 7 and Article 9 interaction (ALP vs GFA)
  • December 2022: Source state taxing rights on business profits
  • Multiple years: Article 7 referenced in context of other articles

Strategic Priority: ★★★★★ CRITICAL
- Gateway provision for taxing active business income
- Operates together with Article 5 (PE definition)
- Authorised OECD Approach (AOA) is key examinable concept
- UN Model "force of attraction" is distinguishing feature
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE ROLE OF ARTICLE 7

### 1.1 Purpose and Function

Article 7 allocates taxing rights over **business profits** between the residence state and the source state. It establishes the fundamental principle that:

- **Without a PE**: Business profits are taxable **only** in the residence state
- **With a PE**: The source state may tax profits **attributable to** that PE

This creates a direct connection between Article 5 (PE definition - see Chapter 7.2) and Article 7 (profit allocation). Article 5 determines *whether* the source state can tax; Article 7 determines *how much* it can tax.

### 1.2 The PE Threshold

```
THE ARTICLE 5/ARTICLE 7 RELATIONSHIP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  STEP 1: Does enterprise have a PE in Source State?
          (Apply Article 5 - see Chapter 7.2)

          ↓ NO                           ↓ YES

  STEP 2a: No PE                  STEP 2b: PE exists
           ↓                              ↓
  Article 7(1) first sentence:    Article 7(1) second sentence:
  "Profits...taxable ONLY in      "Profits...may be taxed in
   [Residence] State"              [Source] State"
           ↓                              ↓
  Result: Residence state has     Result: Source state may tax
  EXCLUSIVE taxing rights         profits ATTRIBUTABLE to PE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 1.3 Importance in Treaty Framework

Article 7 is a **residual provision** for business income. It applies to business profits that are not covered by more specific articles:
- Article 6: Income from immovable property
- Article 8: Shipping and air transport
- Articles 10-12: Dividends, interest, royalties
- Article 13: Capital gains

Where income falls under a specific article, that article takes precedence over Article 7.

## 2. ARTICLE 7 TEXT AND STRUCTURE (OECD MTC 2017)

### 2.1 Full Text

**Article 7(1):**
> "Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State."

**Article 7(2):**
> "For the purposes of this Article and Article [23 A] [23 B], the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise."

**Article 7(3):**
> "Where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, the other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged on those profits..."

**Article 7(4):**
> "No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise."

### 2.2 Structure Overview

| Paragraph | Content | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **7(1)** | Basic rule | Residence-only unless PE; source may tax PE profits |
| **7(2)** | Attribution rule | Separate entity/arm's length basis |
| **7(3)** | Corresponding adjustment | Eliminates double taxation |
| **7(4)** | Purchasing exception | No profits from mere purchasing |

---

## 3. ARTICLE 7(1): THE BASIC RULE

### 3.1 Two Limbs of Article 7(1)

**First Sentence (No PE):**
> "Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable **only in that State**..."

This grants **exclusive** taxing rights to the residence state when there is no PE. The word "only" is critical - it prevents source taxation entirely.

**Second Sentence (PE exists):**
> "...the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment... **may be taxed** in that other State."

This grants the source state a **right** (not obligation) to tax. The phrase "may be taxed" indicates shared taxing rights - both states can tax, with double taxation relief under Article 23.

### 3.2 Key Concepts

**"Enterprise of a Contracting State":**
- Defined in Article 3(1)(c): "any business carried on by a resident of a Contracting State"
- Includes companies, partnerships, sole traders
- Must be a resident under Article 4

**"Carries on business":**
- Active engagement in commercial activities
- Broader than merely holding investments
- Distinguished from passive investment income

**"Profits":**
- Broadly interpreted to include all business income
- Not defined in the treaty - reference to domestic law under Article 3(2)
- Includes trading profits, gains from disposal of business assets

---

## 4. ARTICLE 7(2): PROFIT ATTRIBUTION - THE AUTHORISED OECD APPROACH (AOA)

### 4.1 The Separate Entity Fiction

Article 7(2) requires profits to be attributed to the PE as if it were:
> "a **separate and independent enterprise** engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions"

This is the **functionally separate entity approach** - treating the PE as a hypothetically independent enterprise for profit attribution purposes.

### 4.2 The Authorised OECD Approach (AOA)

The AOA was developed in the **2010 OECD Report on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments** and incorporated into Article 7 in the 2010 revision of the OECD MTC.

```
THE AUTHORISED OECD APPROACH (AOA) - TWO STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: FUNCTIONAL AND FACTUAL ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Hypothesise the PE as a separate enterprise
• Identify:
  - Functions performed by the PE
  - Assets used by the PE
  - Risks assumed by the PE
• Identify "significant people functions" (SPFs)
• Attribute assets, risks, and capital accordingly

STEP 2: DETERMINE ARM'S LENGTH PROFITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Price "dealings" between PE and head office at arm's length
• Apply OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines by analogy
• Determine profits PE would earn if independent
• Consider comparability factors

RESULT: Profits attributable to PE = Arm's length return for
        functions, assets, and risks attributed in Step 1

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.3 Key Elements of Article 7(2)

**"Functions performed":**
- What activities does the PE carry out?
- Sales, manufacturing, R&D, management?
- Focus on significant people functions (SPFs)

**"Assets used":**
- What assets are economically owned by the PE?
- Tangible assets, intangibles, financial assets
- Attribution based on SPFs that create, acquire, manage assets

**"Risks assumed":**
- What business risks does the PE bear?
- Market risk, credit risk, operational risk
- Attribution based on SPFs that assume and manage risks

**"Dealings":**
- Internal transactions between PE and head office
- Notional transactions - no legal effect but priced for tax
- Examples: Provision of services, use of assets, transfer of goods

### 4.4 The 2010 Report on Attribution of Profits

The OECD's 2010 Report provides detailed guidance on applying the AOA. Key features:

- **Part I**: General principles
- **Part II**: Banks
- **Part III**: Global trading
- **Part IV**: Insurance

The Report confirms that the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines apply **by analogy** to dealings between a PE and its head office.

### 4.5 Free Capital Attribution

A crucial aspect of the AOA is attributing an appropriate amount of **free capital** to the PE:

```
FREE CAPITAL ATTRIBUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY IT MATTERS:
• A PE cannot have external debt with its head office
• Internal "loans" are not legally enforceable
• PE must be attributed capital to support its functions/risks

METHODS:
1. Capital allocation approach
   - Attribute proportion of enterprise's total capital
   - Based on proportion of assets/risks

2. Thin capitalisation approach
   - Attribute minimum capital required
   - Based on comparable independent enterprises

3. Safe harbour approach
   - Fixed percentage (e.g., regulatory minimum)
   - Simpler but less precise

EFFECT ON PROFITS:
• More capital → Less deductible interest → Higher taxable profits
• Less capital → More deductible interest → Lower taxable profits

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## 5. ARTICLE 7(3): CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENTS

### 5.1 Purpose

Article 7(3) addresses double taxation that can arise when:
- State A attributes profits to a PE and taxes them
- State B (residence state) has already taxed those same profits as part of the enterprise's worldwide income

### 5.2 The Mechanism

```
CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT UNDER ARTICLE 7(3)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO:
Enterprise resident in State R has PE in State S

State S:  "PE earned 100 → We tax 100"
State R:  "Enterprise earned 500 globally (including 100 from PE)"

WITHOUT ADJUSTMENT:
  State S taxes: 100 (PE profits)
  State R taxes: 500 (including the same 100)
  → Double taxation on 100

WITH ARTICLE 7(3):
  State S taxes: 100 (PE profits)
  State R must: Provide relief (exemption or credit per Art 23)
  → Double taxation eliminated

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5.3 Conditions for Adjustment

The obligation to make a corresponding adjustment requires:
- The initial adjustment is in accordance with Article 7(2)
- The other state agrees the adjustment is appropriate
- If states disagree, MAP under Article 25 may be invoked

---

## 6. ARTICLE 7(4): PURCHASING EXCEPTION

### 6.1 The Rule

> "No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the **mere purchase** by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise."

### 6.2 Rationale

Purchasing activities alone do not generate profits - they are cost centres, not profit centres. Even if purchasing activities constitute a PE under Article 5, no profits should be attributed solely for those activities.

### 6.3 Limitations

The exception is narrow:
- Only applies to "mere" purchasing
- If purchasing is combined with other profit-generating activities, profits may be attributed
- Does not prevent attribution of actual purchasing cost savings

---

## 7. UN MODEL DIFFERENCES

### 7.1 Force of Attraction Rule - Article 7(1)

**The most significant difference**: The UN Model includes a **limited force of attraction** rule absent from the OECD Model.

**UN Model Article 7(1) (alternative B):**
> "...such profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to:
> (a) that permanent establishment;
> (b) **sales in that other State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind** as those sold through that permanent establishment; or
> (c) **other business activities carried on in that other State of the same or similar kind** as those effected through that permanent establishment."

```
FORCE OF ATTRACTION - OECD vs UN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OECD MODEL:
  Only profits ACTUALLY ATTRIBUTABLE to PE are taxable in source state

  Enterprise with PE in State S makes:
  - Sales through PE: 100 → Taxable in State S
  - Direct sales to State S customers (not through PE): 50 → NOT taxable in S

UN MODEL (with force of attraction):
  Profits from SIMILAR activities also taxable even if not through PE

  Enterprise with PE in State S makes:
  - Sales through PE: 100 → Taxable in State S
  - Direct sales of SIMILAR goods to State S: 50 → ALSO taxable in S

RATIONALE FOR UN APPROACH:
  • Favours source/developing countries
  • Prevents manipulation of sales channels
  • "Once PE exists, source state has comprehensive jurisdiction"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 7.2 Additional UN Model Provisions

| UN Article | Content | OECD Equivalent |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **7(3)** | Deductible expenses | Not in OECD (covered by AOA) |
| **7(4)** | Apportionment of total profits | Not in OECD |
| **7(5)** | Consistency requirement | Not in OECD |

**Article 7(3) UN - Expense deduction:**
Expressly permits deduction of expenses incurred for PE purposes, including executive and administrative expenses.

**Article 7(4) UN - Apportionment:**
Allows profits to be determined by apportioning total enterprise profits, where attribution is impractical.

**Article 7(5) UN - Consistency:**
Requires the same method of profit determination year to year, unless good reason to change.

### 7.3 UN Rejection of the AOA

The UN Model does **not** adopt the full Authorised OECD Approach. The UN Commentary notes:
- AOA is complex and administratively burdensome
- Developing countries may lack resources to implement
- Simpler apportionment methods may be appropriate

## 8. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER ARTICLES

### 8.1 Priority Rules

```
ARTICLE 7 AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIVE ARTICLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SPECIFIC ARTICLES TAKE PRECEDENCE:

  Article 6 (Immovable Property) → Takes priority over Article 7
  Article 8 (Shipping/Air Transport) → Takes priority over Article 7
  Articles 10-12 (Dividends/Interest/Royalties) → Take priority*
  Article 13 (Capital Gains) → Takes priority over Article 7
  Article 21 (Other Income) → Article 7 takes priority

* UNLESS income is "effectively connected" with a PE (Art 10(4), 11(4), 12(3))

EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED INCOME:
  If dividend/interest/royalty is connected to PE activities:
  → Article 7 applies instead of Articles 10-12
  → No withholding tax limitation applies

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 8.2 Interaction with Article 9

Article 7 and Article 9 (Associated Enterprises) both deal with profit allocation:
- **Article 7**: Allocates profits between a PE and its head office (same legal entity)
- **Article 9**: Allocates profits between separate legal entities (related companies)

**Key connection (June 2023 exam):**
> "Article 9 OECD MTC 2017 works in conjunction with Article 7 in relation to business profits of associated enterprises. Article 9 relies upon the arm's length principle..."

Both articles apply the arm's length principle, but to different relationships.

---

## 9. EXAM APPLICATION

### 9.1 How Article 7 Appears in Exams

Article 7 typically appears:
1. **Integrated with PE analysis** - After determining PE exists, consider profit attribution
2. **In interaction questions** - How Article 7 relates to Articles 9, 10-12, 21
3. **In OECD vs UN comparisons** - Force of attraction differences
4. **In transfer pricing context** - AOA and arm's length dealings

### 9.2 Answer Framework

```
ARTICLE 7 EXAM FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. IDENTIFY THE INCOME TYPE (2 marks)
   "The income in question is business profits / [other]..."
   If not business profits → Other article may apply

2. CHECK FOR PE (3-4 marks)
   "Under Article 5, does the enterprise have a PE?"
   (Cross-reference Chapter 7.2 analysis)

3a. IF NO PE (2-3 marks)
    "Under Article 7(1), profits are taxable ONLY in [Residence State]"
    "The source state has no taxing rights over business profits"

3b. IF PE EXISTS (5-8 marks)
    "Under Article 7(1), profits attributable to the PE may be taxed
     in [Source State]"

    Apply AOA:
    - Functions performed by PE
    - Assets used by PE
    - Risks assumed by PE
    - Arm's length return for those functions/assets/risks

4. CONSIDER UN MODEL DIFFERENCES (if asked) (2-3 marks)
   "Under the UN Model, force of attraction may apply..."

5. CONSIDER INTERACTIONS (2-3 marks)
   "If income is effectively connected to PE, Article 7 applies
    instead of Articles 10-12"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
