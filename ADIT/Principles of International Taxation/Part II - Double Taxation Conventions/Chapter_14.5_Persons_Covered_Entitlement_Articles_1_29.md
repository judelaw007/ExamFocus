# Chapter 14.5: Persons Covered and Entitlement to Benefits – Articles 1 and 29

## 1. Introduction: The Treaty Access Framework

### 1.1. Combined Operation of Articles 1 and 29

Articles 1 and 29 of the OECD Model Tax Convention together constitute the treaty access framework determining who can claim treaty benefits. Article 1 establishes the personal scope—the treaty applies to persons who are residents of one or both Contracting States. Article 29 establishes entitlement to benefits—residents must satisfy anti-abuse tests before actually receiving treaty protection. These provisions operate sequentially and complementarily, creating a comprehensive system for filtering treaty access.

The 2017 OECD Model update fundamentally restructured this framework. Prior to 2017, treaties generally lacked comprehensive anti-abuse provisions, relying primarily on Article 1's residence requirement and the beneficial ownership clauses in Articles 10-12. Treaty shopping—routing investments through favourable treaty jurisdictions—exploited this gap. The introduction of Article 29, implementing BEPS Action 6, closed this gap by adding substantive entitlement requirements beyond mere residence (covered in December 2024).

### 1.2. The Four-Layer Anti-Abuse Framework

Modern tax treaties contain four layers of anti-abuse protection operating cumulatively. The first layer comprises preamble language stating that the treaty's purpose includes eliminating double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. This provides interpretive context for all substantive provisions.

The second layer is Article 1's requirement that persons be residents of a Contracting State. The third layer comprises the beneficial ownership requirements in Articles 10, 11, and 12, which deny reduced withholding rates where recipients are not the beneficial owners of dividends, interest, or royalties. The fourth layer is Article 29's comprehensive entitlement tests—the Limitation on Benefits provisions and Principal Purpose Test.

A person must satisfy all four layers to access treaty benefits. Each layer addresses different aspects of potential abuse, and together they create robust protection against treaty shopping and other forms of treaty exploitation.

## 2. Article 1: Personal Scope

### 2.1. Residents and Transparent Entities

Article 1(1) provides that the convention applies to "persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States." This simple formulation incorporates two concepts defined elsewhere: "persons" in Article 3(1)(a) (individuals, companies, and any other body of persons) and "resident" in Article 4 (liable to tax by reason of domicile, residence, place of management, or similar criteria).

The critical interpretive point is that Article 1 creates only threshold personal scope—it does not independently determine entitlement to benefits. A person satisfying Article 1 has standing to invoke the treaty but must still satisfy Article 29 to actually receive benefits. This distinction, confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Alta Energy Luxembourg (2021), is fundamental to understanding the treaty access framework.

Article 1(2), added in 2017, addresses fiscally transparent entities by providing that income derived through a transparent entity is considered income of a resident only to the extent the residence State treats it as such for taxation. This resolves characterisation conflicts by following the residence State's characterisation. If a partnership's income flows through to partners taxed in their residence State, those partners can claim treaty benefits—the benefits attach to persons actually bearing tax liability.

### 2.2. The Saving Clause

Article 1(3) preserves each Contracting State's right to tax its own residents, providing that the convention does not affect such taxation except for specific provisions that must bind both States to function. The saving clause reflects that DTCs primarily limit source State taxation; residence States retain full sovereignty over their own residents.

The exceptions—Articles 7(3), 9(2), 19, 20, 23A/B, 24, 25, and 28—are provisions that would be rendered meaningless without binding the residence State. Transfer pricing corresponding adjustments require both States to participate. Relief methods require the residence State to provide relief. Non-discrimination requires reciprocal obligations. These exceptions ensure the treaty functions as intended while preserving general residence State sovereignty.

The United States employs a broader saving clause extending to citizens wherever resident and sometimes to former citizens. This reflects US worldwide taxation based on citizenship, meaning treaty benefits in US treaties primarily serve non-US persons deriving US-source income.

## 3. Article 29: Entitlement to Benefits

### 3.1. LOB Structure (Paragraphs 1-7)

Article 29 contains two complementary anti-abuse approaches. Paragraphs 1-7 establish Limitation on Benefits provisions—detailed, rules-based tests determining which residents qualify for benefits. Paragraph 9 establishes the Principal Purpose Test—a flexible, standards-based provision denying benefits where obtaining them was a principal purpose of arrangements.

Paragraph 2 defines "qualified persons" automatically entitled to treaty benefits. Individuals resident in a Contracting State qualify because they cannot engage in corporate structuring typical of treaty shopping. Governments, political subdivisions, and wholly-owned governmental entities qualify for similar reasons. Publicly traded companies with shares regularly traded on recognised stock exchanges qualify because dispersed ownership eliminates treaty shopping concerns. Pension funds and non-profit organisations qualify given their social purposes and regulated nature.

Other entities must satisfy both ownership and base erosion tests. The ownership test requires that more than fifty percent of the entity's voting power and value be held by qualified persons. The base erosion test requires that less than fifty percent of gross income be paid as deductible expenses to non-residents of either Contracting State. These tests ensure entities claiming benefits have genuine connections to the residence State and do not function primarily as conduits.

Paragraph 3 provides the active business test as an alternative qualification. Entities engaged in substantial business activities in their residence State can access benefits on income derived in connection with that business, provided the source-State activity is substantial in relation to the residence-State business. This proportionality requirement prevents token operations from justifying major source-State benefits.

Paragraph 4 addresses derivative benefits, recognising that treaty shopping concerns diminish when ultimate owners would themselves be entitled to equivalent benefits. Where seventy-five percent or more of shares are held by equivalent beneficiaries, the entity can access benefits—structural efficiency rather than treaty shopping motivates such arrangements.

Paragraph 6 provides discretionary competent authority relief as a safety valve. Competent authorities may grant benefits to persons failing objective tests who demonstrate genuine connections to the residence State. This preserves authority to deny benefits in abusive situations while ensuring legitimate arrangements are not denied benefits due to technical failures (covered in December 2023).

### 3.2. PPT (Paragraph 9)

Paragraph 9 establishes the Principal Purpose Test, providing that benefits shall not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining the benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction, unless granting the benefit would accord with the treaty's object and purpose.

The "reasonable to conclude" standard creates an objective test based on what a reasonable observer would conclude from available evidence. It is neither a purely subjective inquiry into taxpayer intent nor a mechanical test applied without regard to context. Tax authorities must examine relevant factors including timing, commercial rationale, entity substance, and available alternative structures.

The "one of the principal purposes" threshold is deliberately lower than "main purpose" or "sole purpose." A purpose is principal if it was a significant consideration that would have justified entering the arrangement. This ensures anti-abuse protection applies broadly to arrangements where tax considerations significantly influenced structure, even if other purposes also existed.

The object and purpose exception provides crucial taxpayer protection. Even where principal purpose is established, benefits must still be granted if granting them accords with the relevant provisions' object and purpose. This protects legitimate arrangements from mechanical denial. A holding company established partly for tax efficiency but genuinely managing investments may access reduced withholding rates if such reduction accords with the dividend article's purpose of facilitating cross-border investment (covered in June 2023).

## 4. Combined Operation

### 4.1. Sequential Application

When applying Articles 1 and 29 to concrete scenarios, analysis proceeds through a logical sequence. The first question asks whether the person is within Article 1's personal scope—a resident of one or both Contracting States. If not, the treaty does not apply, and no further analysis is required.

The second question, addressed by Article 4, determines in which State the person is resident. For dual-resident entities, Article 4(3) provides for competent authority determination considering place of effective management, place of incorporation, and other relevant factors. Failure to resolve dual residence results in denial of treaty benefits except as agreed between competent authorities.

The third question applies Article 29's entitlement tests. Even undisputed residents must satisfy either LOB qualified person tests, the active business alternative, derivative benefits provisions, or competent authority discretionary relief. If applying PPT provisions, the analysis examines whether obtaining benefits was a principal purpose and whether granting benefits accords with object and purpose.

Only after passing these preliminary filters do the distributive rules (Articles 6-22) and relief methods (Articles 23A/23B) apply. This sequential structure ensures comprehensive filtering before substantive benefits flow.

### 4.2. Relationship Between LOB and PPT

Where treaties contain both LOB and PPT provisions, their relationship creates interpretive complexity. The Sixth Peer Review Report acknowledges ongoing development on this question. Does LOB satisfaction create a presumption of treaty entitlement, or can PPT independently deny benefits to persons satisfying LOB?

The Commentary suggests that LOB provisions themselves reflect treaty object and purpose, implying that LOB satisfaction should generally establish entitlement. If a person satisfies objective tests designed to identify legitimate treaty beneficiaries, applying PPT to deny benefits would undermine the certainty LOB provisions were designed to provide.

However, sophisticated arrangements satisfying LOB literally while contradicting treaty purposes might remain subject to PPT denial. An entity technically satisfying qualified person tests but serving primarily as a conduit for third-country residents might face PPT denial if the arrangement's principal purpose was treaty shopping. The final answer on this relationship remains unsettled, with courts and competent authorities continuing to develop interpretive approaches.

## 5. Key Case Law

### 5.1. Alta Energy Luxembourg (Canada, 2021)

The Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L. is the leading authority on the relationship between Articles 1 and 29. Alta Energy, a US company, incorporated a Luxembourg holding company to acquire Canadian shares. Upon selling the shares for over CAD 380 million, the Luxembourg entity claimed treaty exemption from Canadian capital gains tax.

The majority held that Articles 1 and 4 contain no implicit substance requirement. Luxembourg law subjected companies to tax based on legal seat or central management, and Alta Luxembourg satisfied these requirements. The Court refused to read substance requirements into residence provisions, reasoning that if treaty parties intended such requirements, they should have included them expressly.

The decision confirms that Article 1 alone is insufficient to prevent treaty shopping. The residence requirement is necessary but not sufficient for treaty entitlement. Anti-abuse protection comes from Article 29 provisions (in post-2017 treaties) or domestic anti-avoidance rules, not from implicit qualifications of residence status (covered in June 2024).

### 5.2. SC Lowy (India, 2023)

The Delhi ITAT decision in SC Lowy P.I. (LUX) S.A.R.L. v. ACIT addressed PPT burden allocation. A Luxembourg company owned by Cayman-based entities invested in Indian assets. Indian authorities denied treaty benefits under PPT, arguing the structure's purpose was accessing treaty benefits.

The Tribunal ruled for the taxpayer, establishing that tax authorities bear the burden of demonstrating PPT applies. Authorities cannot presume abuse from structural arrangements alone but must provide cogent evidence that obtaining benefits was a principal purpose. The taxpayer's investments in other jurisdictions, substantial operational expenditure, and commercial rationale for the Luxembourg structure supported its position.

The decision establishes meaningful evidentiary standards for PPT application. Structural features such as holding company incorporation or investment routing through treaty jurisdictions do not automatically trigger PPT denial. Authorities must demonstrate purpose through evidence, not merely assert abuse based on structure.

### 5.3. Indofood (UK, 2006)

The England and Wales Court of Appeal decision in Indofood International Finance Ltd v. JP Morgan Chase Bank established the beneficial ownership standard that operates alongside Articles 1 and 29. An Indonesian group issued bonds through a Mauritian SPV to reduce withholding tax from twenty percent to ten percent under the Indonesia-Mauritius treaty.

The Court held that "beneficial owner" has an international fiscal meaning not derived from domestic law. The Mauritian SPV was not beneficial owner because it was bound to pass interest through to bondholders, functioning as an administrator rather than enjoying direct benefit from the income.

Indofood demonstrates how beneficial ownership requirements in Articles 10-12 operate as a third layer of anti-abuse protection. Conduit entities lacking genuine entitlement to income cannot claim treaty benefits, regardless of residence status or Article 29 compliance.

## 6. OECD vs UN Model Differences

### 6.1. Article 1 Alignment

Article 1 is identical in both the OECD and UN Models. Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 contain the same text, reflecting consensus that personal scope provisions should be uniform. Both Models recognise that threshold questions of treaty access should not differ based on whether treaty partners are developed or developing countries.

### 6.2. Article 29 Variations

Article 29 provisions differ between the Models in emphasis rather than fundamental structure. Both Models include the Principal Purpose Test in paragraph 9 and offer LOB provisions as an option. However, the UN Model recognises that developing countries may have limited administrative capacity to apply detailed LOB provisions and offers simplified versions.

The more significant differences lie in substantive provisions that affect treaty access indirectly. The UN Model preserves greater source State taxing rights through lower PE thresholds (six months for construction versus OECD's twelve months), services PE provisions, retained Article 14 on independent personal services, and unique provisions for technical services (Article 12A) and automated digital services (Article 12B).

These source taxation provisions reduce the incentive for treaty shopping by ensuring source States can tax more income regardless of treaty routing. If source States can tax technical service fees under Article 12A without requiring a PE, the benefit of routing through favourable treaty jurisdictions diminishes.

### 6.3. Article 4(3) Dual Residence

The Models differ on dual resident entity treatment. The OECD Model (post-2017) provides for competent authority determination considering place of effective management, incorporation, and other factors. Failure to reach agreement results in denial of treaty benefits except as specifically agreed.

The UN Model retains the pre-2017 automatic test based on place of effective management. This provides certainty over flexibility, reflecting developing country preference for workable rules rather than flexible standards requiring bilateral negotiation for each case.

## 7. Practical Application Issues

### 7.1. Burden of Proof Allocation

Practical application of Articles 1 and 29 raises burden of proof questions throughout the analysis. For Article 1 residence, taxpayers typically bear the burden of establishing they are residents of a Contracting State, usually through tax residency certificates.

For Article 29 PPT, the SC Lowy decision establishes that authorities bear the initial burden of demonstrating that obtaining benefits was a principal purpose. Once authorities establish principal purpose concerns, the burden shifts to taxpayers to demonstrate that granting benefits accords with object and purpose. This allocation ensures authorities cannot presume abuse while giving taxpayers opportunity to justify their arrangements.

For LOB provisions, application is more straightforward. Objective tests—ownership percentages, base erosion ratios, business activity levels—can be verified from documentary evidence without subjective assessment.

### 7.2. Documentation and Evidence

Taxpayers should maintain contemporaneous documentation supporting the commercial rationale for structures. Minutes of board meetings, internal memoranda, feasibility studies, and correspondence with advisors can establish that tax efficiency was one consideration among genuine commercial purposes. Such documentation proves invaluable if authorities later challenge arrangements under PPT.

The timing of structure implementation relative to tax-motivated transactions affects PPT analysis. Entities established immediately before significant transactions, with minimal operations and no commercial purpose apart from treaty access, face greater scrutiny than long-standing entities with established business activities.

## 8. Recent Developments

### 8.1. CBDT Circular 1/2025 (India)

India's Central Board of Direct Taxes issued Circular 1/2025 in January 2025 clarifying PPT application in Indian treaties. The PPT applies prospectively from treaty effective dates, with shares acquired before April 2017 grandfathered from PPT scrutiny. This addresses the interaction between treaty-based PPT and domestic GAAR provisions, suggesting earlier domestic anti-avoidance principles apply to pre-PPT arrangements.

The prospective application approach provides transitional certainty for pre-existing investments. Other jurisdictions have similarly adopted prospective approaches, recognising that retroactive application would create uncertainty and potentially violate legitimate expectations based on treaty language at the time investments were made.

### 8.2. 2025 OECD Model Update

The November 2025 OECD Model update maintained existing Articles 1 and 29 provisions without substantive modification. The update addressed emerging issues including remote working (Article 5 Commentary), natural resources provisions, and transfer pricing clarifications, but the treaty access framework remains as established in 2017.

### 8.3. UN Framework Convention

The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, initiated through General Assembly Resolution 79/235 in December 2024, may produce alternative approaches to treaty access questions. The convention envisions comprehensive approaches more responsive to developing country interests, potentially including enhanced source taxation provisions that reduce incentives for treaty shopping. Whether this initiative complements or competes with OECD-based standards remains to be seen as negotiations progress through 2027.
