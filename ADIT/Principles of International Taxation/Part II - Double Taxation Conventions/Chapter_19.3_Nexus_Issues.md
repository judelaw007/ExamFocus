# Chapter 19.3: Nexus Issues in the Digital Economy

## 1. Introduction: The Nexus Challenge

### 1.1. Traditional PE Limitations

The permanent establishment concept, developed for a physical economy where businesses required fixed premises to serve foreign markets, faces fundamental challenges in the digital age. Article 5 of the OECD Model establishes taxable nexus through a fixed place of business through which an enterprise wholly or partly carries on its business. Digital enterprises—online platforms, streaming services, social media networks, and cloud computing providers—generate substantial revenues from customers worldwide without establishing any physical presence meeting this threshold.

The disconnect between economic activity and physical presence creates asymmetry: enterprises derive significant value from market jurisdictions while remaining beyond those jurisdictions' taxing reach. This gap between value creation and tax liability has driven a decade of reform efforts, producing multiple competing solutions that remain imperfectly coordinated.

### 1.2. Scale Without Mass

Digital businesses achieve global reach through what the OECD Action 1 Report termed "scale without mass." A single platform can serve billions of users across every jurisdiction with marginal cost per additional user approaching zero. Traditional businesses required proportional physical investment—warehouses, employees, retail premises—to expand geographically. Digital businesses require only servers and software, enabling revenue generation vastly disproportionate to local infrastructure.

This characteristic undermines permanent establishment concepts designed for businesses needing local presence to operate. The three cumulative requirements—place of business, geographic and temporal fixity, and business conducted through that place—presume physical operations that digital businesses simply do not require (covered in December 2024).

## 2. BEPS Action 7 PE Reforms

### 2.1. Anti-Fragmentation Rules

BEPS Action 7, implemented through MLI Articles 12-15 and incorporated into the 2017 OECD Model, addressed artificial PE avoidance through fragmentation strategies. Prior rules allowed enterprises to divide cohesive operations into separate activities, each falling within Article 5(4) preparatory or auxiliary exceptions. A business might establish separate entities for storage, display, delivery, and customer service—activities preparatory or auxiliary individually but constituting core business collectively.

Article 5(4.1) introduced anti-fragmentation rules preventing this circumvention. Activities must be genuinely preparatory or auxiliary considering the overall business, not evaluated in isolation. Where an enterprise or closely related enterprises conduct complementary activities at the same location, the exception applies only if the combined activity remains preparatory or auxiliary. Fifty-four MLI jurisdictions adopted these provisions, covering over five hundred bilateral treaty relationships.

The reforms specifically target digital business arrangements where warehousing, packaging, and delivery operations were artificially separated to avoid PE status while conducting substantial commercial activity. The anti-fragmentation approach addresses the structural exploitation without creating new nexus concepts.

### 2.2. Commissionnaire and Agency PE

Action 7 also expanded dependent agent PE provisions targeting commissionnaire arrangements. Digital businesses commonly used intermediaries who negotiated contracts, managed customer relationships, and processed orders without formal authority to conclude contracts—avoiding the traditional dependent agent PE threshold.

The revised Article 5(5) applies where an agent habitually plays the principal role leading to contract conclusion, even without formal signing authority. Contracts routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise trigger PE exposure regardless of who formally signs. This functional approach captures arrangements where local agents conduct substantive negotiations but enterprises retain nominal contracting authority.

The independent agent exception in Article 5(6) was correspondingly narrowed. Agents acting exclusively or almost exclusively for closely related enterprises cannot qualify as independent, closing arrangements where captive agents claimed independent status to avoid creating PE for their principals.

## 3. Alternative Nexus Proposals

### 3.1. Significant Economic Presence

Several jurisdictions have introduced Significant Economic Presence concepts establishing taxable nexus through economic activity rather than physical presence. India pioneered this approach through Section 9(1)(i) Explanation 2A of the Income Tax Act, introducing SEP with effect from April 2022.

The Indian thresholds establish nexus where a non-resident's aggregate payments from Indian transactions exceed two crore rupees annually, or where the non-resident systematically and continuously solicits business from three hundred thousand or more Indian users. Either threshold independently creates business connection, bringing the enterprise within Indian taxing jurisdiction regardless of physical presence.

Kenya implemented SEP from December 2024 at three percent of gross turnover, replacing its earlier digital services tax. Colombia's Decree 2039 of 2023 introduced SEP with ten percent withholding or three percent gross income taxation options. Pakistan's Finance Act 2024 expanded business connection definitions to include SEP from July 2024.

The critical limitation of domestic SEP provisions is treaty override. Where bilateral treaties define PE using traditional Article 5 language, treaty-protected enterprises can claim that SEP provisions do not apply—the treaty PE definition limits source-country taxing rights regardless of domestic law expansions. This gap means SEP provisions primarily affect enterprises without treaty protection, creating inequitable treatment between treaty-benefited and non-treaty enterprises (covered in June 2024).

### 3.2. Server PE and Virtual Presence

The OECD Commentary addresses whether servers constitute permanent establishments. A server physically located and operated by an enterprise at a fixed location may qualify as PE if the enterprise conducts business through it—the server represents tangible equipment at a fixed place. However, a website alone cannot constitute PE because it lacks physical presence; websites are merely software combinations residing on servers.

The distinction matters for digital businesses. Enterprises controlling servers conducting core business functions face PE exposure in server locations. Enterprises hosting websites on third-party servers avoid PE because they lack physical equipment at fixed locations. Most digital enterprises structure operations using ISP hosting arrangements specifically to avoid server PE exposure—the ISP maintains operational control, preventing attribution to the hosted enterprise.

India has argued for "virtual service PE" concepts where enterprises providing services remotely create taxable presence through electronic service delivery. This approach remains controversial and lacks standardised international acceptance, creating double taxation risks where jurisdictions differ on virtual PE recognition.

## 4. Pillar One Market-Based Nexus

### 4.1. Amount A Revenue Nexus

Pillar One Amount A represents the most significant departure from traditional nexus concepts—establishing taxable presence through market revenue alone, without any physical presence requirement. The draft Multilateral Convention establishes nexus for multinationals with consolidated revenue exceeding twenty billion euros and profit margins above ten percent.

For qualifying enterprises, nexus arises in jurisdictions generating revenue exceeding specified thresholds: one million euros for countries with GDP above forty billion euros, or two hundred fifty thousand euros for smaller economies. Twenty-five percent of residual profits—profits exceeding the ten percent margin threshold—are reallocated to market jurisdictions proportionate to revenue sourced there.

This revenue-based nexus fundamentally transforms international tax architecture. Taxing rights attach to customer locations rather than enterprise locations, reversing the traditional source-residence allocation. Market jurisdictions gain taxing rights regardless of how enterprises structure operations, eliminating incentives for artificial arrangements avoiding physical presence.

### 4.2. Implementation Status

Pillar One implementation has substantially stalled. The multilateral convention text published in October 2023 requires ratification by at least thirty jurisdictions accounting for sixty percent of in-scope ultimate parent entities. Entry into force originally targeted 2025 but appears unlikely given current negotiation status.

The January 2025 US withdrawal from the OECD Inclusive Framework significantly reduced implementation momentum. The withdrawal followed US concerns that approximately seventy percent of reallocated profits would derive from US enterprises, creating estimated US revenue losses of over one billion dollars. Without US participation, Amount A's effectiveness is fundamentally compromised given the concentration of in-scope enterprises under US jurisdiction.

Amount B—simplified transfer pricing for baseline distribution activities—represents the tangible Pillar One achievement. Published in February 2024, Amount B provides pricing matrices establishing arm's length ranges from 1.5 to 5.5 percent return-on-sales. Jurisdictions may elect application from January 2025, providing immediate benefit for developing countries lacking transfer pricing capacity.

## 5. UN Model Alternatives

### 5.1. Article 12B Automated Digital Services

The UN Model addresses digital nexus through Article 12B, added in April 2021, permitting source taxation of automated digital services without requiring permanent establishment. Covered services include online advertising, digital marketplaces, social media platforms, cloud computing, search engines, standardised online teaching, and user data sales.

The provision offers taxation alternatives. Gross-basis withholding applies at bilaterally negotiated rates, typically three to four percent. Alternatively, a net-basis approach treats thirty percent of gross payments as deemed income subject to standard corporate rates—effectively reducing the tax base while applying normal rates.

Article 12B applies to all digital service providers regardless of size, contrasting sharply with Pillar One Amount A's narrow scope affecting fewer than one hundred companies. This universal applicability makes Article 12B potentially more significant for developing country revenue protection, though implementation remains limited.

Despite four years since UN Model adoption, virtually no bilateral treaties have incorporated Article 12B provisions. Developed countries resist inclusion, preferring the narrower OECD approach. The "minimal human involvement" test creates classification ambiguity that may discourage adoption. This implementation gap means Article 12B remains primarily aspirational rather than operational.

### 5.2. Services PE Provisions

The UN Model also provides lower PE thresholds through services PE provisions. Article 5(3)(b) creates PE where an enterprise furnishes services through employees present for more than one hundred eighty-three days within any twelve-month period. This threshold applies cumulatively across connected projects, preventing fragmentation to avoid the limit.

The services PE concept addresses situations where enterprises provide substantial services without fixed premises—consultants, technical advisors, and project personnel who work at client sites rather than dedicated offices. The UN threshold is notably lower than typical OECD treaty provisions requiring six months or longer presence.

## 6. Unilateral Measures

### 6.1. Digital Services Taxes

The slow progress of multilateral solutions prompted widespread unilateral digital services taxes. France implemented three percent DST on digital advertising and online intermediation. The United Kingdom maintains two percent DST on similar activities. Italy, Spain, Austria, and other European jurisdictions implemented rates ranging from 1.5 to 7.5 percent.

Canada enacted three percent DST in 2024 with retrospective effect from January 2022, though subsequently withdrew in June 2025 amid trade negotiations. The standstill agreement under which 138 jurisdictions agreed not to impose new DSTs expired on 31 December 2024 without Pillar One implementation, releasing countries to resume unilateral measures (covered in December 2023).

DSTs operate as gross revenue taxes rather than income taxes, creating potential juridical double taxation without relief mechanisms. Enterprises may face DST in market jurisdictions, income tax in residence jurisdictions, and separate DSTs across multiple markets—all on the same underlying activity.

### 6.2. Equalization Levies

India's equalization levies represented the most aggressive unilateral approach—six percent on digital advertising and two percent on e-commerce transactions, structured outside the income tax system to avoid treaty coverage. These levies applied regardless of PE, treaty benefits, or other limitations that might constrain income taxation.

Both Indian levies have now been abolished—the e-commerce levy in August 2024 and the digital advertising levy in April 2025. The withdrawal reflects alignment with the Two-Pillar framework and recognition that dual levy-plus-GST obligations created excessive compliance burden for digital enterprises. The abolition simplifies overseas supplier compliance to GST registration only.

## 7. Current Status and Fragmentation

The digital economy nexus framework remains highly fragmented across competing approaches. Traditional PE rules continue applying where treaties use pre-BEPS language. BEPS Action 7 reforms apply where MLI modifications have taken effect. Domestic SEP provisions apply to non-treaty enterprises in implementing jurisdictions. Pillar One Amount A remains stalled. UN Model Article 12B lacks bilateral implementation.

The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, initiated through General Assembly Resolution 79/235 in December 2024, may provide an alternative forum for nexus standardisation. Intergovernmental negotiations through 2027 will address cross-border service taxation, potentially drawing on Article 12B concepts that developed countries have resisted in bilateral contexts.

Multinational digital enterprises now navigate multiple overlapping nexus regimes—traditional PE, reformed PE, SEP, DSTs, and platform liability rules simultaneously applicable across different jurisdictions. This fragmentation creates substantial compliance burden while leaving fundamental questions unresolved regarding how digital value creation should establish taxable presence.
