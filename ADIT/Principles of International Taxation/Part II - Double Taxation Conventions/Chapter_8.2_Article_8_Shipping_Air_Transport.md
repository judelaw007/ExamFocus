## EXAM INTELLIGENCE
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Syllabus Area: II.H.2 - Shipping and air transport profits – Article 8,
               OECD MTC and UN MDTC
Syllabus Level: 3 (Advanced Knowledge)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Exam Frequency: MODERATE - Often appears in context of other articles
Recent Appearances:
  • June 2022: Article 8 in context of Article 21 interaction
  • December 2022: Article 13(3) consistency with Article 8
  • June 2025: Shipping excluded from GloBE/Pillar Two

Strategic Priority: ★★★☆☆ IMPORTANT
- Lex specialis to Article 7 (takes precedence)
- POEM (not residence) as connecting factor - distinctive feature
- UN Model Alternative B is key distinguishing concept
- Links to Article 13(3) for capital gains, Article 15(3) for employment
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1. INTRODUCTION: SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT

### 1.1 Purpose and Rationale

Article 8 provides **special rules** for the taxation of profits from international shipping and air transport. The rationale for separate treatment includes:

- **Practical difficulties**: Ships and aircraft operate across multiple jurisdictions in a single voyage
- **Administrative burden**: Apportioning profits to each country visited would be impractical
- **Historical consensus**: Since the 1920s, international agreement that residence (POEM) state should have exclusive rights
- **Industry characteristics**: Mobile assets, multinational operations, thin profit margins

### 1.2 Relationship with Article 7

Article 8 is **lex specialis** to Article 7 - it takes precedence for qualifying transport income:

```
ARTICLE 8 vs ARTICLE 7 RELATIONSHIP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

GENERAL RULE (Article 7):
  Business profits → Residence state (or PE state if PE exists)

SPECIAL RULE (Article 8):
  Shipping/air transport profits → POEM state EXCLUSIVELY
  (No PE analysis required; source states cannot tax)

HIERARCHY:
  If income qualifies under Article 8 → Article 8 applies
  If income does NOT qualify → Falls back to Article 7

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 2. ARTICLE 8 TEXT (OECD MTC 2017)

### 2.1 Full Text

**Article 8(1):**
> "Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the **place of effective management** of the enterprise is situated."

**Article 8(2):**
> "If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the Contracting State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is a resident."

**Article 8(3):**
> "The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency."

### 2.2 Structure Overview

| Paragraph | Content | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **8(1)** | Main rule | Exclusive POEM state taxation |
| **8(2)** | Ships at sea | Deemed POEM location |
| **8(3)** | Pooling arrangements | Extends rule to consortia |

---

## 3. KEY CONCEPTS

### 3.1 Place of Effective Management (POEM)

Unlike most treaty provisions that use "residence," Article 8 uses **Place of Effective Management (POEM)** as the connecting factor.

**Why POEM?**
- Historical: Many shipping companies incorporated in flag-of-convenience states
- POEM ensures taxation where genuine management decisions occur
- Prevents ships flying flags of convenience from escaping taxation entirely

**POEM vs Residence:**
```
POEM vs RESIDENCE - KEY DISTINCTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESIDENCE (Article 4):
  Where enterprise is "liable to tax" under domestic law
  Usually: Place of incorporation or central management

POEM (Article 8):
  Where "key management and commercial decisions...are in
  substance made" (see Article 4 Commentary [24])
  Focus: Actual decision-making location

PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE:
  Shipping Co incorporated in Country A (low-tax flag state)
  But managed from Country B (where directors meet, decisions made)

  Under residence: Taxable in Country A
  Under POEM: Taxable in Country B

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.2 "International Traffic"

**Article 3(1)(e) Definition:**
> "'International traffic' means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise that has its place of effective management in a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State."

**Key elements:**
- Transport must cross borders (not purely domestic)
- Enterprise must have POEM in a Contracting State
- Domestic-only transport in the other state is excluded

```
WHAT QUALIFIES AS "INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ COVERED:
  • Voyage from Country A to Country B
  • Voyage from Country A to Country B to Country C
  • Cruise ship departing and returning to Country A via Country B

✗ NOT COVERED (excluded from Article 8):
  • Ship operating ONLY between ports within Country B
    (where enterprise has no POEM)
  • Purely domestic airline routes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.3 "Operation" of Ships or Aircraft

The term "operation" is interpreted broadly (Commentary [4]):

**Covers:**
- Ownership and direct operation
- Chartering out ships/aircraft on bareboat or time charter
- Sub-chartering arrangements
- Container operations ancillary to shipping

**Does NOT cover:**
- Mere ownership without operation (passive investment)
- Ship/aircraft leasing as main business (not transport)

### 3.4 Ships at Sea - Article 8(2)

A special rule addresses POEM location when management occurs aboard a ship:

**Deemed POEM:**
1. **First preference**: Home harbour of the ship
2. **If no home harbour**: State of which operator is resident

This prevents the absurd result of a ship's POEM being "at sea" and therefore in no state.

---

## 4. SCOPE: WHAT INCOME IS COVERED

### 4.1 Primary Activities

Article 8 covers profits from:
- Passenger transport
- Cargo/freight transport
- Mail transport

### 4.2 Ancillary Activities

The Commentary confirms that **ancillary activities** connected to international traffic are also covered:

| Activity | Covered? | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Excess baggage charges | ✓ | Directly connected to passenger transport |
| On-board sales (duty-free) | ✓ | Incidental to transport |
| Advertising on aircraft | ✓ | Ancillary to main operation |
| Container leasing (own use) | ✓ | Integral to cargo transport |
| Hotel accommodation (airline) | △ | Only if short-term, incidental |
| Bus transport to airport | △ | Only if operated by airline |
| Ship repair services | ✗ | Separate business activity |
| Aircraft manufacturing | ✗ | Not transport operation |

### 4.3 Pooling and Joint Ventures - Article 8(3)

Article 8(3) extends the POEM rule to profits from:
- **Pool arrangements**: Airlines sharing routes/capacity
- **Joint businesses**: Shipping consortia
- **International operating agencies**: Multi-country transport bodies

Each participant is taxable on their share in their POEM state.

## 5. UN MODEL DIFFERENCES

### 5.1 Two Alternatives

The UN Model provides **two alternatives** for Article 8, reflecting the tension between developed and developing countries:

| Alternative | Air Transport | Shipping | Reflects |
|-------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Alternative A** | Exclusive POEM | Exclusive POEM | OECD approach |
| **Alternative B** | Exclusive POEM | Source may tax | Developing country concerns |

### 5.2 Alternative A (OECD Approach)

UN Article 8 Alternative A mirrors the OECD Model - exclusive taxation in the POEM state for both shipping and air transport profits.

### 5.3 Alternative B (Source Taxation for Shipping)

**UN Article 8 Alternative B** allows **source state taxation of shipping profits**:

> "If such activities in the other Contracting State are **more than casual**, such profits may be taxed in that other State. The profits to be taxed in that other State shall be determined on the basis of an **appropriate allocation** of the overall net profits derived by the enterprise from its shipping operations."

```
UN MODEL ALTERNATIVE B - SHIPPING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONDITION: Activities in source state are "more than casual"

IF MET:
  Source state MAY tax shipping profits
  Profits determined by:
    • Appropriate allocation of overall net profits, OR
    • Percentage of gross receipts (e.g., 3%)

TAX CALCULATION OPTIONS:
  1. Net basis: Allocate net profits; apply domestic CIT rate
  2. Gross basis: Apply agreed percentage to gross receipts
     (whichever results in lower tax)

RATIONALE:
  • Developing countries often net importers of shipping services
  • Exclusive residence taxation benefits developed countries
  • Alternative B provides more balanced allocation

ADOPTION:
  • Primarily South/South-East Asia: India, Bangladesh, Indonesia,
    Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Pakistan
  • Low adoption elsewhere due to complexity

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5.4 Air Transport Under Alternative B

Even under Alternative B, **air transport retains exclusive POEM state taxation**. Only shipping is subject to potential source taxation.

**Rationale**: Airlines have stronger political voice; aircraft operations differ from shipping.

### 5.5 2025 UN Model Update

The 2025 UN Model update:
- Elevated the source taxation approach
- Former Alternative A (OECD-style) now becomes Alternative B
- New Alternative A provides source taxation for both shipping and air transport
- Reflects developing country push for greater source taxation rights

## 6. INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ARTICLES

### 6.1 Article 13(3): Capital Gains on Ships/Aircraft

Article 13(3) mirrors Article 8's approach for capital gains:

> "Gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable **only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated**."

**Consistency principle**: If operating profits taxable in POEM state, gains on disposal should be too.

### 6.2 Article 15(3): Employment Income

Article 15(3) provides a corresponding rule for employees:

> "Remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic... may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the **place of effective management** of the enterprise is situated."

**Note**: "May be taxed" (not "shall be taxable only") - so residence state can also tax, but POEM state has priority.

### 6.3 Article 21: Other Income

If income does NOT qualify under Article 8, it may fall under:
- Article 7 (business profits) - if business income
- Article 21 (other income) - residual category

**June 2022 exam reference**: Where profits do not fall within Article 8, they will fall within Article 7.

---

## 7. PRACTICAL ISSUES

### 7.1 Bareboat Charters

**Bareboat (demise) charter**: Ship owner leases vessel to charterer who operates it.

**Tax treatment:**
- Rental income to owner: May not qualify as "operation" - could be Article 7 or Article 12 (royalties)
- Operating profits to charterer: Article 8 applies (charterer operates in international traffic)

### 7.2 Time Charters

**Time charter**: Ship owner provides vessel and crew; charterer directs voyages.

**Tax treatment:**
- Owner's income: Article 8 applies (owner still "operates" the ship)
- This is the majority view in the Commentary

### 7.3 Code-Sharing Arrangements

Airlines frequently share capacity through code-sharing. Each airline's share of profits is taxable in its own POEM state under Article 8(3).

## 8. EXAM APPLICATION

### 8.1 How Article 8 Appears in Exams

Article 8 typically appears:
1. **In interaction questions** - Relationship with Articles 7, 13, 15, 21
2. **In OECD vs UN comparisons** - Alternative A vs Alternative B
3. **POEM identification** - Where is effective management?
4. **Pillar Two context** - Shipping often excluded from GloBE rules

### 8.2 Answer Framework

```
ARTICLE 8 EXAM FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. IDENTIFY THE INCOME TYPE (2 marks)
   "The income is from operation of ships/aircraft..."
   "This is international traffic because [crosses borders]..."

2. CONFIRM ARTICLE 8 APPLIES (2-3 marks)
   "Article 8 is lex specialis to Article 7..."
   "The enterprise operates in international traffic..."
   "Article 8 therefore applies rather than Article 7..."

3. IDENTIFY POEM (2-3 marks)
   "The place of effective management is in [State X]..."
   "This is where key management decisions are made..."
   (Note: POEM may differ from place of incorporation)

4. APPLY THE RULE (2-3 marks)
   OECD/UN Alt A: "Profits taxable ONLY in [POEM state]"
   UN Alt B: "Source state may tax if activities more than casual"

5. CONSIDER RELATED PROVISIONS (if relevant) (2-3 marks)
   • Article 13(3) for capital gains on ships/aircraft
   • Article 15(3) for crew employment income
