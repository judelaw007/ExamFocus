# Chapter 8.2: Shipping and Air Transport Profits – Article 8, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

## II.H.2.1 The Special Nature of International Transport

Article 8 of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides special rules for taxation of profits from international shipping and air transport operations. This distinctive treatment addresses practical challenges arising from the highly mobile nature of these industries.

The rationale for separate treatment reflects several factors. Ships and aircraft operate across multiple jurisdictions in a single voyage, making profit apportionment to each country administratively impractical. The industry is characterized by mobile assets, multinational operations, and thin profit margins that cannot bear the compliance burden of multiple tax filings. Historical consensus dating to the League of Nations work in the 1920s recognized that exclusive taxation in the state of management would best serve international trade.

### II.H.2.1.1 Lex Specialis Relationship with Article 7

Article 8 operates as lex specialis to Article 7, taking precedence for qualifying transport income. Where income qualifies under Article 8, the permanent establishment analysis under Article 7 becomes irrelevant.

Under Article 7, business profits are taxable in the residence state unless the enterprise maintains a permanent establishment in the source state. However, for shipping and air transport profits qualifying under Article 8, such profits shall be taxable only in the state where the place of effective management is situated. Source states are entirely precluded from taxation, regardless of activity levels within their borders. If income does not qualify under Article 8, it falls back to Article 7 and the permanent establishment framework applies.

## II.H.2.2 The OECD Model Provision

Article 8(1) establishes the fundamental rule:

> "Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated."

This creates exclusive taxing rights for the place of effective management (POEM) state, denying source states any right to tax.

Article 8(2) addresses ships managed aboard the vessel itself:

> "If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the Contracting State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is a resident."

This ensures ships managed at sea have a definable tax jurisdiction, using home harbour as first preference and operator's residence as fallback.

Article 8(3) extends the basic rule to cooperative arrangements:

> "The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency."

Each participant's share of profits is taxable in that participant's POEM state.

## II.H.2.3 Core Concepts Under Article 8

### II.H.2.3.1 Place of Effective Management (POEM)

Unlike most treaty provisions relying on residence, Article 8 uses place of effective management as its connecting factor. This addresses the historical practice of shipping companies incorporating in flag-of-convenience states while being managed elsewhere.

POEM focuses on where key management and commercial decisions are in substance made. This requires examining where directors meet and make strategic decisions, where senior management is based, and where operational control is exercised. The functional approach emphasizes actual decision-making patterns rather than corporate formalities such as place of incorporation or registered office.

The use of POEM rather than residence prevents ships flying flags of convenience from escaping taxation. By anchoring taxing rights to POEM, Article 8 ensures taxation occurs where genuine management decisions are made.

### II.H.2.3.2 "International Traffic" Defined

Article 3(1)(e) defines international traffic as transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise with POEM in a contracting state, except when operated solely between places in the other contracting state.

The transport must cross international borders. Operations confined solely to ports within the source state are excluded from Article 8. The rationale is that purely domestic operations in the source state resemble domestic businesses and should face the same taxation as local competitors.

### II.H.2.3.3 "Operation" Interpreted Broadly

The term "operation" receives broad interpretation. It includes direct ownership and operation, bareboat charter arrangements, time charters, and sub-chartering arrangements. Container operations ancillary to shipping also qualify. However, mere passive ownership of vessels as investments does not constitute operation. The enterprise must be engaged in the transport business rather than merely earning rental income.

### II.H.2.3.4 Ships at Sea - Article 8(2)

Article 8(2) prevents the absurd result that POEM is "at sea" with no state jurisdiction. First preference goes to the home harbour where the ship is registered or habitually returns. If no home harbour exists, the test looks to the operator's residence state.

## II.H.2.4 Scope of Article 8: Primary and Ancillary Activities

### II.H.2.4.1 Primary Transport Activities

Article 8 covers passenger transport, cargo and freight transport, and mail transport across international borders when performed by an enterprise with POEM in a contracting state.

### II.H.2.4.2 The Ancillary Activities Test

Ancillary activities connected to international traffic are covered by exclusive POEM state taxation. For an activity to qualify as ancillary, it must satisfy a dual test: it must contribute only a minor portion of overall revenues and be closely related to the core transport operation.

Excess baggage charges and on-board duty-free sales qualify as directly connected to passenger transport. Advertising on aircraft is similarly ancillary. Container leasing for the company's own cargo operations falls within Article 8's scope. Hotel accommodation provided by airlines qualifies only if short-term and incidental to transport service. Extended hotel operations or services provided independently constitute separate business activities subject to Article 7.

The boundary between ancillary activities and separate business operations can be fact-intensive. When a shipping company provides door-to-door delivery using road transport from port to customer premises, courts assess whether inland carriage is sufficiently integrated with the sea voyage. The test requires both quantitative assessment of profit contribution and qualitative analysis of the relationship to core shipping. If road delivery represents a substantial profit center or operates independently, it may constitute a separate business taxable under Article 7. This ancillary activities analysis, particularly for road delivery services provided in conjunction with shipping operations, was examined under the UN Model 2021 framework (ADIT December 2025).

Ship repair services to third parties and aircraft manufacturing fall outside Article 8 as separate business activities.

### II.H.2.4.3 Pooling and Joint Ventures - Article 8(3)

Modern international transport frequently involves collaborative arrangements. Airlines share routes and capacity through alliances; shipping companies form consortia to pool vessels. Each participant remains taxable on its share of profits in its POEM state. Article 8(3) ensures exclusive POEM state taxation extends to these cooperative structures.

Case law has examined Article 8(3)'s boundaries. Lufthansa v India confirmed that pooling arrangements under the Interline Traffic Agreement Pool (IATP) qualified for Article 8 treatment where genuine reciprocity existed. However, in British Airways v India, Article 8 protection was denied because British Airways provided ground handling and engineering services to numerous airlines but received no reciprocal services in return—the absence of mutuality meant it failed to qualify as a true pool participant under Article 8(3).

## II.H.2.5 The UN Model: Balancing Residence and Source Taxation

### II.H.2.5.1 Two Alternatives in the UN Model

The UN Model reflects tension between developed and developing countries over taxing rights. Developed countries favor exclusive POEM state taxation. Developing countries, often net importers of transport services, seek greater source taxation rights. The UN Model provides Alternative A (OECD approach) and Alternative B (source taxation for shipping).

### II.H.2.5.2 Alternative A - OECD Approach

UN Model Article 8 Alternative A mirrors the OECD provision: profits from operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the POEM state. This maintains administrative simplicity.

### II.H.2.5.3 Alternative B - Source Taxation for Shipping

Alternative B allows source state taxation of shipping profits where activities are "more than casual," while retaining exclusive POEM state taxation for air transport. The "more than casual" threshold requires regular or substantial shipping services rather than occasional visits.

Once this threshold is met, the source state may tax an appropriate allocation of profits. The Commentary suggests allocation methods including a percentage of gross receipts (typically three percent) or allocation based on factors like port calls, cargo loaded and unloaded, or source state revenue.

Alternative B has achieved limited adoption, primarily in South and Southeast Asian treaties including India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan. Limited adoption reflects the complexity of administering source taxation and developed countries' preference for the OECD approach.

### II.H.2.5.4 Air Transport Treatment

Even under Alternative B, air transport retains exclusive POEM state taxation. Only shipping faces potential source taxation. This differential treatment reflects airlines' stronger political influence, operational differences, and concentration of ownership in developed countries.

### II.H.2.5.5 The 2025 UN Model Update

The UN Tax Committee approved significant changes during 2024-2025 representing a major shift in international transport taxation. The former Alternative A (OECD-style exclusive POEM taxation) was redesignated Alternative B. A new Alternative A was introduced extending source-based taxation to airlines for the first time, in addition to shipping.

This represents fundamental change in international consensus on airline taxation. The new Alternative A permits source countries to tax both shipping and airline profits where operations are more than casual, based on appropriate allocation of overall net profits. The elevation of source taxation to Alternative A signals growing influence of developing country perspectives. While ECOSOC approval was pending as of mid-2025, adoption in bilateral treaties is anticipated.

By contrast, the 2025 OECD Model update maintains exclusive residence-based taxation for international transport. This widening gap between OECD and UN Models reflects deeper disagreements about appropriate allocation of taxing rights.

## II.H.2.6 Article 8 in the Treaty Architecture

### II.H.2.6.1 Capital Gains on Ships and Aircraft - Article 13(3)

Article 13(3) mirrors Article 8's approach for capital gains:

> "Gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated."

This implements a consistency principle. If operating profits are taxable exclusively in the POEM state, gains on disposal should be too. The scope extends to movable property pertaining to operation, including spare parts, containers, and integral equipment.

### II.H.2.6.2 Employment Income - Article 15(3)

Article 15(3) provides that remuneration for employment aboard ships or aircraft operated in international traffic may be taxed in the POEM state. The provision uses "may be taxed" rather than "shall be taxable only," creating concurrent jurisdiction. Both the POEM state and the employee's residence state may tax, but the POEM state receives explicit rights, aligning employment taxation with treatment of enterprise profits.

### II.H.2.6.3 Residual Categories - Articles 7 and 21

If income does not qualify under Article 8, it is characterized under other treaty provisions. The most common alternative is Article 7 on business profits. Where operations are purely domestic in the source state or do not constitute "operation," Article 7 applies and profits are taxable in the source state only if a permanent establishment exists there.

This fall-back relationship was examined in the context of income not qualifying as "operation" in international traffic (ADIT June 2022). For example, rental income from bareboat charters where the owner provides only the vessel may fall outside Article 8. Such income would be analyzed under Article 7 as business profits, or possibly under Article 12 as royalties.

## II.H.2.7 Charter Arrangements and Operational Structures

### II.H.2.7.1 Bareboat (Demise) Charters

Under a bareboat charter, the owner provides only the vessel while the charterer assumes all operational responsibilities including crew, fuel, and maintenance. Because the owner has relinquished operational control, rental income may not qualify as profits from "operation" under Article 8.

The prevailing view treats bareboat charter income as falling outside Article 8. It may constitute business profits under Article 7, taxable in the source state if the owner has a permanent establishment there. Some jurisdictions characterize bareboat payments as royalties, bringing Article 12 into play. The charterer's operating profits from using the vessel in international traffic clearly fall within Article 8.

### II.H.2.7.2 Time and Voyage Charters

In a time charter, the owner provides vessel and crew, but the charterer directs routes and cargo. The majority Commentary view treats time charter income as falling within Article 8. The owner continues to "operate" the ship or aircraft despite the charterer controlling commercial deployment. Time charter income qualifies as profits from operation in international traffic subject to exclusive POEM state taxation.

Voyage charters, where the owner transports specific cargo on a defined route, even more clearly fall within Article 8. The owner retains complete operational control.

The distinction turns on operational control retained by the owner. Where the owner crews, navigates, and manages the vessel, Article 8 applies. Where the owner provides only the vessel itself, the income may fall outside Article 8.

### II.H.2.7.3 Code-Sharing and Alliance Arrangements

Airlines use code-sharing where one carrier sells tickets on another carrier's aircraft using its own flight code. Code-sharing fits within Article 8(3)'s coverage of pools and joint businesses. Each airline's share of profits is taxable in that airline's POEM state. Similar principles apply to shipping consortia and slot-sharing arrangements.

## II.H.2.8 Article 8 in the Modern Tax Landscape

### II.H.2.8.1 Shipping Exclusion from Pillar Two

The OECD's Pillar Two framework establishing a 15% global minimum tax through Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules explicitly excludes international shipping income from both the income inclusion rule and qualified domestic minimum top-up tax. This recognizes that unique characteristics justifying Article 8's special treatment apply equally in the multilateral minimum tax context.

The exclusion ensures favorable tax regimes for shipping, including tonnage tax regimes taxing based on vessel capacity rather than profits, are not disturbed by Pillar Two. These regimes typically produce effective tax rates below 15%, but Pillar Two accepts this policy choice by excluding shipping entirely from GloBE computation.

The rationale reflects practical and policy considerations. Ships operate globally with no clear connection to any jurisdiction beyond the POEM state. Attempting jurisdictional top-up taxes based on where ships call would recreate administrative problems Article 8 was designed to avoid. The shipping industry's competitive nature and thin margins led policymakers to conclude minimum taxation could adversely affect this infrastructure sector. The interaction between Article 8 and the GloBE exclusions was considered in the context of tonnage tax regimes (ADIT June 2025).

### II.H.2.8.2 Airlines Under Pillar Two

Airline income does not receive the same Pillar Two exclusion. While Article 8 provides exclusive POEM state taxation, airlines remain fully subject to Pillar Two's minimum tax requirements. A multinational airline group with operations producing effective tax rates below 15% may face top-up tax.

This differential treatment reflects policy judgments about relative mobility and tax planning opportunities. Airlines have more substantial fixed operations including hubs, maintenance facilities, and ground operations than shipping companies. Airlines are viewed as having greater capacity for profit shifting through transfer pricing. The decision to exclude shipping while including airlines demonstrates Pillar Two's exclusions are narrowly tailored.

Article 8 and Pillar Two create overlapping but distinct frameworks. Article 8 determines allocation of taxing rights between source and residence states under bilateral treaties. Pillar Two operates within that allocation to ensure minimum effective taxation of airline profits, though not shipping profits.

## II.H.2.9 Concluding Observations

Article 8 represents one of the most successful aspects of the international tax treaty framework. Exclusive taxation in the POEM state has facilitated international trade by avoiding multiple taxation and administrative complexity. The provision's stability over decades reflects genuine consensus on treatment of these highly mobile operations.

However, consensus shows signs of strain. The 2025 UN Model update extending source taxation to airlines represents developing country frustration with exclusive POEM state taxation predominantly benefiting developed countries. The differential treatment of shipping and airlines under Pillar Two demonstrates that even within the OECD framework, rationale for special treatment is being questioned and refined.

The core concepts of POEM as connecting factor, broad interpretation of "operation," and the ancillary activities test remain robust frameworks for analyzing modern fact patterns. Understanding Article 8 requires appreciating both its technical provisions and the policy tensions between administrative simplicity, fair revenue allocation, and maintaining competitive conditions in the transport sector.
