Exam Frequency: HIGH - Recent comprehensive question
Recent Appearances:
  • June 2025 Q4: COMPREHENSIVE Article 20 question (Amelie case -
                 25 marks) - maintenance grants, research payments,
                 "visiting" requirement, change of circumstances,
                 interaction with Article 21

Strategic Priority: ★★★★☆ HIGH PRIORITY
- June 2025 tested Article 20 extensively (25 marks)
- "Solely for education" requirement critical
- "Visiting" (temporary) requirement debated
- Source of payments (outside host state) key
- Interaction with Articles 15 and 21 important
- Commentary [2.1] and [3] must be known
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE ROLE OF ARTICLE 20

### 1.1 Purpose and Function

Article 20 provides a **host state exemption** for certain payments received by students and business apprentices. Unlike other distributive articles, Article 20 does not allocate taxing rights between states—instead, it **prohibits the host state from taxing** specified payments, leaving the residence state free to tax (or exempt).

### 1.2 Policy Rationale

```
WHY EXEMPT STUDENT PAYMENTS?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

UNDERLYING PURPOSES:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. EDUCATIONAL PROMOTION                                        │
│    • Encourage international education and training            │
│    • Remove tax barriers to student mobility                   │
│    • Facilitate cultural and academic exchange                 │
│                                                                 │
│ 2. PROTECT HOME STATE'S INVESTMENT                              │
│    • Home state often sponsors students through grants         │
│    • Prevent host state from "capturing" these funds          │
│    • Ensure sponsoring state's generosity benefits student    │
│                                                                 │
│ 3. ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLICITY                                    │
│    • Students typically have limited means                     │
│    • Avoid complex host state tax compliance                   │
│    • Student stays are temporary                                │
│                                                                 │
│ 4. FAIRNESS                                                     │
│    • Maintenance payments often barely sufficient              │
│    • Taxing would create hardship                               │
│    • Students are not economically exploiting host state      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

As noted in Commentary: The purpose is to ensure that "the generosity
of governments or public bodies towards students of their own State"
is not "diverted into the treasuries of the foreign states where the
students pursue their studies" (Herm, 1996; June 2025 exam reference)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 1.3 Unique Nature of Article 20

Article 20 operates **differently** from other OECD Model provisions:

```
HOW ARTICLE 20 DIFFERS FROM OTHER ARTICLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. NOT A TAXING RIGHTS ALLOCATION                               │
│    • Does not say who CAN tax                                   │
│    • Only says host state CANNOT tax                            │
│    • Home state may or may not tax under domestic law          │
│                                                                 │
│ 2. RESIDENCE NOT DETERMINATIVE                                  │
│    • Works regardless of whether student becomes resident      │
│      of host state                                              │
│    • Key is they WERE resident of other state immediately      │
│      before visiting                                            │
│                                                                 │
│ 3. MAY RESULT IN DOUBLE NON-TAXATION                            │
│    • Host state prohibited from taxing                          │
│    • Home state may exempt under domestic law                   │
│    • This is an ACCEPTED consequence (Lang, 2010)              │
│                                                                 │
│ 4. NO RELIEF OBLIGATION                                         │
│    • Does not require home state to provide DTR                │
│    • Simply removes host state's taxing right                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 1.4 Historical Development

- **1963 Draft Convention**: Original version used "formerly" rather than "immediately before visiting"
- **1977 Model Convention**: Amended to current wording
- The change from "formerly" to "immediately before visiting" tightened the temporal requirement

## 2. ARTICLE 20 TEXT AND STRUCTURE (OECD MTC 2017)

### 2.1 Full Text

**Article 20:**
> "Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of his education or training receives for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State."

### 3.2 "Immediately Before Visiting"

```
TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"is or was IMMEDIATELY BEFORE VISITING a resident of the other
Contracting State"

INTERPRETATION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TWO ALTERNATIVE TIMINGS:                                        │
│                                                                 │
│ 1. "IS" a resident: Currently resident of home state           │
│    → Retains residence throughout studies                       │
│                                                                 │
│ 2. "WAS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE": Was resident just before visiting │
│    → May have lost home state residence upon departure         │
│    → Still qualifies if resident at time of departure          │
│                                                                 │
│ "IMMEDIATELY BEFORE" means:                                     │
│ → Close temporal connection to visit                            │
│ → No intervening period of residence elsewhere                 │
│ → Cannot have been resident of third state in between          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLE (June 2025 Amelie case):
Amelie was resident of State A before moving to State B for
postgraduate studies → satisfies "immediately before visiting"

### 3.3 "Visiting" - The Temporary Stay Requirement

**EXAM CRITICAL**: The June 2025 exam (Amelie case) extensively tested this requirement.

```
"VISITING" - TEMPORARY STAY REQUIREMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE CONCEPT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "Visiting" implies a TEMPORARY presence                         │
│                                                                 │
│ • Not permanent settlement                                      │
│ • Intention to return or move on                                │
│ • Time-limited educational programme                            │
│                                                                 │
│ IMPORTANT: Article 20 does not specify a TIME LIMIT            │
│ (unlike US Model which has specific time limits)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WHEN "VISITING" MAY CEASE (June 2025 exam issues):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Changed circumstances that may indicate no longer "visiting":   │
│                                                                 │
│ • Applying for permanent residence visa                         │
│ • Moving in with local partner/spouse                           │
│ • Acquiring permanent accommodation                             │
│ • Taking up permanent employment                                │
│ • Making long-term plans to remain                              │
│ • Severing ties with home state                                 │
│                                                                 │
│ In Amelie case (Year 2):                                        │
│ • Moved to fiancé's house                                       │
│ • Applied for permanent residence visa                          │
│ • Made long-term plans to remain in State B                    │
│ • Rented out home state apartment                               │
│ → Question whether still "visiting"                             │

in State A = clearly for maintenance → Article 20 applies
(subject to other conditions)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.6 "Sources Outside That State" - CRITICAL CONDITION

```
SOURCE REQUIREMENT - EXAM CRITICAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE RULE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Article 20 ONLY applies if payments arise from sources         │
│ OUTSIDE the host state                                          │
│                                                                 │
│ • Payments from HOME state → Article 20 MAY apply              │
│ • Payments from HOST state → Article 20 CANNOT apply           │
│ • Payments from THIRD state → Article 20 MAY apply             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

June 2025 EXAM APPLICATION (Amelie):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PAYMENT (a): Maintenance grant from State A (home state)       │
│ → Arises OUTSIDE State B                                        │
│ → Article 20 CAN apply (if other conditions met)               │
│                                                                 │
│ PAYMENT (b): Research payment from State B foundation          │
│ → Arises IN State B                                             │
│ → Article 20 CANNOT apply (regardless of other conditions)     │
│ → Must consider Article 21 or Article 15 instead               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SIGNIFICANCE:
→ This is often the decisive condition
→ Even if all other conditions satisfied, host state source
  payments are NOT exempt

### 4.1 Key Commentary Paragraphs

```
IMPORTANT COMMENTARY PROVISIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COMMENTARY [2.1] - EXAM CRITICAL:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Students may derive additional payments from employment or     │
│ independent activities - this does NOT automatically deny      │
│ Article 20 treatment for other payments.                        │
│                                                                 │
│ Employment/independent income is considered SEPARATELY.        │

│ June 2025 exam application: Even if Amelie's research payment │
│ were considered employment income, Article 20 would still     │
│ apply to maintenance grant (where conditions satisfied)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

COMMENTARY [3] - SCOPE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Article 20 applies where:                                       │
│ • Person was resident in one state immediately before visiting │
│   other for study                                               │
│ • Payments are for maintenance or education                     │

### 4.2 No Time Limit in OECD Model

```
TIME LIMITS - OECD vs OTHER MODELS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OECD MODEL:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Article 20 contains NO specific time limit                      │
│                                                                 │
│ • Duration depends on "visiting" requirement                   │
│ • No maximum period specified                                   │
│ • Ends when person ceases to be "visiting"                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

US MODEL (contrast):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ US Model includes specific time limits:                         │
│ • Students: Specific year limits                                │
│ • Business trainees: Limited to one year                        │
│ (US Technical Explanation, 2006 US Model, Article 20, [293])   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

June 2025 EXAM RELEVANCE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Absence of time limit means duration question is fact-specific │
│                                                                 │
│ Question becomes: Does changed circumstance in Year 2 affect   │
│ Year 1 treatment? Generally NO - Year 1 assessed on Year 1    │
│ facts (Vogel 1997, De Broe 2022, Qing Gang K. Li)             │

## 5. INTERACTION WITH OTHER ARTICLES

### 5.1 Article 20 and Article 21 (Other Income)

```
ARTICLE 20 vs ARTICLE 21
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHEN ARTICLE 20 DOES NOT APPLY:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ If Article 20 conditions NOT satisfied, payment may fall       │
│ under Article 21 (Other Income)                                 │
│                                                                 │
│ Article 21 result: Residence state has taxing right            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

June 2025 APPLICATION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Research payment from State B:                                  │
│ → Article 20 cannot apply (source is in host state)            │
│ → If payment is for maintenance/education (not employment):    │
│   → May fall under Article 21                                   │
│   → Residence state (State A in Year 1) has taxing right       │
│                                                                 │
│ Maintenance grant if Article 20 ceases to apply (Year 2):       │
│ → May fall under Article 21                                     │
│ → Residence state (now State B) may tax                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### 5.2 Article 20 and Article 15 (Employment Income)

```
BOUNDARY BETWEEN ARTICLE 20 AND ARTICLE 15
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE ISSUE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Students often earn income from part-time work                  │
│                                                                 │
│ QUESTION: Is this Article 15 or Article 20?                     │
│                                                                 │
│ ANSWER: Depends on character of payment:                        │
│ • Payment FOR SERVICES → Article 15                             │
│ • Payment FOR MAINTENANCE → Article 20 (if other conditions)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ABUSE CONCERNS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Some taxpayers have tried to characterise employment income    │
│ as "student payments" to access Article 20 exemption           │
│                                                                 │
│ Case law example: Langroudi (US Tax Court, 2007)               │
│ → Taxpayer tried to mix up student/teacher status              │
│ → Attempted to benefit from Article 20 beyond 183 days         │
│                                                                 │
│ (Cited in June 2025 exam suggested solutions)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

June 2025 APPLICATION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Research payment analysis:                                      │
│ • If payment for services under contract → Article 15          │
│ • If payment for maintenance/education without obligations     │
│   → Could be Article 20 (but fails source test anyway)        │
│                                                                 │
│ On facts: No formal contract or deliverables                    │
│ → More likely maintenance/education than employment            │
│ → But Article 20 cannot apply as source is State B             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5.3 Article 20 and the Saving Clause

Article 20 is typically **excepted** from the saving clause (Article 1(3)):

```
SAVING CLAUSE EXCEPTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Under OECD MTC 2017, Article 20 is among the excepted provisions
from the saving clause.

EFFECT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Even if student becomes resident of host state under domestic  │
│ law, the host state cannot use the saving clause to override  │
│ the Article 20 exemption                                        │
│                                                                 │
│ This preserves the exemption for students who acquire          │
│ host state residence during their studies                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 6. UN MODEL COMPARISON

### 6.1 UN Article 20 Text

The UN Model Convention Article 20 is **similar but not identical** to the OECD:

```
UN MODEL ARTICLE 20 DIFFERENCES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OECD: "student or business APPRENTICE"
UN:   "student, apprentice or BUSINESS TRAINEE"

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ UN Model uses "business trainee" instead of "business          │
│ apprentice" and separates "apprentice"                          │
│                                                                 │
│ This may provide slightly BROADER coverage:                     │
│ • Apprentice (traditional craft/trade training)                │
│ • Business trainee (broader business training context)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

OTHER PROVISIONS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Otherwise substantially similar:                                │
│ • Same "immediately before visiting" requirement               │
│ • Same "solely for education or training" purpose              │
│ • Same "maintenance, education or training" payment types      │
│ • Same "sources outside that State" condition                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 6.2 OECD vs UN Comparison Table

| Element | OECD Model | UN Model |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Personal scope** | Student, business apprentice | Student, apprentice, business trainee |
| **Prior residence** | Immediately before visiting | Same |
| **Purpose** | Solely for education/training | Same |
| **Payments** | Maintenance, education, training | Same |
| **Source condition** | Outside host state | Same |
| **Effect** | Host state cannot tax | Same |

## 7. DOUBLE NON-TAXATION CONSEQUENCE

### 7.1 Accepted Outcome

```
DOUBLE NON-TAXATION UNDER ARTICLE 20
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Student from State A studies in State B                         │
│ Receives maintenance grant from State A                         │
│                                                                 │
│ Under Article 20:                                               │
│ → State B (host) CANNOT tax                                     │
│                                                                 │
│ Under State A domestic law:                                     │
│ → State A MAY exempt such payments                              │
│                                                                 │
│ RESULT: Neither state taxes = double non-taxation              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

IS THIS A PROBLEM?
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "It is acknowledged that Article 20 may result in double       │
│ non-taxation" (Lang, 2010)                                      │
│                                                                 │
│ This is an ACCEPTED consequence because:                        │
│ • Policy goal is to support education                           │
│ • Students typically have limited means                         │
│ • Educational benefit outweighs revenue loss                   │
│ • Maintenance grants often barely sufficient for living        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

June 2025 exam (Amelie):
State A exempts maintenance grants under domestic law
→ State B cannot tax under Article 20
→ Double non-taxation results (but this is accepted)

│ • Changed circumstances (fiancé, visa, long-term plans)        │
│ • May no longer be temporary visitor                            │
│ • If still primarily for education → Article 20 continues      │
│ • If no longer "visiting" → Article 20 may not apply           │
│   → Falls to Article 21, State B (now residence) may tax       │

### 9.2 Exam Question Types

Based on June 2025 Q4, expect questions testing:

1. **Source of payment analysis** - critical distinction
2. **"Visiting" requirement** - changed circumstances
3. **Interaction with Article 21** - when Article 20 fails
4. **"Solely for education"** - ancillary activities
5. **Retrospective effect** - Year 1 vs Year 2 treatment

### 10.2 Critical Exam Points

```
ARTICLE 20 CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. SOURCE OF PAYMENT:
   → Outside host state = Article 20 may apply
   → Inside host state = Article 20 CANNOT apply

2. PURPOSE OF PRESENCE:
   → Solely education = Article 20 may apply
   → Primarily economic = Article 20 may not apply

3. "VISITING" STATUS:
   → Temporary stay = Article 20 continues
   → Settled permanently = Article 20 may cease

4. EMPLOYMENT INCOME:
   → Service fees = Article 15 (not Article 20)
   → Maintenance grants = Article 20 (if other conditions met)

5. YEAR-BY-YEAR ANALYSIS:
   → Each year assessed on its own facts
   → Later changes generally don't affect earlier years

*Note: Article 20 is a Level 3 syllabus topic with HIGH exam relevance following the June 2025 comprehensive question (Amelie case, 25 marks). The source condition (payments from outside host state) is often decisive. Understand the "visiting" requirement and how changed circumstances may affect Article 20 application. Know Commentary [2.1] regarding separate treatment of employment income. The June 2025 exam is essential study material for this topic.*
