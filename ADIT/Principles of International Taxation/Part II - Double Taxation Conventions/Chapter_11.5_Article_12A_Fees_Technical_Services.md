# Chapter 11.5: Fees for Technical Services – Article 12A, UN MDTC

## 1. Introduction and Policy Rationale

### 1.1. The Role of Article 12A

Article 12A represents one of the most significant departures between the UN Model and the OECD Model. This article grants source countries the right to impose withholding tax on payments for technical, managerial, and consultancy services—a category of income that the OECD Model treats as business profits taxable only through the permanent establishment mechanism under Article 7.

The inclusion of Article 12A reflects the UN Model's fundamental orientation toward protecting developing country tax bases. Many developing countries are net importers of technical and professional services from developed countries, resulting in substantial outward payments that would escape source taxation entirely under OECD principles requiring permanent establishment for business profits taxation.

### 1.2. Policy Rationale for Source Taxation

The policy rationale for Article 12A centres on the inadequacy of traditional permanent establishment concepts for modern service-based economies. Technical, managerial, and consultancy services can be provided remotely across borders without any physical presence in the source country. Under OECD principles, such services would be taxable only in the residence country of the service provider, leaving the source country—where the services are utilised and economic value is derived—without any taxing rights.

Developing countries increasingly expressed concern that outbound payments for management, consulting, and technical services erode domestic tax bases. Studies indicate that approximately sixty percent of Latin American tax administrations identify service fee payments as a top base erosion concern. Article 12A addresses this by establishing source taxing rights based on where the payer is located rather than requiring physical presence of the service provider.

### 1.3. Historical Development

Although Article 12A was formally added to the UN Model in 2017, the concept of taxing technical service fees had existed in bilateral treaty practice for decades. African, Asian, and South American countries had included similar provisions in their bilateral treaties long before UN Model formalisation. The 2017 addition provided an official template that developing countries could reference in treaty negotiations.

The UN Tax Committee began discussing services taxation in 2011, taking approximately six years to reach consensus on Article 12A's formulation. This extended negotiation period reflected the fundamental philosophical differences between developed and developing country perspectives on appropriate allocation of taxing rights for cross-border service income. The eventual consensus represented a significant step in recognising the legitimate interests of source countries in taxing income generated through service activities within their territories.

## 2. Treaty Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 12A(1): Source State Taxing Right

Article 12A(1) provides that fees for technical services arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. This establishes the residence state's primary taxing right while using permissive language that does not preclude source taxation.

### 2.2. Article 12A(2): Limited Source Taxation

Article 12A(2) provides that such fees may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, according to the laws of that State. However, if the beneficial owner is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax charged shall not exceed a percentage to be established through bilateral negotiation.

Unlike Articles 10 and 11 which specify withholding rate caps, Article 12A deliberately leaves the rate blank for bilateral negotiation. This reflects the UN Model's philosophy of providing flexibility for developing countries to negotiate rates appropriate to their circumstances.

### 2.3. Article 12A(3): Definition

Article 12A(3) defines fees for technical services as any payment in consideration for any service of a managerial, technical, or consultancy nature. This definition is exhaustive—payments for services outside these three categories fall outside Article 12A's scope and are governed by other provisions, typically Article 7 for business profits.

## 3. Definition of Fees for Technical Services

### 3.1. The Three Categories

The definition encompasses three overlapping categories of services. Managerial services involve direction, control, and organisation of business operations. Technical services involve application of specialised knowledge, skill, or expertise to solve technical problems or achieve technical objectives. Consultancy services involve provision of advice and recommendations based on professional expertise.

The UN Commentary clarifies that these terms do not have precise boundaries and may overlap considerably. The common thread is that services must involve application of specialised knowledge, skill, or expertise on behalf of the client, or transfer of such knowledge to the client.

### 3.2. Specialised Knowledge Requirement

Services must involve specialised rather than routine knowledge to fall within Article 12A. Routine services that do not require specialised knowledge, skill, or expertise fall outside the article's scope. This distinction prevents Article 12A from capturing ordinary business support services that lack the technical or professional element contemplated by the provision.

The Commentary provides that technical services involve knowledge, skill, and expertise in scientific, engineering, architectural, or similar fields. Consultancy services involve advice based on specialised knowledge whether acquired through formal education or professional experience. Managerial services involve planning, organising, directing, and controlling business operations.

### 3.3. Exclusions

Article 12A excludes several categories of payments. Services ancillary to the sale of property are excluded, recognising that purchase prices often include embedded service components. Services for teaching in educational institutions are excluded. Payments by individuals for services rendered for personal use fall outside the article. Payments to employees or for professional services covered by Article 15 are similarly excluded.

The exclusion for services ancillary to sales prevents Article 12A from applying to after-sales service, warranty support, or installation assistance provided as part of equipment or technology sales. The personal use exclusion reflects the article's focus on business-to-business service payments rather than personal consumption.

## 4. Comparison with OECD Model

### 4.1. Fundamental Difference

The OECD Model contains no equivalent to Article 12A. Under OECD principles, payments for technical, managerial, and consultancy services constitute business profits governed by Article 7. Such payments are taxable in the source country only if the service provider maintains a permanent establishment there to which the income is attributable.

This fundamental difference reflects the philosophical divide between the models. The OECD Model, developed primarily by capital-exporting developed countries, favours residence-based taxation and limits source taxation to situations where the taxpayer has established significant physical presence. The UN Model, reflecting developing country concerns, expands source taxation to capture income with economic connections to the source territory regardless of physical presence.

### 4.2. Permanent Establishment Requirement

Under Article 7, source taxation requires permanent establishment—a fixed place of business through which the enterprise carries on its activities. Services performed remotely from outside the source country generate no source country taxing rights absent PE. This allows multinational service providers to earn substantial income from source country markets without source taxation.

Article 12A eliminates the PE requirement for technical service fees. The source country may tax based solely on the payer's residence—if a resident of the source country makes a payment for technical services, that country has taxing rights regardless of whether the service provider has any physical presence there. This payment-based nexus rather than presence-based nexus represents the core innovation of Article 12A.

### 4.3. Gross versus Net Taxation

Article 12A contemplates gross basis withholding—tax applied to the full payment amount without deduction for expenses incurred in providing the services. Article 7 in contrast provides for net basis taxation of profits attributable to a PE, allowing deduction of expenses properly allocable to earning the income.

Gross basis taxation offers administrative simplicity for source countries but may result in effective tax rates exceeding actual profit margins on service provision. A service provider earning ten percent margin on a contract could face withholding tax exceeding its entire profit. This concern has prompted some resistance to high Article 12A rates in treaty negotiations.

## 5. Distinction from Related Articles

### 5.1. Article 12A versus Article 12 (Royalties)

The boundary between technical services and royalties requires careful analysis. Article 12 covers payments for the right to use intellectual property—patents, copyrights, trademarks, know-how. Article 12A covers payments for performance of services applying expertise on behalf of clients.

The key distinction involves whether payment is for transfer of rights or for service performance. Know-how transfers granting the recipient the right to use technical information constitute royalties. Services applying technical knowledge to solve client problems without transferring that knowledge constitute fees for technical services.

The priority rule provides that if services involve transfer of information constituting royalties under Article 12, then Article 12 applies rather than Article 12A. This prevents overlap and ensures consistent characterisation.

### 5.2. Article 12A versus Article 7 (Business Profits)

Where Article 12A applies, it takes precedence over Article 7. Article 7(4) provides that business profits provisions do not affect application of other specific articles. Thus technical service fees falling within Article 12A are governed by that article rather than general business profits rules.

However, if the service provider has a PE in the source country and the fees are attributable to that PE, Article 7 governs. The PE exception ensures that where traditional presence-based taxation applies, the more detailed Article 7 rules on profit attribution take precedence.

### 5.3. Article 12A versus Article 14 (Independent Personal Services)

The UN Model retained Article 14 on independent personal services, which the OECD deleted in 2000. Article 14 covers professional services and other independent activities performed by individuals. Article 12A covers technical services whether performed by individuals or enterprises.

Potential overlap exists where individuals provide technical, managerial, or consultancy services. The 2025 UN Model update addressed this by replacing both Article 12A and Article 14 with the new Article 12AA, consolidating service taxation provisions.

## 6. The 2025 UN Model Update – Article 12AA

### 6.1. Replacement of Article 12A

In March 2025, the UN Tax Committee finalised a major update to the UN Model. Article 12A was removed and replaced by the new Article 12AA on services. This consolidation also absorbed former Article 14 on independent personal services, creating a single comprehensive provision for service fee taxation.

The primary motivation for this change was the difficulty taxpayers and tax authorities experienced in distinguishing between different service categories. Disputes frequently arose over whether particular payments fell under Article 7 (business profits), Article 12A (technical services), or Article 14 (independent personal services). This uncertainty created risks of both double taxation and double non-taxation.

### 6.2. Expanded Scope of Article 12AA

Article 12AA significantly expands the scope of source taxation. While Article 12A was limited to managerial, technical, and consultancy services, Article 12AA applies to fees for any service. The definition in paragraph 3 provides that fees for services means any payment in consideration for any service.

This expansion addresses the classification difficulties that plagued Article 12A but raises concerns about potential over-taxation. The extremely broad scope may face resistance from developed countries in bilateral negotiations, and the lack of specified rate leaves room for potentially high withholding.

### 6.3. Implementation Status

Article 12AA will be incorporated into the UN Model from 2025, though it is not yet backed by existing treaty practice. Given the recent adoption, no bilateral treaties have yet incorporated Article 12AA provisions. Its practical impact will depend on whether developing countries successfully negotiate its inclusion in new or amended treaties with developed country partners.

## 7. Key States' Approaches

### 7.1. India

India has been the most active user of fees for technical services provisions, incorporating FTS articles into its extensive bilateral treaty network. Indian domestic law under Section 9(1)(vii) defines FTS broadly, and India has consistently sought to protect its taxing rights over inbound technical service payments.

Indian treaties often include a "make available" clause that narrows the FTS definition. Under this formulation, services qualify as technical services only if they result in the recipient acquiring technical knowledge that can be applied independently without recourse to the service provider. This requirement distinguishes mere service performance from genuine knowledge transfer. Treaties with the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada, and Australia incorporate this "make available" requirement.

India has also successfully argued that the "make available" clause from one treaty can be imported via most-favoured-nation clauses to other treaties. This has allowed India to apply the narrower definition across its treaty network while maintaining broader domestic law protection for cases where treaties do not apply.

India increased its domestic withholding rate on FTS from ten percent to twenty percent in the Finance Act 2023, making treaty rate reductions increasingly valuable. Treaty rates typically range from ten to fifteen percent, creating significant incentive for proper treaty planning. The domestic rate increase doubled the differential between treaty and non-treaty withholding, substantially increasing the value of treaty access for service providers.

### 7.2. Other Developing Countries

African, Asian, and South American countries have included FTS provisions in bilateral treaties for decades, predating the UN Model formalisation. China, Egypt, and Malaysia have each signed over forty agreements with other developing countries incorporating technical services taxation provisions.

Regional treaty networks among developing countries consistently include source taxation rights for technical services. The 312 double taxation treaties between developing countries (South-South DTTs) typically incorporate FTS provisions, reflecting shared interest in protecting source country tax bases.

### 7.3. Developed Country Position

Developed countries generally follow the OECD Model approach, resisting inclusion of Article 12A-type provisions in their treaties. The United States does not include such provisions in its treaty network. European countries similarly prefer Article 7 treatment requiring permanent establishment for source taxation.

This resistance reflects developed countries' position as net exporters of technical services. Their residents and enterprises earn substantial income from providing services to developing country markets, and residence-based taxation preserves their primary taxing rights over this income. The philosophical divide between developed and developing country approaches to technical services taxation remains one of the most significant differences between the OECD and UN Models.

Treaty negotiations between developed and developing countries often feature difficult discussions on FTS provisions. Developed countries argue that gross basis withholding on services creates excessive taxation and discourages legitimate cross-border service provision. Developing countries counter that their tax bases suffer erosion from substantial outbound payments for imported services that escape taxation entirely under OECD principles.

## 8. Recent Developments

### 8.1. Indian Case Law (2024-2025)

Indian tribunals and courts have addressed FTS characterisation in numerous decisions. The Delhi High Court in February 2025 (Commissioner of Income Tax v. Expeditors International) held that technical services require application of specialised knowledge, with routine services falling outside Article 12A scope.

The Kolkata Tribunal in March 2024 (Metso Outotec OYJ) addressed services performed entirely outside India for an Indian affiliate. The tribunal applied the India-Finland treaty's performance-based rule, holding that services performed in Finland were not taxable in India despite benefiting the Indian entity.

### 8.2. Base Erosion Concerns

Developing countries continue to express concern about base erosion through service fee payments. The BEPS project largely focused on issues identified by developed countries, with limited attention to service fee base erosion affecting developing nations. Article 12A and now Article 12AA represent the UN's response to these concerns outside the BEPS framework.

The Subject to Tax Rule under BEPS Pillar Two provides some protection by ensuring minimum taxation of cross-border payments, but its scope is narrower than Article 12A which covers all technical services regardless of the residence country's tax rate.

### 8.3. Digital Economy Implications

The digital economy has intensified pressure on traditional PE-based taxation. Technical and consultancy services can be delivered remotely through digital platforms without any physical presence in client countries. Article 12A's payment-based nexus addresses this by granting source taxation regardless of how or where services are performed.

The relationship between Article 12A/12AA and Article 12B (Automated Digital Services) requires attention. Article 12B covers services requiring minimal human involvement—automated services delivered through technology. Article 12A/12AA covers services with significant human involvement. The distinction determines which withholding regime applies to digital service payments.

Cloud computing, software-as-a-service, and remote consulting arrangements create classification challenges. Services delivered through digital platforms may involve both automated components falling within Article 12B and human-delivered components falling within Article 12A/12AA. The allocation of payments between these categories affects withholding obligations and may require careful analysis of the service delivery model to determine proper treaty characterisation. As digital service delivery continues to expand, these characterisation questions will become increasingly significant for both taxpayers and tax administrations.
