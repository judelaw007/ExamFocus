## Chapter 10.1: Employment Income – Article 15, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 15

Article 15 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) allocates taxing rights over employment income—salaries, wages, and other similar remuneration—between Contracting States. Historically termed "dependent personal services" to distinguish it from the independent personal services covered by the now-deleted Article 14, this provision addresses income earned by employees rather than self-employed individuals.

The fundamental purpose of Article 15 is to provide certainty for cross-border workers and their employers regarding which state has the right to tax employment income. Without such rules, an employee working in multiple jurisdictions could face overlapping tax claims, creating administrative burdens and potential double taxation. Article 15 resolves this by establishing clear allocation rules based on where the employment is exercised and the residence of the employee.

#### 1.2. Fundamental Principles: Residence vs Source

Article 15 embodies two competing principles that reflect broader tensions in international tax policy. The residence principle holds that employment income should be taxable in the employee's state of residence, reflecting the personal attachment and social services provided by that state. The source principle, also called the place-of-work principle, holds that employment income should be taxable where the employment is actually exercised, reflecting the economic activity occurring in that state.

Article 15 balances these principles by establishing residence state taxation as the default rule, while permitting source state taxation when employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. This balanced approach recognises that both states have legitimate claims to tax employment income—the residence state based on personal nexus, and the source state based on where value is created through labour.

The policy tension between residence and source becomes particularly acute in cross-border employment situations. An employee who lives in one country but works in another contributes to both economies: consuming public services in the residence state while generating economic value in the source state. Article 15's allocation rules attempt to reflect this dual contribution while avoiding the complexity of income-splitting between multiple jurisdictions for every cross-border worker.

#### 1.3. Relationship with Other Treaty Articles

Article 15 operates subject to more specific provisions in Articles 16 through 19. Directors' fees (Article 16), income of entertainers and sportspersons (Article 17), pensions (Article 18), and government service income (Article 19) each have their own allocation rules that take precedence over Article 15 when applicable. This lex specialis approach ensures that income falling within these specific categories is treated under the rules designed for their particular circumstances. If employment income does not fall within Article 15 or Articles 16-19, it may be characterised as "other income" under Article 21.

### 2. The Text of Article 15

#### 2.1. Article 15(1): The General Rule

Article 15(1) of the OECD MTC 2017 provides: "Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State."

The first sentence establishes exclusive residence state taxation as the default. The word "only" grants the residence state sole taxing rights where employment is exercised entirely within that state. The second sentence introduces the source state taxing right: when employment is exercised in the other Contracting State, that state acquires a shared right to tax the remuneration derived therefrom. The phrase "may be taxed" indicates concurrent taxing rights, with double taxation relief provided under Article 23.

#### 2.2. Article 15(2): The Short-Term Exception

Article 15(2) creates an important exception to the place-of-work principle. Even when employment is exercised in another state, the remuneration remains taxable only in the residence state if three cumulative conditions are satisfied: the employee is present in the other state for no more than 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned; the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not resident in the other state; and the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other state.

This exception reflects a policy judgment that short-term assignments with limited nexus to the source state should not attract source taxation. The administrative burden of taxing brief visits would outweigh the revenue benefit, and the source state's claim to tax income from such fleeting connections is correspondingly weaker. From the employee's perspective, the exception provides welcome simplification: a worker on a brief overseas assignment need not navigate a foreign tax system, file returns in an unfamiliar jurisdiction, or face potential withholding on wages for temporary work.

#### 2.3. Article 15(3): International Transport

Article 15(3) provides a special rule for employment aboard ships or aircraft operated in international traffic: "Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic, or aboard a boat engaged in inland waterways transport, may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated."

This provision recognises the practical impossibility of determining where employment is exercised when crew members travel continuously across multiple jurisdictions. Rather than attempting to apportion income based on time spent in each state's airspace or territorial waters, Article 15(3) assigns taxing rights to the state where the operating enterprise has its place of effective management (POEM), providing a stable and identifiable connecting factor.

### 3. Application of Article 15(1)

#### 3.1. Residence State Taxation

Under the first sentence of Article 15(1), salaries, wages, and other similar remuneration are taxable "only" in the residence state when employment is not exercised in the other Contracting State. This exclusive allocation reflects the principle that residents owe their primary tax allegiance to the state providing them with governmental services, infrastructure, and social benefits.

#### 3.2. The Place-of-Work Principle

When employment is exercised in the other Contracting State, the second sentence of Article 15(1) grants that state a concurrent taxing right. Employment is considered "exercised" where the employee is physically present when performing the duties that give rise to the income. The focus is on physical presence during the actual performance of work, not on ancillary factors such as where the employment contract was signed or where the employer is located.

This physical presence test creates challenges in the modern economy. Remote working arrangements, where an employee may work from home in one state for an employer in another, require careful analysis of where employment is actually "exercised." The 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention provides guidance on cross-border home office arrangements, clarifying when such arrangements may affect treaty analysis.

#### 3.3. Scope of Employment Income

The term "salaries, wages and other similar remuneration" encompasses all forms of compensation derived from an employment relationship. The OECD Commentary confirms that this includes benefits in kind such as stock options, use of company residence or automobile, health or life insurance coverage, and club memberships. Bonuses, commissions, and performance-related payments are included. Termination payments for work performed before employment ended also fall within Article 15, with attribution depending on where employment was exercised during the relevant period. *(covered in December 2022)*

### 4. The Article 15(2) Exception

#### 4.1. Overview and Purpose

Article 15(2) provides that source state taxation does not apply if all three conditions in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) are satisfied. These conditions are cumulative—failure to meet any single condition means the source state retains its taxing right under Article 15(1). The exception reflects a balance between administrative practicality and revenue protection: short-term visitors with limited connection to the source state are exempted, while longer-term workers or those whose presence serves a local employer remain subject to source taxation. *(covered in June 2023)*

#### 4.2. Condition (a): The 183-Day Rule

The first condition requires that the employee be present in the source state for no more than 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned. Days are counted based on physical presence, with part-days counted as full days. Days need not be consecutive—all periods of presence within the twelve-month window are aggregated.

The reference to "any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned" creates a rolling test. This formulation, introduced in the 1992 update to the OECD Model, prevents manipulation through strategic timing of assignments across calendar year boundaries. The test must be applied by examining all possible twelve-month periods that either commence or end within the fiscal year in question.

#### 4.3. Condition (b): Employer Not Resident

The second condition requires that the remuneration be paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not resident in the source state. The policy rationale is that source state taxation is most justified when the employer is also resident there and claiming deductions for the remuneration against source state taxable income.

Identifying the "employer" for treaty purposes requires looking beyond formal contractual arrangements to determine the economic reality of the relationship—a concept known as the "economic employer" approach, discussed in detail in Section 5 below.

#### 4.4. Condition (c): Not Borne by Permanent Establishment

The third condition requires that the remuneration not be borne by a permanent establishment (PE) which the employer has in the source state. If the employer's PE in the source state bears the cost of the remuneration—or ought to bear it under proper transfer pricing principles—the source state has a stronger claim to tax the income, as it would typically allow a corresponding deduction.

The phrase "borne by" is interpreted broadly. It is not limited to amounts actually charged to the PE's profit and loss account. If the remuneration should properly be attributed to the PE under the arm's length principle, condition (c) fails even if no such charge has been made.

### 5. The Economic Employer Concept

#### 5.1. Substance Over Form

The formal employer identified in an employment contract may not be the same entity that substantively controls and benefits from the employee's work. In group company situations, an employee formally employed by a parent company may be seconded to work for a subsidiary in another jurisdiction. The question arises: who is the "employer" for purposes of Article 15(2)(b)?

The OECD Commentary, particularly paragraphs 8.14 to 8.26, adopts a substance over form approach. The whole context of the employment should be reviewed to determine which entity is the "economic employer"—the entity that bears the responsibility or risk for the results produced by the individual's work.

#### 5.2. OECD Commentary Guidance

Paragraph 8.14 of the Commentary provides that the formal employment relationship is not determinative. Instead, decision-makers must examine whether the putative employer has the right to exercise control over the work, bears risk and responsibility for results, and effectively integrates the employee into its business operations.

#### 5.3. Factors in Determining Economic Employer

The Commentary identifies several factors relevant to identifying the economic employer. These include: who has authority to instruct the employee regarding the manner in which work must be performed; who controls the place where work is performed; who provides tools, materials, and equipment; who determines the number and qualifications of employees; who can select the individual and terminate the assignment; who can impose disciplinary sanctions; and who determines the employee's schedule and holidays. *(covered in June 2023)*

A particularly relevant indicator is whether the formal employer directly charges the costs of the employee's services to another enterprise. Where such charging arrangements exist, it suggests that the recipient enterprise may be the economic employer. The key question remains: which entity bears the risk and responsibility for the results of the employee's work?

### 6. International Transport Workers

#### 6.1. Article 15(3) Overview

Article 15(3) provides a special rule for employment exercised aboard ships or aircraft operated in international traffic. Rather than attempting to determine where employment is exercised based on routes flown or sailed—an administratively impossible task—the provision assigns taxing rights based on the place of effective management of the operating enterprise.

The rule applies to members of the "regular complement" of the vessel or aircraft—crew members regularly employed on board rather than passengers or occasional workers. This ensures that the provision applies only to individuals whose employment genuinely involves continuous international movement.

#### 6.2. Place of Effective Management

The state in which the enterprise operating the ship or aircraft has its place of effective management may tax the remuneration. This connects crew taxation to the same state that has taxing rights over the enterprise's shipping or air transport profits under Article 8. The alignment between Articles 8 and 15(3) reflects a coherent policy approach to international transport operations.

"Place of effective management" refers to where key management and commercial decisions are made—typically the location of the board of directors or senior executives who control the day-to-day operations of the enterprise. *(covered in December 2025)*

#### 6.3. Regular Complement Requirement

The requirement that employment be as a member of the regular complement ensures Article 15(3) applies only to genuine crew members. This excludes passengers, entertainers performing on cruise ships, or other individuals temporarily aboard but not part of the vessel's operational staff. For such individuals, the general rules of Article 15(1) and (2) apply.

### 7. UN Model Considerations

#### 7.1. Current Similarities

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention Article 15 is substantially similar to the OECD Model. Both versions share the same structure, the same 183-day exception with three cumulative conditions, and the same special rule for international transport workers. The UN Commentary incorporates the OECD Commentary with modifications indicated in italics between square brackets.

#### 7.2. Proposed Article 15(4) for Remote Workers

The UN Committee of Experts has considered proposals to address remote work scenarios. Under traditional Article 15 rules, an employee resident in State A who works remotely for an employer in State B creates employment income taxable only in State A (the residence state), as employment is not "exercised" in State B through mere remote connection.

Proposed Article 15(4) would grant additional taxing rights to the employer's state of residence, even when the employee never physically works there. This would represent a significant departure from the physical presence test and reflects developing country concerns about remote work eroding their tax base. As of 2025, this proposal remains under consideration and has not been formally adopted into the UN Model.

### 8. Special Issues

#### 8.1. Stock Options and Benefits in Kind

Stock options granted in connection with employment generally fall within Article 15 as "other similar remuneration." The Commentary addresses the timing and allocation of stock option income across jurisdictions. The grant, vesting, exercise, and sale of shares may each have different tax implications, and income may need to be allocated based on where employment was exercised during the relevant period.

Upon exercise of options, the employee typically recognises employment income measured as the difference between fair market value and exercise price. Any subsequent gain from selling the acquired shares may fall within Article 13 (Capital Gains) rather than Article 15, as the individual is then acting as a shareholder rather than an employee.

#### 8.2. Termination Payments

Payments received upon termination of employment for work performed before termination fall within Article 15. The allocation of such payments between jurisdictions depends on where employment was exercised during the period to which the payment relates. Payments characterised as compensation for agreeing not to compete may require analysis under Article 15, Article 21, or potentially Article 18, depending on the nature and purpose of the payment.

#### 8.3. Cross-Border Employment Scenarios

Common cross-border employment scenarios require systematic application of Article 15 principles. For short-term assignments of less than 183 days, the analysis focuses on whether all three conditions of Article 15(2) are satisfied. For longer-term secondments, Article 15(1) applies, granting the source state concurrent taxing rights. Where employees work for multiple group companies, the economic employer analysis determines which entity is the employer for treaty purposes.

Remote working arrangements, increasingly common following the COVID-19 pandemic, require careful consideration of where employment is "exercised." The OECD's 2025 update to the Model Tax Convention provides guidance on these arrangements, addressing both permanent establishment implications and employment income allocation. Where an employee works remotely from home in one state for an employer in another, the employment is generally considered exercised where the employee is physically present—typically the employee's home state.
