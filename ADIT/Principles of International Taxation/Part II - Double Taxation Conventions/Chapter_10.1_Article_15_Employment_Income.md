# Chapter 10.1: Employment Income - Article 15

## 1. Introduction and Fundamental Principles

### 1.1. Purpose and Scope

Article 15 of the OECD Model Tax Convention allocates taxing rights over employment income between contracting states. The article addresses salaries, wages, and similar remuneration derived from employment relationships. Historically termed "dependent personal services," this category distinguishes employees from self-employed individuals. While the OECD deleted Article 14 on independent personal services from its Model in 2000, the UN Model retains this distinction.

The OECD's decision to eliminate the separate article for independent personal services reflects a fundamental shift in treaty policy. The distinction between dependent and independent services had created unnecessary complexity without serving meaningful policy objectives. Both types of personal service income involve individuals providing labor, and the tax consequences of misclassification created traps for taxpayers and administrative burdens for revenue authorities. By consolidating independent services into Article 7's business profits regime, the OECD recognized that the critical distinction is not employee versus contractor status, but rather whether a permanent establishment exists to justify source taxation. This simplification demonstrates how treaty provisions evolve to match commercial reality rather than preserve historical categorizations.

Employment income represents one of the most common forms of cross-border income in international tax practice. Globalization has resulted in increasing numbers of employees working temporarily or permanently outside their country of residence, creating situations where multiple states assert taxing rights over the same income. Article 15 provides the framework for resolving these competing claims.

### 1.2. Core Principles: Residence vs Source

Article 15 balances two competing principles in international taxation. The residence principle holds that employment income should be taxed where the employee has personal and economic attachments, aligning with ability-to-pay concepts and comprehensive worldwide taxation. The source principle maintains that income should be taxed where economic activity occurs, recognizing the source state's role in providing infrastructure and the legal framework enabling income generation.

The article implements a hierarchical structure. As a default, employment income is taxable only in the employee's residence state, reflecting the primacy of the residence principle. This exclusive right yields when employment is exercised in the other contracting state, creating concurrent taxing rights and potential double taxation relieved through Article 23.

This balance between residence and source taxation reflects decades of international consensus-building. The residence principle prevails as the default because employees typically have their strongest connections—family, home, community ties—in their state of residence, which therefore has the greatest claim to comprehensive taxation. However, pure residence taxation would permit individuals to work abroad while contributing nothing to the infrastructure and services they consume in the source state. The compromise allows source taxation when employment is actually exercised in that jurisdiction, acknowledging that physical presence and economic activity create genuine nexus. The brilliance of Article 15 lies not in favoring one principle over the other, but in establishing clear rules that tell taxpayers and tax authorities which state has priority in different circumstances.

### 1.3. Relationship with Other Articles

Article 15 operates subject to more specific provisions under the lex specialis principle. Article 16 governs directors' fees, allocating taxing rights to the company's residence state regardless of where services are performed. Article 17 addresses entertainers and sportspersons, permitting source taxation of performance income. Article 18 covers pensions paid after employment ends, while Article 19 provides special rules for government service. When income does not fall within Articles 15-19, Article 21 serves as a residual provision for "other income."

The relationship with Article 7's permanent establishment (PE) rules is particularly significant, as the presence of a PE affects the application of Article 15(2)(c).

## 2. Article 15 Text and Structure

### 2.1. Full Text

The OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 provides three paragraphs for Article 15. Paragraph 1 establishes that employment income is taxable only in the residence state unless the employment is exercised in the other state, in which case that state may also tax. Paragraph 2 creates an exception where three cumulative conditions preserve exclusive residence state taxation despite work performance in the source state: the employee's presence must not exceed 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year; the employer must not be resident in the source state; and the remuneration must not be borne by a permanent establishment in the source state. Paragraph 3 addresses ship and aircraft crew, permitting taxation in the state where the enterprise's place of effective management is situated.

### 2.2. Structural Overview

The precision of treaty language is not merely academic—it determines how billions of dollars of income will be taxed globally. When treaties use phrases like "taxable only in" versus "may be taxed in," they create fundamentally different legal regimes with profound consequences for taxpayers and governments. Ambiguous language would generate endless disputes, forcing courts in different countries to resolve identical questions with potentially divergent outcomes. The carefully calibrated terminology ensures that a taxpayer in any signatory country, and a tax administrator in any treaty partner, can read the same provision and reach the same conclusion about where tax is due. This linguistic precision is what transforms political agreements between states into operational legal frameworks that govern millions of employment relationships.

Article 15 employs precise language to allocate taxing rights. The phrase "taxable only in that State" grants exclusive taxing rights, while "may be taxed in that other State" indicates concurrent jurisdiction allowing both residence and source state taxation. Paragraph 1's first sentence creates residence state exclusivity for work performed solely in the residence state. The second sentence shifts to shared rights when employment is exercised in the source state. Paragraph 2 restores residence state exclusivity for short-term assignments meeting all three conditions. Paragraph 3 provides specialized treatment aligning employment income with enterprise profits for international transport.

## 3. Article 15(1): Basic Rules

### 3.1. Residence State Taxation

The default rule grants the residence state exclusive taxing rights when employment is not exercised in the other contracting state. This allocation reflects the residence state's comprehensive relationship with the employee, superior information about overall income and personal circumstances, and administrative efficiency. The exclusive right applies when work is performed entirely within the employee's residence state, avoiding cross-border compliance burdens for purely domestic situations.

### 3.2. Place-of-Work Principle

When employment is exercised in the other contracting state, that state may tax remuneration derived from such work. Source taxation reflects the principle that economic activity within a state's territory creates sufficient nexus to justify taxation. The source state provides infrastructure, legal protection, and the economic environment enabling work performance. The phrase "may be taxed" creates concurrent jurisdiction, with double taxation relieved through Article 23's exemption or credit methods.

### 3.3. Scope of Employment Income

The phrase "salaries, wages and other similar remuneration" receives broad interpretation. Commentary paragraph [2.1] confirms that benefits in kind are included when derived from current employment or for work done before termination. This encompasses cash compensation (salary, overtime, bonuses) and benefits in kind (housing, vehicles, insurance, club memberships, educational assistance).

Stock options present complexities addressed in Commentary paragraphs [12.2] through [12.5]. Options generally fall within Article 15 as employment income. Timing and attribution depend on when rights crystallize under domestic law and where employment was exercised during the relevant period, typically from grant to exercise or vesting. Time apportionment allocates benefits between jurisdictions based on working days in each location (ADIT December 2022).

Termination payments for work performed before termination fall within Article 15, with attribution depending on where employment was exercised. Non-compete payments raise questions about whether they constitute employment income or fall under Article 21.

### 3.4. Where Employment is Exercised

Employment is "exercised" where the employee is physically present when performing duties. This physical presence test aligns with territorial source jurisdiction concepts. The Commentary indicates employment is exercised where the employee is located when carrying out work, regardless of employer location, where benefits are realized, or where contracts were concluded.

The OECD's November 2025 update to the Model Tax Convention addressed cross-border remote work challenges. The update focused on Article 5 permanent establishment issues from home offices but has significant implications for Article 15's "employment exercised" determination, recognizing that employees increasingly work from home locations differing from employer locations or traditional offices.

## 4. Article 15(2): The 183-Day Exception

The 183-day exception represents a pragmatic recognition that not every instance of cross-border work justifies the administrative complexity of source state taxation. When employees make brief business trips or short-term assignments to another country, requiring source state tax registration, filing, and compliance creates burdens disproportionate to the tax revenue at stake. The source state must establish collection mechanisms for potentially small amounts, while employees face costs of engaging local tax advisors and navigating unfamiliar systems. The exception eliminates this friction for genuinely temporary presence, allowing businesses to send employees across borders for projects, training, or meetings without triggering dual filing obligations. However, the three-condition structure ensures that when presence becomes substantial, when the employer has local connections, or when costs are borne locally, the source state retains its taxing rights. This balance encourages cross-border business activity while preventing abuse.

### 4.1. Overview and Three Cumulative Conditions

Article 15(2) provides an exception to source taxation. Even when employment is exercised in the other state, remuneration remains taxable only in the residence state if all three conditions are satisfied. The cumulative nature requires that failure of any single condition restores source state taxing rights under Article 15(1). The exception reflects administrative simplicity for short-term assignments where the employee's source state connection is temporary and the employer lacks sufficient presence to justify source taxation.

### 4.2. Condition (a): 183-Day Presence Test

The first condition requires that employee presence in the source state not exceed 183 days in aggregate during any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned. This creates a rolling test examining all consecutive twelve-month spans. The phrase "any twelve month period" means calculation is not limited to calendar or fiscal years (ADIT June 2023).

Commentary paragraph [5] establishes that part of a day counts as a full day. An employee present for any portion of a day, regardless of hours, consumes one day of the 183-day allowance. This includes arrival and departure days, transit days, and day trips. The strict approach prevents manipulation and ensures consistent application.

The seemingly harsh "part of a day" rule serves critical anti-avoidance objectives. Without this bright-line standard, taxpayers could argue that arrival at 11:00 PM should count as zero days, or that a four-hour meeting shouldn't count the same as a full working day. Tax authorities would face impossible verification challenges determining how many hours an employee actually worked each day, requiring detailed time tracking and creating endless disputes. The rule also prevents gaming: employees could schedule arrivals for late evening and departures for early morning, potentially doubling their effective presence while claiming minimal day counts. By treating any presence as a full day, the provision creates certainty and administrability at the cost of some rough justice in edge cases. This trade-off reflects the treaty drafters' judgment that predictable outcomes matter more than perfect precision.

Days need not be consecutive; all periods aggregate. An employee making trips of 50, 60, and 30 days accumulates 140 days, below the threshold. Careful tracking of all presence is required.

### 4.3. Condition (b): Employer Not Resident

The second condition requires that remuneration be paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not resident of the source state. Commentary paragraph [6.2] explains the policy: taxing rights should go to the state recognizing the remuneration cost as a deduction from taxable profits. If a source-state resident employer pays remuneration and deducts the expense, the source state should have corresponding taxing rights.

The critical question is identifying "the employer" for treaty purposes. Commentary paragraph [8.14] introduces the "economic employer" concept, recognizing that formal employment contracts may not reflect economic reality in multinational groups. The Commentary directs attention to "the whole context of the employment" to determine which entity should be considered the economic employer, focusing on which entity bears responsibility or risk for results produced by the individual's work.

### 4.4. Condition (c): Not Borne by Permanent Establishment

The third condition requires that remuneration not be borne by a permanent establishment the employer has in the source state. The phrase "borne by" requires economic analysis beyond accounting charges. The Commentary indicates that if remuneration ought to be economically attributed to a permanent establishment based on functions performed and benefits received, the condition fails even without actual charging. This substance-over-form approach prevents manipulation through artificial allocations.

If the employer has no permanent establishment in the source state, this condition is automatically satisfied. When a permanent establishment exists, analysis must determine whether employee services relate to the permanent establishment's activities such that remuneration should be attributed under Article 7's profit attribution principles.

The cumulative nature of Article 15(2)'s three conditions reflects sophisticated policy design. Each condition addresses a different dimension of the employment relationship's connection to the source state. Condition (a) measures the employee's physical presence and personal connection. Condition (b) examines whether the employer has sufficient nexus with the source state to justify taxation there. Condition (c) determines whether the economic burden of remuneration falls on source-state activities. All three must align to justify residence-state-only taxation. This structure prevents scenarios where, for example, an employee spends only 100 days in the source state but works for a local subsidiary that bears the costs—a situation where source taxation is clearly appropriate despite limited employee presence. The architecture ensures that the short-term exception applies only when the employment relationship is genuinely transitory and lacks substantial source-state connections.

## 5. The Economic Employer Concept

### 5.1. Background and OECD 2010 Report

The economic employer concept emerged from difficulties applying Article 15(2)(b) to modern cross-border employment. In multinational groups, formal employment contracts often remain with a home-country entity while employees are seconded to foreign affiliates. The legal employer administers payroll, but the employee's supervision and functional integration occurs with the host entity.

The rise of multinational enterprises exposed a critical vulnerability in Article 15(2)'s structure. Sophisticated taxpayers could satisfy the treaty's literal requirements while defeating its policy objectives. Consider an employee seconded from a UK parent company to work full-time at a US subsidiary for 150 days. The formal employment contract remains with the UK entity, which continues paying salary and receiving reimbursement from the US subsidiary. Under a purely legalistic reading, conditions (a) and (b) appear satisfied, suggesting US taxation should not apply. Yet the employee works entirely for the US operation, supervised by US managers, furthering US business objectives, with costs economically borne by the US entity. Permitting such arrangements to escape source taxation would create systematic base erosion. The economic employer concept emerged to address this gap, requiring analysis of which entity truly bears the employment relationship's economic substance rather than accepting formal legal arrangements at face value.

The OECD's 2010 update to the Model Tax Convention, approved by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010, comprehensively analyzed cross-border employment arrangements, concluding that substance-over-form analysis was necessary to identify which entity bore the real economic relationship with the employee. The update's recommendations were incorporated into the OECD Commentary on Article 15 addressing employment income taxation.

### 5.2. Commentary Guidance

Commentary paragraph [8.14] provides the economic employer framework, stating that "the whole context of the employment should be reviewed to determine which entity is the 'economic employer' of the individual." This requires comprehensive factual analysis rather than mechanical application.

The Commentary identifies relevant factors: which entity has authority to instruct the employee on work performance; which entity controls or bears responsibility for the work place; which entity provides tools and materials; which entity determines worker numbers and qualifications; which entity selects individuals and can terminate employment; which entity can impose disciplinary sanctions; and which entity determines schedules and holidays. No single factor is determinative.

### 5.3. Control Factors and Risk Analysis

The central question focuses on which entity bears entrepreneurial risk from the employee's work. If the employee's activities are integral to a host entity's business, if that entity bears success/failure risk, and if it would suffer consequences from employee errors, these factors suggest the host entity functions as the economic employer despite formal contracts.

Commentary paragraph [8.15] addresses charging arrangements, noting that direct charging by the formal employer to another enterprise for the individual's services is relevant though not conclusive. Charging with markup suggests the host entity may be the economic employer. Conversely, when no charging exists and the formal employer bears economic costs, this supports treating the formal employer as the economic employer.

### 5.4. Case Law and Practical Application

The economic employer concept found early application in Netherlands case law. The Hoge Raad's July 11, 2008 decision (BNB 2008/234) held that an entity controlling employee work and bearing economic risk should be treated as the employer for treaty purposes regardless of formal contracts. These decisions influenced the OECD's 2010 report and Commentary revisions. German courts similarly applied economic substance analysis (ADIT June 2023).

Practical application requires gathering evidence about actual working relationships: organizational charts showing reporting lines, correspondence revealing work assignment and instructions, training records, performance evaluations, and financial records demonstrating which entity's budget bears costs and whether recharges occur.

## 6. Article 15(3): International Transport Workers

### 6.1. The Rule and Rationale

Article 15(3) provides specialized treatment for employment exercised aboard ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and boats in inland waterways transport. Paragraph 3 permits taxation in the state where the enterprise's place of effective management (POEM) is situated, aligning employment income taxation with Article 8's treatment of enterprise profits.

Ship and aircraft crew work across multiple jurisdictions, making standard place-of-work principle administratively impractical. A pilot flying routes between five countries might exercise employment in all jurisdictions within a week. The POEM provides a stable connecting factor, typically where the enterprise maintains headquarters and makes operational decisions (ADIT December 2025).

The special rule for international transport workers illustrates how treaty provisions must adapt to industry realities. Applying Article 15(1)'s place-of-work principle to crew members would create absurd outcomes. A flight attendant working Tokyo-London-New York routes would owe taxes in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus their residence state. Each jurisdiction would demand filing and compliance for a tiny fraction of annual income. The administrative burden would be crushing, both for employees and tax authorities attempting to verify and collect small amounts. Moreover, aircraft and ships operate in international airspace and waters where no state has jurisdiction. The solution aligns crew taxation with enterprise profits taxation, recognizing that crew are integral to transport operations and should be taxed where the enterprise is managed, creating a single, administrable connecting factor that reflects economic reality.

### 6.2. Scope and Application

Article 15(3) applies only to employment exercised aboard the ship or aircraft. The term "aboard" requires physical presence on the vessel or aircraft during duty performance. Shore-based employees of shipping or airline companies fall under general Article 15(1) and (2) rules. The phrase "regular complement" indicates the provision addresses crew members regularly employed on vessels or aircraft.

The requirement that ships or aircraft be "operated in international traffic" imports the definition from Article 3(1). International traffic means transport by ships or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a contracting state, except where operated solely between places in the other state. This excludes purely domestic operations while encompassing regularly scheduled international routes and international charter operations.

## 7. UN Model and Contemporary Developments

### 7.1. UN Model Article 15

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention maintains an Article 15 closely paralleling the OECD Model's structure. The UN Model shows minimal divergence from the OECD approach in employment income provisions, unlike other articles where the UN Model significantly differs to favor source state taxation. Both models employ the same three-condition test for the 183-day exception and identical language for ship and aircraft crew treatment.

The UN Commentary emphasizes source state taxation rights and developing country perspectives more than the OECD Commentary, but substantive rules remain largely aligned between the two models.

### 7.2. Proposed Article 15(4): Remote Workers

Remote work fundamentally challenges Article 15's foundational premise that employment is exercised where the employee is physically located. The traditional framework assumed employees would either work at an employer's premises or travel to customer locations, creating clear geographic nexus. Remote work severs this connection. An employee can live in a low-tax jurisdiction while serving customers, managing operations, or providing services exclusively for an enterprise located in a high-tax jurisdiction without ever setting foot there. The employer's state receives no tax revenue despite the employee's work generating value within its economy and the employer deducting labor costs from its taxable profits. This creates what developing countries view as an inequitable allocation, particularly when high-skilled workers in low-tax states provide services to employers in source states that lose both the employment income tax base and potentially permanent establishment profits if remote work prevents PE creation.

The UN Committee of Experts has considered a proposed new paragraph addressing remote workers. The proposal would permit the employer's residence state to tax employment income even when the employee never physically worked there. Under current Article 15, when an employee resident in State A works remotely for an employer resident in State B without traveling to State B, only State A can tax because employment is exercised entirely in State A.

Proposed Article 15(4) would authorize the employer's residence state to exercise additional taxing rights when remuneration is deductible in determining the employer's taxable profits. This reflects developing country concerns about losing tax base when remote work allows employees to provide services from low-tax jurisdictions to employers in higher-tax jurisdictions. The provision remains under discussion as of 2025.

### 7.3. Digital Nomads and Modern Workplace

Remote work has created new challenges for Article 15's framework. An estimated 40 million digital nomads worldwide in 2025 engage in location-independent work, frequently moving between countries while maintaining employment with entities in other countries. These individuals often have weak connections to any single residence state and may avoid establishing tax residence in high-tax jurisdictions.

Many countries have introduced digital nomad visa programs offering special residence and tax treatment. Portugal, Spain, Croatia, Caribbean states, and Dubai have established such programs, typically offering one- to two-year visas with beneficial tax regimes. These programs create potential conflicts with treaty Article 15 allocations.

The Multilateral Instrument (MLI), which entered into force on July 1, 2018, and has been adopted by over 100 jurisdictions to modify almost 2,000 bilateral tax treaties, did not address Article 15 or remote work issues, focusing instead on anti-abuse provisions under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Actions 6 and 7 and dispute resolution under Action 14.

## 8. Special Issues

### 8.1. Stock Options

The critical question for cross-border stock option allocation concerns where employment was exercised during the period to which the stock option relates. If an employee works in State A for three years while options vest, then transfers to State B for two years before exercising, the benefit would be allocated 60 percent to State A and 40 percent to State B based on working days during the five-year period. This temporal apportionment requires detailed tracking of work location throughout the grant-to-exercise period.

### 8.2. Termination Payments

Payments upon employment termination require characterization. Commentary paragraph [2.1] indicates that amounts derived "after the termination of employment, for work done before the employment was terminated" generally constitute employment income subject to Article 15. Severance payments compensating for years of service, accrued vacation pay, and similar amounts fall within the article's scope. Attribution depends on where employment was exercised during the period to which termination payments relate.

Non-compete payments present difficult issues. When employees receive payment for agreeing not to compete after employment ends, the payment might be viewed either as deferred compensation for prior employment (Article 15) or as payment for a post-employment covenant (potentially Article 21). Different jurisdictions have reached different conclusions on this characterization.

The characterization of termination and non-compete payments reveals fundamental tensions in treaty interpretation. Article 15 was drafted for traditional employment relationships where compensation arrives during employment for contemporaneous work. Modern executive compensation includes elaborate post-employment arrangements: multi-year non-compete agreements, deferred compensation vesting after departure, and golden parachute severance packages. These structures blur the line between employment compensation and post-employment payments. The stakes are substantial: if characterized as employment income, the payment is sourced based on where historical work occurred, potentially creating taxing rights in states where the individual no longer resides or works. If characterized as "other income" under Article 21, exclusive residence state taxation typically applies. The lack of international consensus on these characterizations creates planning opportunities for taxpayers and headaches for tax authorities, with outcomes often depending on which country's courts ultimately interpret ambiguous provisions.

### 8.3. Cross-Border Remote Work

The OECD's November 2025 update to the Model Tax Convention addressed cross-border remote work primarily through Article 5 permanent establishment modifications rather than amending Article 15's text. The update added Commentary addressing when a home office creates a fixed place of business permanent establishment. The guidance distinguishes between short-term, lifestyle-driven remote work (typically not creating a PE) and long-term arrangements where employees work from another country to serve that market (potentially creating a PE).

These PE determinations have direct implications for Article 15(2)(c). If an employee's home office constitutes a permanent establishment of the employer in the employee's residence state, and remuneration is borne by that permanent establishment, Article 15(2)'s exception becomes unavailable even if employee presence and employer non-residence would otherwise satisfy conditions (a) and (b). Companies with significant remote worker populations must assess not only employees' physical presence but also whether work arrangements create permanent establishments triggering condition (c) and subjecting employment income to source state taxation.

The interconnection between Article 5 PE determinations and Article 15 employment income taxation demonstrates the integrated nature of treaty provisions. Before widespread remote work, these articles operated largely independently: Article 5 governed whether business profits could be taxed, while Article 15 handled employee taxation. Remote work creates convergence. When employees work from home offices, their residences potentially become fixed places of business for PE purposes, while simultaneously being the location where employment is exercised for Article 15 purposes. This dual characterization creates compounding tax exposure—the home state may assert both PE-based business profits taxation and employment income taxation. For multinational employers, the stakes extend beyond individual employees to systemic questions about where global workforce arrangements create taxable presence. A company with hundreds of remote workers across dozens of countries faces potential PE exposure in each jurisdiction, transforming Article 15(2)(c) from an occasional compliance consideration into a central strategic concern requiring comprehensive workforce location tracking and treaty analysis.
