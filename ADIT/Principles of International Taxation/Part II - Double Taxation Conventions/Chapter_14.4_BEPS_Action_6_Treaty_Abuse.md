# Chapter 14.4: BEPS Action 6 – Treaty Abuse

## 1. Introduction and Action 6 Framework

### 1.1. The Action 6 Final Report

BEPS Action 6 addressed treaty abuse as one of the most significant concerns within the broader base erosion and profit shifting project. The October 2015 Final Report established a mandatory minimum standard requiring all Inclusive Framework members to implement measures preventing treaty shopping and other forms of treaty abuse. Treaty shopping—where residents of third countries access treaty benefits by routing transactions through entities in treaty partner jurisdictions—represented one of the primary concerns driving the project.

The Action 6 recommendations fundamentally altered the international treaty framework by introducing explicit anti-abuse provisions into the OECD Model. Before 2015, treaties generally lacked comprehensive mechanisms to deny benefits in abuse situations, relying instead on domestic anti-avoidance rules of varying scope and effectiveness. The minimum standard created internationally coordinated requirements ensuring consistent protection across the treaty network.

### 1.2. Relationship to Broader Anti-Abuse Framework

Action 6 complements other BEPS measures addressing treaty abuse. Action 2 targets hybrid mismatch arrangements exploiting differences in entity characterisation. Action 7 addresses artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status. Actions 8-10 align transfer pricing outcomes with value creation. Together, these actions create a comprehensive framework preventing base erosion through treaty exploitation, with Action 6 specifically addressing threshold questions of treaty entitlement.

## 2. Minimum Standard Components

### 2.1. Three Core Requirements

The Action 6 minimum standard comprises three essential components working together to prevent treaty abuse. First, treaties must contain clear preamble statements that their purpose includes eliminating double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. This clarifies interpretive context for all substantive provisions.

Second, treaties must include specific anti-abuse provisions—either the Principal Purpose Test, Limitation on Benefits provisions, or a combination of both. This operational requirement ensures mechanisms exist for denying benefits in abuse situations. Third, the BEPS Inclusive Framework coordinates implementation through structured peer review, ensuring consistent application with meaningful consequences for non-compliance (covered in December 2024).

### 2.2. Three Implementation Options

Jurisdictions satisfy the minimum standard through one of three approaches. The first option—Principal Purpose Test alone—has been adopted by the overwhelming majority, with over ninety-nine MLI signatories choosing this approach. The PPT provides flexibility through standards-based analysis adaptable to novel abuse schemes without requiring treaty renegotiation.

The second option combines simplified LOB provisions with the Principal Purpose Test. This hybrid approach provides categorical certainty through LOB while maintaining PPT as a backstop against sophisticated arrangements satisfying LOB literally while contradicting treaty purposes. Few jurisdictions have adopted this combination.

The third option employs detailed Limitation on Benefits provisions without PPT. This approach, essentially unique to United States treaty practice, relies on comprehensive objective tests anticipating all potential abuse scenarios. The detailed rules provide maximum legal certainty but require extensive drafting and may miss novel arrangements unanticipated when treaties were negotiated.

### 2.3. Preamble Language Requirements

The minimum standard requires revised preamble language clarifying that treaties are intended to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including through treaty-shopping arrangements. This language—implemented through MLI Article 6—serves multiple functions within the interpretive framework.

Under Vienna Convention principles, the preamble forms part of the treaty's context guiding interpretation of all substantive provisions. The explicit anti-abuse statement provides authoritative guidance that treaties are not intended to facilitate abuse. It supports denying benefits in borderline cases where specific provisions are ambiguous and provides context for competent authority decisions on discretionary relief. The language represents a significant shift from pre-BEPS preambles, which typically referenced only double taxation elimination without addressing abuse prevention.

## 3. Principal Purpose Test Structure

### 3.1. The Reasonable to Conclude Standard

The Principal Purpose Test, articulated in Article 29(9) of the OECD Model and implemented through MLI Article 7, provides that a treaty benefit shall not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction, unless granting the benefit would accord with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty provisions.

The reasonableness standard establishes an objective test based on what a reasonable observer would conclude from available evidence. It is neither a purely subjective inquiry into actual taxpayer intent nor a mechanical test applied without regard to context. Tax authorities must examine relevant factors including the timing of arrangements, commercial rationale advanced by taxpayers, substance of entities involved, and whether alternative structures with different tax consequences were available.

The burden of demonstrating that PPT applies rests initially with tax authorities. This allocation was confirmed in the SC Lowy case, where Indian courts held that authorities cannot presume abuse from structural arrangements alone but must provide cogent evidence supporting PPT application. Structural features such as holding company incorporation or investment routing through treaty jurisdictions do not automatically trigger PPT denial (covered in June 2024).

### 3.2. Principal Purpose Threshold

The PPT applies where obtaining treaty benefits was one of the principal purposes of the arrangement—not necessarily the sole or dominant purpose. Multiple purposes may coexist, and a transaction may have genuine commercial substance while still having treaty benefit acquisition as a principal purpose. This relatively low threshold ensures that anti-abuse protection applies broadly to arrangements where tax considerations significantly influenced structure.

The test applies to any arrangement or transaction, covering discrete transactions, ongoing structures, and series of related steps. This broad scope prevents fragmentation of abusive arrangements into components that individually appear innocent. The Commentary provides guidance on evaluating purpose, emphasising that contemporaneous documentation of commercial rationale carries significant weight while acknowledging that documents alone cannot conclusively establish or disprove tax-motivated purpose.

### 3.3. Object and Purpose Exception

The saving clause provides that even where obtaining treaty benefits was a principal purpose, benefits must still be granted if granting them accords with the relevant treaty provisions' object and purpose. This exception protects legitimate arrangements from mechanical denial and requires inquiry into whether the claimed benefits are consistent with what the treaty intends to provide.

The object and purpose exception proves particularly important for holding company structures. An entity incorporated partly for tax efficiency but genuinely managing investments and adding value may access reduced withholding rates if such reduction accords with the dividend article's purpose of facilitating cross-border investment. Similarly, structures implementing legitimate commercial reasons—regulatory compliance, risk isolation, commercial necessity—may survive PPT scrutiny through the exception.

The burden shifts to taxpayers to demonstrate consistency with object and purpose once authorities establish principal purpose concerns. The OECD Commentary provides illustrative examples including regulatory-driven structures and commercially necessary arrangements. The exception acknowledges that tax efficiency is a legitimate consideration in business structuring and that treaties intend to provide benefits to genuine arrangements even where tax considerations influenced their form.

## 4. LOB Technical Elements

### 4.1. Qualified Person Categories

Limitation on Benefits provisions establish objective categorical tests determining treaty entitlement. Individuals resident in a contracting state qualify automatically, as do governments, political subdivisions, and public entities. Publicly traded companies with shares regularly traded on recognised stock exchanges qualify because dispersed ownership effectively eliminates treaty shopping concerns—no single third-country owner can exploit the entity's treaty access.

Pension funds providing retirement benefits to residents qualify given their social purpose and regulated nature. Non-profit organisations devoted to religious, charitable, educational, or scientific purposes similarly qualify. These categorical qualifications reflect assessments that certain entity types pose minimal treaty shopping risk due to their nature, regulation, or ownership characteristics.

Other entities must satisfy both ownership and base erosion tests. The ownership test typically requires that more than fifty percent of the entity be held by persons who are themselves qualified persons. The base erosion test requires that less than fifty percent of the entity's gross income be paid or accrued as deductible expenses to persons who are not residents of either contracting state. Together, these tests ensure that entities claiming treaty benefits have genuine connections to the residence state and do not function primarily as conduits for non-qualifying persons.

### 4.2. Active Business Test

Entities failing qualified person categorical tests may still access treaty benefits through the active trade or business test. This requires substantial business activities in the residence state, with income derived in connection with or incidental to that business. Critically, the source-state activity generating the income must be substantial in relation to the residence-state business—a proportionality requirement preventing token operations from justifying major source-state benefits.

The active business test recognises that genuine operating businesses should access treaty benefits even where ownership structures might otherwise disqualify them. A manufacturing company with substantial residence-state operations should access reduced withholding on source-state royalties related to its core business, regardless of whether its ultimate shareholders satisfy qualified person tests. The test focuses on business substance rather than ownership characteristics (covered in December 2023).

### 4.3. Derivative Benefits and Discretionary Relief

Derivative benefits provisions recognise that treaty shopping concerns diminish when ultimate owners would themselves be entitled to equivalent or better treaty benefits. Where seventy-five percent or more of an entity's shares are held by equivalent beneficiaries—persons who would receive equal or better treatment under treaties between their residence states and the source state—the entity may access treaty benefits. This acknowledges that structural efficiency, rather than treaty shopping, may motivate such arrangements.

Discretionary competent authority relief provides a safety valve ensuring legitimate arrangements are not denied benefits due to technical failures under objective tests. Competent authorities may grant benefits to persons demonstrating genuine connections to the residence state despite failing categorical qualifications. This preserves authority to deny benefits in abusive situations while allowing case-by-case consideration of unusual circumstances. The discretionary nature prevents taxpayers from claiming relief as of right while ensuring genuinely connected persons can access treaty protection.

## 5. MLI Implementation

### 5.1. Articles 6 and 7

The Multilateral Instrument implements Action 6 recommendations through Articles 6 and 7. Article 6 requires all Covered Tax Agreements to include revised preamble language stating that the treaty's purpose includes eliminating double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. This language applies automatically to all CTAs regardless of which anti-abuse option parties chose.

Article 7 establishes the Principal Purpose Test as the default mechanism for meeting the minimum standard. Signatories may choose to apply PPT alone, PPT with simplified LOB, or detailed LOB provisions. However, given that ninety-nine or more signatories chose PPT alone, Article 7 effectively establishes PPT as the global default anti-abuse mechanism. The convergence on this standards-based approach represents significant harmonisation across diverse legal traditions.

### 5.2. The Overlay Mechanism

The MLI operates through a distinctive overlay mechanism rather than directly amending bilateral treaty text. It functions as a separate treaty applying alongside existing agreements, modifying their effect without changing their written provisions. This approach enables coordinated modification of approximately two thousand treaties without requiring individual bilateral renegotiations.

The overlay mechanism operates through Vienna Convention Article 30(3), which provides that where treaties relate to the same subject matter, the later treaty prevails to the extent of inconsistency. Practitioners must examine synthesised texts combining original treaty provisions with applicable MLI modifications. The OECD provides an online matching database for determining MLI application to specific treaty relationships based on each party's notifications and reservations.

Treaties become Covered Tax Agreements only if both parties designate them as such. This mutual designation requirement ensures that bilateral relationships cannot be unilaterally modified—both parties must agree to MLI application. The result is that MLI impact varies across different treaty relationships depending on each party's notifications, reservations, and choices among alternative provisions.

### 5.3. Optional Provisions Beyond Minimum Standard

Beyond the minimum standard, MLI Part III includes optional anti-abuse provisions that signatories may adopt. Article 8 addresses dividend transfer transactions, denying reduced withholding rates where shares were acquired primarily to obtain treaty benefits. This targets arrangements involving share transfers timed to access treaty benefits not available to prior shareholders.

Article 9 enables source taxation of capital gains from shares deriving value principally from immovable property at any point during the 365 days preceding alienation. This prevents avoidance through temporary reduction of property holdings before disposal. Articles 10 and 11 address anti-abuse rules for permanent establishments in third jurisdictions and saving clauses preserving states' rights to tax their own residents respectively.

## 6. Peer Review Process

### 6.1. Methodology and Findings

The BEPS minimum standard is monitored through structured peer review ensuring consistent implementation with real consequences for non-compliance. The Sixth Peer Review Report on Treaty Shopping, published November 2025, confirmed that over 1,120 agreements between Inclusive Framework members now comply with the minimum anti-abuse standard. This represents a thirty percent increase in compliant agreements between 2022 and 2023 alone.

Approximately 630 additional agreements will become compliant once all signatories complete ratification procedures. The peer review covered 142 jurisdictions, with twelve receiving recommendations to complete steps for MLI entry into force and four receiving recommendations to develop implementation plans. The methodology shifted in 2024 to comprehensive reviews every five years rather than annual assessments, reflecting stable implementation trajectories across most jurisdictions.

### 6.2. Implementation Challenges

The peer review process has identified ongoing interpretive development regarding the relationship between PPT and LOB provisions where both apply. Questions remain whether LOB satisfaction creates a presumption of treaty entitlement or whether PPT can independently deny benefits to persons satisfying all LOB requirements. The Commentary suggests that LOB provisions reflect treaty object and purpose, implying that LOB satisfaction should generally establish entitlement, but sophisticated abuse satisfying LOB literally while contradicting purposes may remain subject to PPT denial.

Regional variations in implementation reflect different policy priorities. Developing countries have been less likely to adopt arbitration provisions, with only approximately twenty-seven jurisdictions accepting mandatory binding arbitration under MLI Part VI. Capital-importing countries have been significantly more likely to adopt expanded permanent establishment provisions, while capital-exporting countries have shown less enthusiasm for measures expanding source-state taxing rights.

## 7. Emerging Case Law

### 7.1. Burden and Evidence Standards

Early case law applying the PPT has focused on burden allocation and evidentiary standards. The SC Lowy decision established that Indian tax authorities bear the burden of demonstrating PPT application and cannot presume abuse from structural arrangements alone. This reflects the reasonable observer standard in the PPT text—authorities must provide cogent evidence that a reasonable person would conclude treaty benefit acquisition was a principal purpose.

The Tiger Global case emphasised the importance of commercial substance in PPT analysis. Courts require balanced evaluation of beneficial ownership and commercial rationale rather than focusing solely on structural features. Tax residency certificates remain important for establishing tax residence, but substantive beneficial ownership—genuine control over and entitlement to income—matters for PPT purposes rather than mere legal title.

### 7.2. Prospective Application

India's CBDT Circular 1/2025 established that the PPT applies prospectively from treaty effective dates, with shares acquired before April 2017 grandfathered from PPT scrutiny. This guidance addresses the interaction between treaty-based anti-abuse provisions and domestic GAAR, suggesting that earlier domestic anti-avoidance principles may apply to arrangements predating PPT introduction while PPT governs subsequent transactions (covered in June 2023).

The prospective application approach provides transitional certainty for pre-existing investments while ensuring new arrangements comply with current anti-abuse standards. Other jurisdictions have similarly adopted prospective approaches, recognising that retroactive application of new anti-abuse provisions would create uncertainty and potentially violate legitimate expectations based on treaty language at the time investments were made.

## 8. Recent Developments

### 8.1. 2025 OECD Model Update

The November 2025 update to the OECD Model maintained existing Article 29 anti-abuse provisions while introducing guidance on emerging issues. The remote working guidance in Article 5 Commentary addresses post-pandemic work patterns, clarifying that employees working from home in another country do not automatically create permanent establishments for employers. The natural resources provision enlarges source-state taxing rights through lower PE thresholds for extraction activities—reflecting developing country priorities within the broader anti-abuse framework.

### 8.2. Institutional Developments

The withdrawal of the United States from the OECD Inclusive Framework in January 2025 introduced uncertainty regarding future multilateral anti-abuse developments. While the US maintains its traditional LOB approach in bilateral treaties, its departure from Inclusive Framework processes may affect coordination on anti-abuse interpretation and implementation. The US-Chile treaty concluded in 2024 confirmed continued US adherence to detailed LOB provisions rather than PPT adoption.

The UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, initiated through General Assembly Resolution 79/235 in December 2024, may provide an alternative multilateral forum for anti-abuse developments. The convention envisions comprehensive approaches to international taxation more responsive to developing country interests, potentially including enhanced source taxation provisions and alternative anti-abuse mechanisms. Whether this initiative produces binding standards complementing or competing with OECD work remains to be seen as negotiations progress through 2027.
