# Chapter 7.3: BEPS Action 7 – Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment

## 1. The Policy Context

### 1.1. The Problem Identified

The permanent establishment concept operates as the threshold for source State taxation of business profits under Article 7. An enterprise resident in one Contracting State is taxable in the other State only if it carries on business through a permanent establishment situated there. This threshold creates a powerful incentive: enterprises that can conduct substantial economic activity in a country without triggering permanent establishment status avoid source State taxation entirely.

The BEPS Project identified that multinational enterprises had developed sophisticated strategies to avoid permanent establishment status artificially. These strategies exploited technical features of the permanent establishment definition to disconnect the location of economic activity from the location of taxation. The result was that enterprises could make substantial sales in a country, employ local personnel, and maintain significant physical presence while remaining outside that country's taxing jurisdiction.

### 1.2. The Action 7 Mandate

The BEPS Action Plan of 2013 defined Action 7 as developing changes to the permanent establishment definition to prevent artificial avoidance, specifically addressing commissionaire arrangements and specific activity exemptions. The mandate was deliberately narrow, focusing on strategies that lacked genuine commercial substance rather than expanding permanent establishment definitions generally.

The distinction between artificial avoidance and legitimate tax planning was central to Action 7's approach. The concern was not that enterprises minimised taxes through efficient structures, but that certain arrangements existed primarily for tax reasons while lacking commercial justification beyond tax savings.

## 2. Targeted Avoidance Strategies

### 2.1. Commissionaire Arrangements

A commissionaire is a civil law concept where an agent sells goods or services in their own name but on behalf of a principal. The commissionaire concludes contracts with customers, taking legal title briefly before transferring it to the customer, while the principal retains beneficial ownership of goods until sale. The commissionaire earns a commission; the principal receives the sale proceeds.

Under pre-2017 Article 5(5), an agency permanent establishment existed only where the agent concluded contracts "in the name of" the enterprise. Because commissionaires concluded contracts in their own names—binding themselves rather than the principal—no permanent establishment arose for the principal. The economic substance of the arrangement was equivalent to a subsidiary distributor, but the tax consequences differed dramatically.

Two landmark cases confirmed this interpretation. In Zimmer (France, 2010), the Conseil d'État held that a French commissionaire distributing products for a UK principal did not create a permanent establishment because the commissionaire could not legally bind the principal. In Dell (Norway, 2011), the Norwegian Supreme Court reached the same conclusion, finding that Dell Products (Ireland) had no permanent establishment through Dell AS (Norway) operating as its commissionaire.

These decisions were technically correct under existing treaty language but highlighted a policy gap. The Spanish Supreme Court took a different approach in Dell (Spain, 2016), finding that a permanent establishment existed even under the pre-2017 language, interpreting "on behalf of" to include economic rather than purely legal representation. This divergence among jurisdictions demonstrated the uncertainty surrounding commissionaire treatment.

### 2.2. Exploitation of Specific Activity Exemptions

Article 5(4) provided exemptions for activities deemed preparatory or auxiliary in character. The listed activities—storage, display, delivery of goods, maintenance of stock, purchasing, and information collection—were automatically exempt under the pre-2017 formulation without requiring analysis of whether they were genuinely preparatory or auxiliary to the enterprise's core business.

This automatic exemption created opportunities for fragmentation. An enterprise could divide its operations into multiple facilities, each claiming a separate exemption: a warehouse for "storage," another for "delivery," an office for "information collection." While each facility might satisfy the literal requirements for exemption, the combined operation represented a core business function rather than preparatory or auxiliary activity.

The problem was particularly acute in e-commerce. Large fulfilment centres processing thousands of orders daily were characterised as mere "delivery" facilities, escaping permanent establishment status despite performing core distribution functions. The disconnect between the technical characterisation and economic reality undermined source State taxation of substantial business operations.

### 2.3. Contract Splitting

Article 5(3) provides that construction sites and installation projects constitute permanent establishments only if they exceed specified duration thresholds—twelve months under the OECD Model, six months under the UN Model. Enterprises could avoid these thresholds by dividing projects into multiple contracts, each falling below the threshold, or by using related enterprises to perform sequential portions of the work.

A single eighteen-month project might be divided between two related companies, each performing work for less than twelve months. While the combined activity represented a continuous presence exceeding the threshold, no single enterprise triggered permanent establishment status.

## 3. The Action 7 Final Report

### 3.1. Recommendations Overview

The Action 7 Final Report, published in October 2015, recommended changes addressing all three identified strategies. The recommendations modified Article 5(5) on agency permanent establishments, Article 5(4) on specific activity exemptions, and Article 5(6) on independent agents, while adding new provisions on anti-fragmentation and closely related enterprises.

### 3.2. Agency Permanent Establishment Reforms

The most significant change addressed commissionaire arrangements. The pre-2017 requirement that agents conclude contracts "in the name of" the enterprise was replaced with a broader formulation. Under the revised Article 5(5), an enterprise has a permanent establishment where a person acting on its behalf habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification.

The "principal role" language specifically targets commissionaire arrangements. Even where contracts are formally concluded in the agent's name, if the agent plays the principal role in bringing about contracts that the enterprise routinely approves, a permanent establishment exists. The focus shifts from formal contract conclusion to substantive involvement in the contracting process.

The phrase "routinely concluded without material modification" addresses arrangements where the enterprise nominally reviews contracts but in practice approves them as negotiated by the agent. If the enterprise's review is a formality rather than substantive evaluation, the agent's role in bringing about the contract is what matters.

### 3.3. Specific Activity Exemption Reforms

The 2017 revision eliminated automatic exemptions for the listed activities. All activities in Article 5(4)(a) through (e) must now satisfy the preparatory or auxiliary character test. A large-scale distribution warehouse can no longer claim exemption simply because "delivery" appears in subparagraph (a); the enterprise must demonstrate that the warehouse's activities are genuinely preparatory or auxiliary to its core business.

A new anti-fragmentation rule in Article 5(4.1) prevents enterprises from exploiting exemptions by dividing operations among multiple locations or related entities. Where an enterprise or a closely related enterprise carries on activities at the same place or different places in the same State, and either the combination constitutes a permanent establishment or the combined activities are not preparatory or auxiliary, the exemptions do not apply.

### 3.4. Independent Agent Exception

The 2017 reforms narrowed the independent agent exception in Article 5(6). An agent who acts exclusively or almost exclusively for one or more closely related enterprises cannot qualify as independent, regardless of other indicia of independence. This prevents enterprises from claiming the exception for captive intermediaries whose sole function is serving the enterprise group.

The "closely related enterprise" concept, defined in Article 5(8), applies a more-than-50-percent ownership or control threshold. This definition supports both the anti-fragmentation rule and the narrowed independent agent exception.

## 4. Implementation Through the MLI

### 4.1. MLI Articles 12-15

The Multilateral Instrument implements Action 7 recommendations through four articles. Article 12 addresses commissionaire arrangements, implementing the expanded agency permanent establishment concept. Article 13 addresses specific activity exemptions, offering options for implementing the preparatory or auxiliary requirement. Article 14 addresses contract splitting for construction projects. Article 15 defines "closely related person," which must be adopted if any of Articles 12-14 are adopted.

### 4.2. Optional Status

Action 7 is not a BEPS minimum standard. Unlike Actions 5, 6, 13, and 14, which require compliance by Inclusive Framework members, Action 7 adoption is voluntary. Countries may choose which articles to adopt, which options to select, or may opt out entirely.

This optional status reflects the contentious nature of permanent establishment expansion. Residence States, whose enterprises might face new permanent establishment findings abroad, have less incentive to adopt expansive definitions. Source States, seeking to tax economic activity within their borders, favour broader definitions. The optional approach allows each jurisdiction to balance these interests according to its circumstances.

### 4.3. Country Positions

Country positions on MLI permanent establishment provisions vary significantly. As of late 2025, 105 jurisdictions have signed the MLI, with 88 having deposited ratification instruments. However, adoption of the permanent establishment provisions differs markedly.

For Article 13 on specific activity exemptions, Australia, India, Japan, and New Zealand have adopted Option A, which requires all listed activities to satisfy the preparatory or auxiliary test. France, Ireland, Singapore, and Luxembourg have adopted Option B, which applies the anti-fragmentation rule but maintains per se exemptions for the listed activities. The United Kingdom has adopted neither option, preserving the pre-2017 approach in its treaty network. Canada and Finland have opted out of Article 13 entirely.

Research indicates that capital-importing countries, typically in the Global South, are significantly more likely to adopt the permanent establishment provisions than capital-exporting countries. This pattern reflects the provisions' effect of shifting taxing rights from residence to source States.

## 5. Profit Attribution Guidance

### 5.1. The Attribution Challenge

The expanded permanent establishment definitions create new taxable presences, but determining what profits are attributable to these permanent establishments presents challenges. A commissionaire-arrangement permanent establishment does not have traditional assets or employees of its own; the commissionaire entity holds the assets and employs the personnel. The permanent establishment is a deemed presence rather than a physical operation.

### 5.2. The March 2018 Guidance

The OECD published Additional Guidance on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments under BEPS Action 7 in March 2018. This guidance applies the Authorised OECD Approach (AOA) to permanent establishments arising from the revised definitions, requiring functional analysis of activities performed, assets used, and risks assumed.

The guidance includes detailed examples addressing commissionaire structures for sale of goods, online advertising sales structures, and procurement structures. Each example demonstrates how to identify significant people functions and attribute profits accordingly.

### 5.3. Limited Functions, Limited Profits

A key principle in the 2018 guidance is that expanded permanent establishment definitions do not justify expanded profit attribution. These permanent establishments typically perform limited functions—primarily the negotiation or facilitation of contracts—while the enterprise's core functions remain elsewhere. Profit attribution should reflect this reality.

For a commissionaire-arrangement permanent establishment, the attributable profits would typically be a commission-type return for contract negotiation, not the full distribution margin. The commissionaire entity itself receives arm's length remuneration under transfer pricing principles; the permanent establishment receives an attribution reflecting any additional functions not compensated through that remuneration.

Coordination between Article 7 (permanent establishment profit attribution) and Article 9 (transfer pricing) is essential to avoid double counting. The total profits attributed to the permanent establishment and paid to the commissionaire entity should not exceed what the combined activities would generate.

## 6. Relationship to Other BEPS Actions

### 6.1. Digital Economy Connections

Action 7 connects closely with Action 1 on the digital economy. Digital businesses often avoided permanent establishment status by conducting sales through online platforms without physical presence in customer jurisdictions. While Action 7's reforms address some digital economy concerns—particularly regarding local personnel who facilitate online sales—they do not fully address highly digitalised business models that operate entirely remotely.

The relationship between Action 7 and subsequent Pillar One developments is significant. Pillar One proposes new taxing rights based on market presence rather than physical establishment, representing a more fundamental departure from traditional permanent establishment concepts than Action 7's targeted reforms.

### 6.2. Transfer Pricing Integration

Actions 8-10 on transfer pricing complement Action 7. Where a permanent establishment exists, profit attribution applies transfer pricing principles. The functional analysis required for profit attribution mirrors the analysis required for pricing transactions between associated enterprises. Consistency between permanent establishment attribution and transfer pricing ensures coherent treatment of enterprise profits.

### 6.3. Country-by-Country Reporting

Action 13 on country-by-country reporting supports Action 7 implementation by increasing transparency about where enterprises conduct activities. Tax authorities with access to country-by-country reports can identify potential permanent establishment situations more readily, comparing reported presence with permanent establishment filings.

## 7. Practical Implications

### 7.1. Restructuring Responses

Many enterprises have restructured operations in response to Action 7. Common responses include converting commissionaire arrangements to limited risk distributor structures, where the local entity takes title to goods and bears inventory risk, accepting permanent establishment status but managing attribution through transfer pricing.

Other enterprises have increased substance in source countries, accepting that local presence will create permanent establishments but ensuring that profit attribution reflects genuine local functions. This approach aligns with the BEPS project's broader objective of taxing profits where economic activity occurs.

### 7.2. Documentation Requirements

Action 7 implementation has increased documentation burdens. Enterprises must document the preparatory or auxiliary character of activities claiming exemption, maintain evidence of agent independence where relevant, and justify construction contract structures where aggregation might apply.

Functional analysis documentation for profit attribution purposes has become essential. Enterprises must identify significant people functions performed at permanent establishments and demonstrate that profit attribution reflects these functions appropriately.

## 8. Critical Assessment and Discussion

The Action 7 reforms represent a significant but incomplete response to permanent establishment avoidance. The commissionaire amendments address a genuine gap in the pre-2017 rules, closing an escape route that produced different tax consequences for economically equivalent arrangements. The Spanish Dell decision demonstrated that courts could reach the intended result even under the old language, but the amendments provide greater certainty.

The anti-fragmentation rule addresses a real problem but creates implementation challenges. Determining when activities constitute "complementary functions of a cohesive business operation" requires judgment that may be applied inconsistently across jurisdictions. Enterprises face uncertainty about how aggregation principles will be applied in practice.

The optional status of Action 7 has produced uneven implementation. Research indicates that only 29 countries opted to implement certain permanent establishment provisions through the MLI, limiting the reforms' practical impact. The divergence between capital-importing and capital-exporting countries' positions suggests that residence-source tensions continue to shape international tax outcomes.

The 2018 profit attribution guidance appropriately limits the consequences of expanded permanent establishment definitions. Critics had worried that new permanent establishments would attract disproportionate profit attribution; the guidance's emphasis on limited functions and limited profits addresses this concern. However, some commentators argue that if profit attribution remains minimal, the expanded definitions achieve little beyond compliance costs.

The relationship between Action 7 and digital economy taxation remains unresolved. The reforms address some digital economy concerns but do not fundamentally alter the requirement for physical presence. Highly digitalised businesses can still operate in jurisdictions without permanent establishments, generating revenue without taxable presence. Pillar One represents a more ambitious response to this challenge, though its implementation remains uncertain.

The uneven implementation of Action 7 raises questions about the effectiveness of voluntary BEPS measures. Where minimum standards apply, compliance is monitored through peer review with real consequences for non-compliance. Action 7's optional status means that enterprises operating in jurisdictions that have not adopted the reforms can continue using structures that would trigger permanent establishment findings elsewhere. This creates arbitrage opportunities and perpetuates the very planning strategies Action 7 was designed to address.

Looking forward, the permanent establishment concept faces pressure from multiple directions. The 2025 OECD update on home office permanent establishments demonstrates that new working arrangements require ongoing refinement of traditional concepts. The continuing debate about digital economy taxation suggests that more fundamental changes may be necessary to capture economic activity that occurs without traditional physical presence. Action 7's reforms, while valuable, represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary change to a concept that some commentators argue has outlived its utility in an increasingly digitalised global economy.

The interaction between Action 7 and domestic anti-avoidance rules also warrants attention. Some jurisdictions apply domestic permanent establishment concepts that differ from treaty definitions, potentially creating permanent establishments under domestic law even where treaty protections would otherwise apply. The relationship between treaty-based and domestic approaches to permanent establishment avoidance remains an area of ongoing development in international tax jurisprudence.
