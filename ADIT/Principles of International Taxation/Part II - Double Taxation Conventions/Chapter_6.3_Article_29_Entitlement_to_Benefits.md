## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE ANTI-ABUSE GATEWAY

### 1.1 Purpose of Article 29

Article 29 is the **primary anti-abuse provision** in the OECD MTC 2017. While Articles 1 and 4 establish who is a "resident" for treaty purposes, Article 29 determines whether that resident is **entitled** to treaty benefits.

**Key question Article 29 answers**:
> **"Even if the person is a resident, should they receive treaty benefits?"**

### 1.2 Background: Treaty Shopping and BEPS

Treaty shopping—the practice of obtaining treaty benefits indirectly by residents of third States—was identified by BEPS Action 6 as a principal source of BEPS concerns. Article 29 was substantially expanded in 2017 to implement the Action 6 recommendations.

**The minimum standard** under Action 6 requires:
1. An express statement on non-taxation (Preamble)
2. One of three anti-abuse mechanisms:
   - PPT alone
   - Combined LOB and PPT
   - Detailed LOB plus conduit mechanism

### 2.2 Two Main Approaches

The OECD MTC offers two complementary approaches that can be used alone or together:

| Approach | Paragraphs | Nature |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **LOB (Limitation on Benefits)** | 1-7 | Detailed rule-based approach; objective tests |
| **PPT (Principal Purpose Test)** | 9 | General anti-abuse; subjective purpose test |

**Most jurisdictions** have adopted the PPT alone or PPT plus simplified LOB under the MLI.

---

## 3. THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE TEST (PPT) – ARTICLE 29(9)

### 3.1 The Provision

**Article 29(9)**:
> *"Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention."*

### 3.2 Elements of the PPT

### 3.3 Commentary Guidance on PPT

**Commentary [177]**: The PPT applies where one of the principal purposes was to obtain a treaty benefit. This contrasts with "sole or main purpose" tests requiring a higher threshold.

**Commentary [178]**: A purpose will not be a "principal" purpose when it is reasonable to conclude that obtaining the benefit was not a principal consideration and would not have justified entering into any arrangement or transaction.

**Commentary [181]** (Examples): The Commentary provides detailed examples of when PPT applies or doesn't apply—these are examinable.

### 3.4 PPT vs Other Purpose Tests

| Test | Threshold | Used In |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Principal purpose** (PPT) | One of the principal purposes | Article 29(9) |
| **Main purpose** | The main purpose | Some domestic GAARs |
| **Sole purpose** | The only purpose | Older anti-avoidance rules |
| **Main or one of main purposes** | High threshold | UK anti-avoidance legislation |

The PPT has a **relatively low threshold**—the benefit need only be "one of" the principal purposes.

### 3.5 Criticisms of the PPT

Academic commentary and the December 2024 exam noted:

| Criticism | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| **Legal uncertainty** | "One of the principal purposes" is vague |
| **Discretion to tax authorities** | "Reasonable to conclude" gives authorities wide discretion |
| **Chilling effect** | Genuine transactions may be deterred |
| **Standards vs rules debate** | PPT is a "standard" requiring case-by-case interpretation (Baistrocchi, 2021) |

**December 2024 reference**: *"The international tax regime has been described as having been transformed from a standards-based to rules-based system and back to a standards-based system since 2015... the principal purpose test (PPT), requiring case-by-case interpretation."*

## 4. LIMITATION ON BENEFITS (LOB) – ARTICLES 29(1)-(7)

### 4.1 Overview

The LOB is a **detailed, rule-based** approach to treaty entitlement. Unlike the subjective PPT, the LOB provides **objective tests** that residents must satisfy.

### 4.2 Qualified Persons (Article 29(2))

**Automatically entitled** to treaty benefits if the person is a "qualified person":

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.3 Active Conduct of Business (Article 29(3))

Non-qualified persons may still be entitled if:
- They are engaged in **active conduct of a business** in their State of residence
- The income is derived in connection with or incidental to that business
- The business is **substantial** in relation to the activity in the source State

### 4.4 Derivative Benefits (Article 29(4))

A company may be entitled if:
- 75%+ of its shares are held by "equivalent beneficiaries"
- Equivalent beneficiaries = persons who would be entitled to same or better benefits if they received the income directly

### 4.5 Headquarters Companies (Article 29(5))

A headquarters company may be entitled if it provides:
- **General supervision and administration** of a group of companies
- Exercises **independent discretionary authority**
- Is subject to the same income taxation as qualified persons

### 4.6 Discretionary Benefits (Article 29(6))

If a person fails the above tests, they may still apply to the **competent authority** for a determination that benefits should be granted. The CA considers:
- Whether the person's establishment/acquisition was for bona fide purposes
- Whether granting benefits is appropriate in the circumstances

## 5. MLI AND BEPS ACTION 6 IMPLEMENTATION

### 5.1 The Minimum Standard

BEPS Action 6 established a **minimum standard** for treaty abuse that all Inclusive Framework members committed to implement:

### 5.2 MLI Article 7

The MLI implements Article 29 through **Article 7** (Prevention of Treaty Abuse):
- Replicates Article 29 of the OECD MTC
- Allows jurisdictions to choose PPT, LOB, or combination
- Has been adopted by the vast majority of MLI signatories

**December 2023 exam reference**: *"As at 31 May 2022, more than 1,050 DTAs (that are CTAs) concluded by members of the Inclusive Framework comply with the minimum standard in Action 6."*

### 5.3 Peer Review Process

The Action 6 minimum standard is subject to **peer review**:
- Annual assessment of treaty networks
- Evaluation of compliance with minimum standard
- Public reporting on implementation progress

**Fifth Peer Review Report (2023)**: More than 2,385 agreements are either compliant or subject to steps to achieve compliance.

### 6.2 PPT Applies "Notwithstanding"

Article 29(9) begins: *"Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention..."*

This means:
- PPT can deny benefits even if all other requirements are met
- It is a **catch-all** provision
- Operates as final anti-abuse backstop

## 7. ARTICLE 29: UN MDTC DIFFERENCES

### 7.1 Comparison

The UN Model takes a **similar but not identical** approach:

| Element | OECD MTC | UN MDTC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **PPT** | Article 29(9) | Included |
| **Full LOB** | Articles 29(1)-(7) | Simplified version |
| **Discretionary benefits** | CA determination | Similar approach |
| **Emphasis** | Developed country concerns | Developing country concerns |

### 7.2 Developing Country Considerations

Developing countries may face:
- Greater treaty shopping risks (as December 2024 exam noted)
- Limited resources to apply complex LOB
- Preference for simpler PPT approach

### 8.4 Common Exam Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Treating PPT as requiring "sole purpose" | PPT requires only "one of the principal purposes" |
| Ignoring object and purpose escape | Always mention the escape clause in PPT analysis |
| Applying LOB without checking PPT | PPT applies even if LOB tests are satisfied |
| Forgetting BEPS Action 6 context | Link to minimum standard and peer review |
| Not distinguishing LOB from PPT | LOB = objective tests; PPT = subjective purpose |

*This note covers syllabus topic II.F.3: Article 29: Entitlement to Benefits (Level 3). Article 29 is the primary anti-abuse provision in the OECD MTC, implementing BEPS Action 6 minimum standard. It provides two approaches: the Limitation on Benefits (LOB) with objective tests for qualified persons, and the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) which denies benefits where obtaining them was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement. The PPT applies "notwithstanding" other provisions and has been adopted by the vast majority of jurisdictions through the MLI.*
