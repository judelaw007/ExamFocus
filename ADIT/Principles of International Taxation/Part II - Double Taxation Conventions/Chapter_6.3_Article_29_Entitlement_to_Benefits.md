# Chapter 6.3: Scope of a DTC – Article 29: Entitlement to Benefits

## 1. The Anti-Abuse Gateway

### 1.1. Purpose and Function

Article 29 is the primary anti-abuse provision in the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017. While Articles 1 and 4 establish who qualifies as a resident for treaty purposes, Article 29 determines whether that resident is entitled to treaty benefits. The distinction is fundamental: residence is necessary but not sufficient for treaty entitlement. A person may be a resident of a Contracting State and yet be denied treaty benefits if Article 29's requirements are not satisfied.

The question Article 29 answers is whether, even though a person is a resident, they should receive treaty benefits. This inquiry arises because treaty shopping—the practice of accessing treaty benefits by residents of third States through interposed entities—became a principal concern in international tax policy. Treaty shopping undermines the reciprocal bargain between Contracting States: each State agrees to limit its taxing rights on the assumption that benefits flow to genuine residents of the other State, not to residents of non-treaty jurisdictions who have structured their affairs to access benefits indirectly.

### 1.2. BEPS Action 6 Background

BEPS Action 6 identified treaty abuse, particularly treaty shopping, as one of the principal sources of base erosion and profit shifting concerns. The Action 6 Final Report recommended a minimum standard that all Inclusive Framework members committed to implement. This minimum standard comprises two components: first, an express statement in the treaty preamble that the convention is not intended to create opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including treaty shopping; second, adoption of one of three anti-abuse mechanisms.

Article 29 in its current form reflects these Action 6 recommendations. The 2017 OECD Model substantially expanded Article 29 to provide comprehensive entitlement provisions, replacing the relatively sparse anti-abuse measures in earlier Models.

## 2. Article 29 Structure

### 2.1. The Two Approaches

Article 29 provides two complementary approaches to determining entitlement, which may be used alone or in combination.

The Limitation on Benefits provisions in paragraphs 1 through 7 represent a detailed, rule-based approach. These provisions define categories of "qualified persons" who are automatically entitled to treaty benefits, along with alternative tests for persons who do not fall within those categories. The LOB approach provides legal certainty through objective criteria: a person either satisfies the requirements or does not.

The Principal Purpose Test in paragraph 9 represents a general anti-abuse provision taking a standards-based approach. The PPT denies benefits where obtaining them was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement, unless granting the benefits would accord with the treaty's object and purpose. Unlike the LOB's objective tests, the PPT requires case-by-case evaluation of purpose and circumstances.

Most jurisdictions have adopted the PPT alone, or the PPT combined with a simplified LOB, through the Multilateral Instrument. The United States has historically preferred detailed LOB provisions without the PPT, reflecting a preference for legal certainty over flexible anti-abuse standards.

### 2.2. Relationship with Other Anti-Abuse Provisions

Article 29 operates as part of an integrated anti-abuse framework. The treaty preamble expresses the Contracting States' intention not to create opportunities for tax avoidance. Article 1, as discussed in the Commentary, is one of the key provisions through which this intention takes effect. The beneficial ownership requirements in Articles 10, 11, and 12 provide specific anti-abuse protections for dividends, interest, and royalties.

Article 29(9) applies "notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention." This language confirms that the PPT operates as a backstop: even if a person satisfies all other treaty requirements—residence, beneficial ownership, specific article conditions—benefits may still be denied if the PPT applies. The PPT thus functions as the final anti-abuse filter.

## 3. The Principal Purpose Test (Article 29(9))

### 3.1. The Provision

Article 29(9) provides: "Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention."

This single provision contains multiple elements that must be analysed separately.

### 3.2. The Reasonableness Test

The first element is the "reasonable to conclude" standard. This is an objective test assessed by reference to all relevant facts and circumstances. The inquiry is not into the taxpayer's subjective state of mind but into what a reasonable observer would conclude from the objective evidence.

Commentary paragraph 177 indicates that this standard requires the tax authority to demonstrate that it is reasonable—not certain, but reasonable—to conclude that obtaining the benefit was a principal purpose. The burden initially rests with the authority invoking the PPT.

Factors relevant to the reasonableness assessment include the timing and sequence of transactions, the commercial rationale (if any) for the arrangement, the residence of ultimate beneficial owners, the substance of interposed entities, and comparisons between the taxpayer's actual structure and alternative structures that would not generate treaty benefits.

### 3.3. "One of the Principal Purposes"

The second element is the threshold for purpose: the treaty benefit must have been "one of the principal purposes" of the arrangement. This language differs significantly from "the sole purpose," "the main purpose," or "the predominant purpose." It is sufficient if obtaining the benefit was one among multiple principal purposes; the benefit need not have been the sole or even the primary motivation.

Commentary paragraph 178 provides guidance: a purpose is not "principal" if it is reasonable to conclude that obtaining the benefit was not a principal consideration and would not have justified entering into the arrangement. This suggests a materiality threshold: the benefit must have been a significant, though not necessarily the most significant, factor in the taxpayer's decision-making.

This relatively low threshold has attracted criticism for creating uncertainty and potentially chilling legitimate transactions. Past examinations have noted the tension between the PPT's flexibility and the legal certainty that taxpayers require for planning purposes.

### 3.4. The Object and Purpose Exception

The third element provides an escape clause: benefits shall not be denied if it is established that granting them "would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention."

This exception shifts the burden to the taxpayer. Even where the tax authority has shown that obtaining the benefit was a principal purpose, the taxpayer may still receive the benefit by demonstrating consistency with the treaty's object and purpose.

The Commentary provides examples. If a holding company resident in one Contracting State receives dividends from a subsidiary in the other State, and the holding company was established partly to access reduced dividend withholding rates, the PPT prima facie applies. However, if the holding company conducts genuine business activities and the dividend article was designed to promote cross-border investment by reducing withholding, granting the benefit may accord with the treaty's object and purpose despite the tax-motivated element.

This exception represents what some commentators call the "valve" in the PPT: a mechanism preventing the provision from operating too broadly and denying benefits in circumstances the treaty was designed to accommodate.

### 3.5. Emerging Case Law

Domestic court decisions applying the PPT remain limited, as the provision was introduced only in 2017 and took effect in many treaties through the MLI from 2019 onwards. However, early decisions provide guidance.

In SC Lowy P.I. (LUX) S.A.R.L. v. ACIT (2023), the Delhi Income Tax Appellate Tribunal examined the PPT under the India-Luxembourg treaty. The taxpayer was a Luxembourg company owned by a Cayman-based entity, investing in Indian assets. The tax authority denied treaty benefits, arguing treaty shopping.

The Tribunal ruled for the taxpayer. It found that the taxpayer's investments in other jurisdictions exceeded its Indian investments, that it had incurred substantial operational expenditure, and that there was commercial rationale for the Luxembourg structure. Importantly, the Tribunal placed the burden of proof on the tax authorities to support their allegation that obtaining treaty benefits was a principal purpose. This approach suggests that courts may require tax authorities to make a positive case for PPT application rather than presuming abuse from structural arrangements.

India's Central Board of Direct Taxes subsequently issued Circular 1 of 2025 clarifying that the PPT applies prospectively and that shares acquired before April 2017 (grandfathered shares) remain outside PPT scope. This regulatory guidance reflects ongoing implementation challenges.

## 4. Limitation on Benefits (Articles 29(1)-(7))

### 4.1. Qualified Persons

Article 29(2) defines categories of "qualified persons" who are automatically entitled to treaty benefits without further inquiry.

Individuals who are residents of a Contracting State qualify automatically. The rationale is that individuals cannot engage in the corporate structuring typical of treaty shopping.

Contracting States and their political subdivisions or local authorities qualify, as do entities wholly owned by such governmental bodies. Government entities are not vehicles for treaty shopping.

Publicly traded companies qualify if their principal class of shares is regularly traded on a recognised stock exchange. The theory is that widely-held public companies are unlikely to be treaty shopping vehicles because their ownership is diffuse and unrelated to tax planning by any particular shareholder.

Pension funds established to provide retirement benefits qualify, as do non-profit organisations operated exclusively for religious, charitable, educational, scientific, or similar purposes. These entities serve public purposes that make treaty shopping concerns inapplicable.

Other entities may qualify if they satisfy ownership and base erosion tests. The ownership test typically requires that more than 50% of voting power and value be held, directly or indirectly, by qualified persons. The base erosion test requires that less than 50% of gross income be paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, to persons who are not residents of either Contracting State.

### 4.2. Active Conduct of Business

Article 29(3) provides an alternative for persons who are not qualified persons. A resident may be entitled to treaty benefits with respect to an item of income if it is engaged in the active conduct of a business in its State of residence, the income is derived in connection with or is incidental to that business, and the business is substantial in relation to the activity generating the income in the source State.

This provision recognises that a genuine business enterprise should not be denied treaty benefits merely because it fails the qualified person tests. The "substantial" requirement prevents abuse: a minimal business cannot justify benefits on income from a much larger source-State activity.

### 4.3. Derivative Benefits and Discretionary Relief

Article 29(4) provides a derivative benefits test. A company may be entitled to treaty benefits if 75% or more of its shares are owned by "equivalent beneficiaries"—persons who would be entitled to equal or better benefits if they received the income directly under their own treaties with the source State.

Article 29(6) provides discretionary relief. If a person fails all objective tests, it may request the competent authority to grant benefits. The competent authority considers whether the person's establishment, acquisition, or maintenance was for bona fide purposes and whether granting benefits is appropriate in the circumstances. This mechanism ensures that legitimate arrangements are not denied benefits merely because they fail technical tests.

## 5. BEPS Action 6 Minimum Standard

### 5.1. The Three Options

The Action 6 minimum standard requires adoption of preamble language plus one of three anti-abuse options.

Option A is the PPT alone—Article 29(9) or equivalent. This has been the most widely adopted approach, chosen by the vast majority of MLI signatories.

Option B combines the PPT with a simplified LOB. This provides some categorical certainty while retaining the PPT as a backstop.

Option C uses a detailed LOB plus an anti-conduit mechanism, without the PPT. This approach provides maximum legal certainty through objective rules and has been the traditional US preference.

### 5.2. MLI Article 7 Implementation

The Multilateral Instrument implements the minimum standard through Article 7 (Prevention of Treaty Abuse). Article 7 allows signatories to choose among the three options and modifies their covered tax agreements accordingly.

As of the Sixth Peer Review Report (March 2024), over 1,120 bilateral agreements have been brought into compliance with the minimum standard through the MLI, with approximately 630 additional agreements to become compliant once all signatories complete ratification. The total number of compliant agreements between Inclusive Framework members exceeded 1,270 by May 2023.

### 5.3. Peer Review Process

The Action 6 minimum standard is subject to peer review by the Inclusive Framework. The peer review process assesses whether members' treaty networks comply with the minimum standard and makes recommendations where gaps exist.

The Sixth Peer Review Report (2024) introduced revised methodology: comprehensive reviews will occur every five years rather than annually, with the OECD Secretariat providing interim support. The 2024 report covered 142 jurisdictions and noted that 12 jurisdictions received recommendations to complete steps to have the MLI take effect, while 4 jurisdictions received recommendations to develop implementation plans.

## 6. Criticisms and Discussion

The PPT has attracted criticism from multiple perspectives. The "one of the principal purposes" threshold is considered vague, creating legal uncertainty for taxpayers who cannot reliably predict whether their arrangements will withstand PPT scrutiny. The "reasonable to conclude" standard grants significant discretion to tax authorities, potentially enabling aggressive challenges to legitimate structures.

Academic commentary, including work by Lang (2024) and Baistrocchi (2021), has characterised the PPT as representing a shift from rules-based to standards-based international taxation. Rules provide certainty but may be circumvented; standards provide flexibility but create uncertainty. The PPT exemplifies the standards approach, requiring case-by-case interpretation rather than mechanical application.

The December 2024 examination referenced this tension, noting that the international tax regime has been described as having transformed from a standards-based to a rules-based system and back to standards since 2015, with the PPT requiring case-by-case interpretation.

Some commentators argue that the PPT may chill legitimate transactions. Enterprises may avoid structures that would attract PPT scrutiny even where those structures have genuine commercial rationale, because the uncertainty of PPT outcomes makes the risk unacceptable. This chilling effect may be inefficient if it prevents commercially valuable arrangements.

Others counter that the PPT's flexibility is precisely its virtue. Rigid rules invite circumvention; standards that focus on purpose and substance are harder to game. The object and purpose exception provides a release valve for legitimate cases.

The practical significance of this debate extends beyond academic discussion. Tax advisers structuring cross-border investments must consider PPT risk, and the absence of clear precedent makes advice difficult. The SC Lowy decision, while taxpayer-favourable, is a single Tribunal ruling that may not bind higher courts or other jurisdictions. Until a body of case law develops establishing how the PPT operates in practice, uncertainty will persist.

The interaction between LOB and PPT also raises questions. Where both apply, a person satisfying all LOB tests might still face PPT challenge. This raises the question whether LOB satisfaction should create a presumption of entitlement, with the PPT reserved for egregious cases. The Commentary does not clearly resolve this relationship, leaving it for domestic courts and competent authorities to develop.

## 7. UN Model and Developing Country Perspective

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention 2021 includes Article 29 provisions similar to the OECD Model, including the PPT. However, the UN Model has traditionally offered simplified LOB provisions recognising that developing countries may lack the administrative capacity to apply complex objective tests.

From a developing country perspective, treaty shopping poses particular risks. Developing countries are typically net capital importers with extensive treaty networks offering reduced withholding rates. These treaties may be exploited by investors routing investments through favourable jurisdictions, eroding source-State tax bases without corresponding residence-State taxation.

The UN's 2024 work has introduced a "subject to tax rule" denying treaty benefits for income that is subject to no or very low taxation in the residence country. This complements the PPT by addressing arrangements where the residence country does not actually tax the income for which treaty benefits are claimed.

India's experience illustrates developing country concerns. The India-Mauritius treaty, historically offering capital gains exemption, was exploited by investors worldwide routing investments through Mauritius. India renegotiated the treaty in 2016, and the revised treaty with PPT provisions took effect in April 2024. The CBDT's January 2025 circular on PPT prospectivity and grandfathering reflects efforts to provide transitional certainty while implementing anti-abuse measures.
