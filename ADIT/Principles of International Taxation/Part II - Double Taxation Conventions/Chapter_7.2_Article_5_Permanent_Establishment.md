## 1. INTRODUCTION: WHY PE MATTERS

The permanent establishment (PE) concept is one of the most critical provisions in tax treaty law. It serves as the **threshold for source state taxation of business profits**. Under Article 7, business profits of an enterprise resident in one Contracting State are taxable only in that state, *unless* the enterprise carries on business in the other state through a PE situated there. Only then can the source state tax the profits attributable to that PE.

This means that without a PE, a foreign enterprise can conduct business activities in a country and remain outside that country's taxing jurisdiction on business profits - making the PE definition a crucial battleground between source states seeking to tax and enterprises seeking to minimise their tax footprint.

The PE concept has been significantly reformed by BEPS Action 7 (2015), with changes incorporated into the OECD MTC 2017, designed to prevent artificial avoidance of PE status through commissionaire arrangements and exploitation of preparatory/auxiliary activity exemptions.

## 2. ARTICLE 5 STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

Article 5 follows a logical structure:

| Paragraph | Content | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Art 5(1)** | Basic definition | Positive test - what constitutes a PE |
| **Art 5(2)** | Inclusive list | Examples of fixed places that are PEs |
| **Art 5(3)** | Construction PE | Building sites, installation projects |
| **Art 5(4)** | Negative list | Activities specifically excluded |
| **Art 5(5)** | Agency PE (DAPE) | Dependent agent creates PE |
| **Art 5(6)** | Independent agent | No PE through independent agent |
| **Art 5(7)** | Parent-subsidiary | Control alone doesn't create PE |
| **Art 5(8)** | UN only - Service PE | Services without fixed place |

---

## 3. ARTICLE 5(1): THE BASIC PE DEFINITION

### 3.1 The Core Test

**Article 5(1) OECD MTC:**
> "For the purposes of this Convention, the term 'permanent establishment' means a **fixed place of business** through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on."

This definition contains **three cumulative requirements**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           THREE ELEMENTS OF A PE (ALL MUST BE MET)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  1. PLACE OF BUSINESS                                           │
│     • Premises, facilities, installations, or equipment         │
│     • Can be rented, owned, or at the disposal of enterprise    │
│     • Need not be exclusive to the enterprise                   │
│                                                                 │
│  2. FIXITY (Temporal and Geographic)                            │
│     • Sufficient degree of permanence                           │
│     • Located in a particular place                             │
│     • Not merely temporary or intermittent                      │
│                                                                 │
│  3. BUSINESS CARRIED ON THROUGH IT                              │
│     • Enterprise must conduct its business at that place        │
│     • Usually through personnel present there                   │
│     • Connection between place and business activities          │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Place of Business

The Commentary confirms this is broadly interpreted:
- **Physical presence not essential**: Virtual offices may qualify in certain circumstances
- **At disposal of enterprise**: The enterprise must have the location "at its disposal" - meaning available for its business use
- **Need not be owned or rented**: Can be provided by a client or third party
- **Can be shared**: Multiple enterprises can use the same place

**Commentary Example**: An employee who uses a room in their home for business purposes may create a PE for their employer if the home office is "at the disposal of" the enterprise - though this requires the enterprise to have required or induced the use.

### 3.3 Fixity

The "fixed" requirement has two dimensions:

**Geographic Fixity:**
- Must be linked to a particular geographic point
- Can be a defined area (e.g., mining site) rather than single building
- Mobile activities can still constitute a fixed place if confined to a coherent geographic area

**Temporal Fixity:**
- Requires sufficient permanence
- No absolute minimum duration, but generally **6 months** suggested in Commentary
- Shorter periods may qualify if:
  - Nature of business is inherently short-term
  - Business is recurrent at same location
  - Business prematurely terminated

### 3.4 Business Carried On Through the Place

The activities performed at the location must be **core business activities** of the enterprise (not merely ancillary). The business must be carried on "through" that place, typically requiring:
- Personnel present at the location
- Some connection between the place and the business functions

---

## 4. ARTICLE 5(2): THE INCLUSIVE LIST

Article 5(2) provides a non-exhaustive list of examples that **especially constitute PEs**:

| Item | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **(a)** | Place of management | Where business decisions are made |
| **(b)** | Branch | Self-explanatory - local branch office |
| **(c)** | Office | Administrative or commercial office |
| **(d)** | Factory | Manufacturing facility |
| **(e)** | Workshop | Production or repair facility |
| **(f)** | Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or other place of extraction of natural resources | Resource extraction sites |

**Important**: These are examples, not an exhaustive definition. The basic test in Article 5(1) always applies. An item on this list still requires the three elements to be met.

### UN Model Variation: Article 5(2)(g)-(h)

The UN MDTC adds:
- **(g)** A farm or plantation
- **(h)** A warehouse (in relation to a person providing storage facilities for others)

These additions reflect developing country concerns about ensuring taxation of agricultural and logistics operations.

---

## 5. ARTICLE 5(3): CONSTRUCTION PE

### 5.1 The Rule

**OECD MTC Article 5(3):**
> "A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than **twelve months**."

**UN MDTC Article 5(3)(a):**
> Duration threshold is only **six months**.

### 5.2 Key Interpretation Issues

**What counts as "construction or installation project"?**
- Building construction
- Road and bridge construction
- Installation of machinery or equipment
- Planning and supervision services relating to construction (per Commentary)

**When does the clock start/stop?**
- Starts: When preparatory work begins at the site
- Ends: When work is completed or permanently abandoned
- Temporary interruptions do not stop the clock

**Anti-fragmentation:**
- Related projects at the same site are aggregated
- Splitting contracts into sub-12-month segments to avoid PE is ineffective if the work is essentially a single project

### 5.3 Exam Application

```
EXAM TIP: Construction PE Questions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
When analysing construction PE:
1. Identify total project duration (start to completion)
2. Check treaty threshold (12 months OECD / 6 months UN)
3. Consider if multiple contracts should be aggregated
4. Look for artificial splitting of single projects
```

---

## 6. ARTICLE 5(4): THE NEGATIVE LIST - PREPARATORY AND AUXILIARY ACTIVITIES

### 6.1 The Exclusions

Article 5(4) provides that a PE is **not** deemed to exist for:

| Subpara | Activity | Condition |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **(a)** | Storage, display, or delivery of goods | Of the enterprise |
| **(b)** | Stock of goods maintained for storage/display/delivery | By another enterprise |
| **(c)** | Stock of goods for processing by another | Processing by third party |
| **(d)** | Fixed place for purchasing goods or collecting information | For the enterprise |
| **(e)** | Fixed place for any other preparatory/auxiliary activity | General catch-all |
| **(f)** | Combination of (a)-(e) | Overall must be prep/aux |

### 6.2 The Pre-2017 Problem

Before BEPS Action 7 reforms, Article 5(4)(a)-(d) exemptions were **automatic** - the listed activities were deemed preparatory or auxiliary without further analysis. This allowed MNEs to:
- Maintain large distribution warehouses that were technically "delivery" facilities
- Operate substantial purchasing operations
- Combine multiple exempted activities into significant operations

### 6.3 The 2017 Anti-Fragmentation Rule

**EXAM ALERT: December 2022 directly tested the 2017 changes to Article 5(4)**

The OECD MTC 2017 made two key changes:

**Change 1: Preparatory/Auxiliary Requirement Extended**

The revised Article 5(4) now states:
> "provided that such activity or, in the case of subparagraph f), the overall activity of the fixed place of business, is of a **preparatory or auxiliary character**."

This means **all** activities in (a)-(e) must now satisfy the prep/aux test - the exemption is no longer automatic.

**Change 2: Anti-Fragmentation Rule - Article 5(4.1)**

A new paragraph prevents enterprises from fragmenting cohesive operations:

> Where the enterprise or a closely related enterprise carries on business activities at the same place or at another place in the same State, and:
> - That place or other place constitutes a PE, OR
> - The combination of the activities would not be preparatory or auxiliary

Then the exemption in 5(4) does not apply.

```
ANTI-FRAGMENTATION IN PRACTICE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BEFORE 2017:
Company A has in Country X:
  - Warehouse 1: "delivery" facility → No PE (Art 5(4)(a))
  - Warehouse 2: "storage" facility → No PE (Art 5(4)(a))
  - Office: "information collection" → No PE (Art 5(4)(d))

Combined = substantial distribution operation, but no PE

AFTER 2017:
Same facilities assessed as COMBINED operation:
  - Warehouse 1 + Warehouse 2 + Office
  - Overall character: Core distribution function
  - Conclusion: NOT preparatory/auxiliary → PE EXISTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 6.4 UN Model Difference: Delivery

The UN MDTC **omits "delivery"** from the exemptions in Article 5(4)(a) and (b). This means delivery activities may constitute a PE under the UN Model, reflecting developing country concerns about distribution operations escaping source taxation.

---

## 7. ARTICLE 5(5): AGENCY PE (DEPENDENT AGENT PE - "DAPE")

### 7.1 The Agency PE Concept

Even without a fixed place of business, an enterprise may have a PE through an agent acting on its behalf. This is the **Dependent Agent PE** or "DAPE" concept.

**Pre-2017 OECD MTC Article 5(5):**
> A person acting on behalf of an enterprise who has, and habitually exercises, authority to **conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise** shall be deemed to constitute a PE.

### 7.2 The Commissionaire Problem

A **commissionaire arrangement** is a civil law concept where:
- Agent (commissionaire) sells goods in their own name
- But on behalf of a principal (the foreign enterprise)
- Legal title passes from commissionaire to customer
- Beneficial ownership passes from principal to customer

**The problem**: Under pre-2017 rules, because contracts were "in the name of" the commissionaire (not the principal), no PE was created for the principal - even though the principal's goods were being sold in the source state.

**Key Cases:**
- **Zimmer (France, 2010)**: French Supreme Court held commissionaire arrangements did not create PE under pre-2017 rules
- **Dell (Norway, 2011)**: Norwegian court similarly found no PE

These cases confirmed the technical interpretation but also demonstrated the policy gap that BEPS Action 7 sought to address.

### 7.3 The 2017 Reform - Expanded Agency PE

**EXAM ALERT: December 2022 Q8 specifically tested commissionaire arrangements**

**OECD MTC 2017 Article 5(5):**
> A PE exists where a person acting on behalf of an enterprise habitually:
> - **(a)** Concludes contracts, or
> - **(b)** Habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification

And those contracts are either:
- In the name of the enterprise, OR
- For the transfer of ownership or granting of use of property, OR
- For the provision of services by the enterprise

```
EXPANDED AGENCY PE TEST (POST-2017)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OLD TEST (Pre-2017):
  Concludes contracts IN THE NAME OF the enterprise?
  └── If YES → PE
  └── If NO → No PE (commissionaire escape)

NEW TEST (Post-2017):
  1. Concludes contracts? (in any name) → PE
  OR
  2. Plays PRINCIPAL ROLE in leading to conclusion of contracts
     that are ROUTINELY CONCLUDED without material modification?
     └── If YES → PE

Effect: Commissionaire arrangements now typically create PE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 7.4 Key Concepts in New Article 5(5)

**"Habitually"**: Repeated actions, not isolated transactions

**"Principal role"**: The agent's involvement is the key factor in bringing about the contracts

**"Routinely concluded without material modification"**: The enterprise typically approves contracts negotiated by the agent without significant changes

**"Closely related enterprise"**: Defined in Article 5(8) post-2017 - more than 50% ownership or control

---

## 8. ARTICLE 5(6): INDEPENDENT AGENT EXCLUSION

### 8.1 The Rule

Article 5(6) provides that Article 5(5) does **not** apply to independent agents acting in the ordinary course of their business:

> "An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a PE merely because it carries on business through a broker, general commission agent or any other **agent of an independent status**, provided that such persons are acting in the **ordinary course of their business**."

### 8.2 The 2017 Narrowing

**OECD MTC 2017** added a crucial limitation:

> "However, where a person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one or more enterprises to which it is **closely related**, that person shall not be considered an independent agent."

This means:
- An agent who works exclusively for one principal (or related principals) cannot qualify as "independent"
- The "closely related" test uses 50% ownership/control threshold

### 8.3 Testing Independence

Factors indicating independence:
- Agent has multiple principals
- Agent bears entrepreneurial risk
- Agent has its own business premises and staff
- Agent is not subject to detailed instructions from principal
- Agent receives arm's length compensation

Factors indicating dependence:
- Exclusive or near-exclusive relationship with one principal
- Principal exercises significant control over agent's activities
- Agent does not bear commercial risk
- Agent follows detailed instructions

---

## 9. ARTICLE 5(7): PARENT-SUBSIDIARY PROVISION

### 9.1 The Rule

> "The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State... shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other."

### 9.2 Significance

This confirms that:
- A parent company does not have a PE merely because its subsidiary operates in another state
- A subsidiary is a separate legal entity, not automatically a PE of its parent
- **However**: A subsidiary *can* create a PE for its parent if it acts as a dependent agent under Article 5(5)

The key phrase is "of itself" - ownership/control alone doesn't create PE, but combined with other factors (agency relationship), it might.

---

## 10. UN MODEL DIFFERENCES

### 10.1 Service PE - Article 5(3)(b) UN MDTC

The UN Model includes a **Service PE** provision not found in the OECD Model:

> "The furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise for such purpose, but only if activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within a Contracting State for a period or periods aggregating more than **183 days** in any 12-month period."

**Key features:**
- No fixed place of business required
- Based on duration of activities in the state
- Aggregation of periods for same/connected projects
- 183-day threshold (some UN treaties use 6 months)

This is significant because it allows source states to tax service income even where the service provider has no physical office - addressing concerns about consultants and technical service providers operating without traditional PEs.

### 10.2 Summary: OECD vs UN Model on Article 5

| Feature | OECD MTC | UN MDTC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Construction PE threshold | 12 months | 6 months |
| Service PE | Not included | 183 days in 12 months |
| Delivery exemption | Included in 5(4) | **Excluded** |
| Insurance activities | Not specific PE | Deemed PE provision |
| Natural resources | General rules | Lower thresholds available |

### 10.3 Force of Attraction

The UN Model contains a limited "force of attraction" rule: once a PE exists, profits from similar business activities conducted in the source state (even without using the PE) may be attributed to the PE. The OECD Model does not include this.

---

## 11. 2025 OECD UPDATE: HOME OFFICE AND REMOTE WORK

### 11.1 New Guidance

The November 2025 update to the OECD MTC Commentary provides significant guidance on **home office PEs** - increasingly relevant post-pandemic:

**Key Thresholds:**

| Home Office Usage | PE Analysis |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **<50%** of working time | No PE - activity too intermittent |
| **≥50%** of working time | Case-by-case analysis required |

### 11.2 Factors for Analysis

Where home office use is ≥50%, the Commentary indicates consideration of:
- Whether there is a **commercial reason** for work from that state
- Whether the enterprise **required or induced** the home office use
- Whether the home is truly "at the disposal of" the enterprise
- The nature and significance of activities performed

### 11.3 Practical Implications

This guidance is relevant for:
- Remote workers operating across borders
- Digital nomads
- Post-pandemic flexible working arrangements
- Enterprises with distributed workforces

---

## 12. PROFIT ATTRIBUTION TO PES - LINK TO ARTICLE 7

### 12.1 The Authorised OECD Approach (AOA)

Once a PE exists, Article 7 governs profit attribution. The **Authorised OECD Approach** (2010 Report) requires:

1. **Functional analysis**: Identify functions performed, assets used, risks assumed by PE
2. **Arm's length pricing**: Price dealings between PE and head office as if separate enterprises
3. **Free capital attribution**: Attribute appropriate capital to PE

### 12.2 BEPS Action 7 Additional Guidance

The 2018 OECD report "Additional Guidance on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments under BEPS Action 7" addresses profit attribution for:
- Commissionaire arrangement PEs
- PEs arising from anti-fragmentation rules
- Service-related PEs

Key principle: The expanded PE definition means more PEs exist, but profit attribution should still reflect **actual functions performed** by personnel - not artificial profit allocation.

---

## 13. KEY CASES ON PE

| Case | Jurisdiction | Issue | Outcome |
|------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Zimmer** (2010) | France | Commissionaire arrangement | No PE under pre-2017 rules |
| **Dell** (2011) | Norway | Commissionaire arrangement | No PE under pre-2017 rules |
| **SmithKline Beecham** | Various | When premises "at disposal" | Fact-specific inquiry |
| **Philip Morris** (2002) | Australia | When subsidiary is agent | PE can arise through subsidiary |

## 14. EXAM APPLICATION FRAMEWORK

### 14.1 Systematic PE Analysis

```
PE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST FOR EXAM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHECK FOR FIXED PLACE PE (Art 5(1))
□ Is there a place of business?
□ Is it fixed (geographic and temporal)?
□ Is business carried on through it?
→ If YES to all three → Prima facie PE exists
→ Continue to Step 2

STEP 2: CHECK ARTICLE 5(2) EXAMPLES
□ Is it one of the listed places (office, branch, etc.)?
→ If YES → Confirms PE unless Step 3 applies

STEP 3: CHECK NEGATIVE LIST EXCLUSION (Art 5(4))
□ Is activity preparatory or auxiliary?
□ (Post-2017) Apply anti-fragmentation - assess combined activities
□ Consider OECD vs UN Model differences (delivery)
→ If prep/aux AND no fragmentation issue → No PE
→ Otherwise → PE exists

STEP 4: IF NO FIXED PLACE, CHECK AGENCY PE (Art 5(5))
□ Is there an agent acting on behalf of enterprise?
□ Does agent conclude contracts OR play principal role?
□ Is agent independent (Art 5(6)) or dependent?
□ (Post-2017) Does agent work exclusively for closely related enterprises?
→ If dependent agent → PE exists

STEP 5: CHECK CONSTRUCTION PE (Art 5(3))
□ Is there a building site or construction project?
□ Duration exceeds 12 months (OECD) or 6 months (UN)?
→ If threshold exceeded → PE exists

STEP 6: (UN MODEL) CHECK SERVICE PE
□ Services provided for >183 days in 12 months?
→ If YES under UN treaty → PE exists
