# Chapter 7.2: Key Definitional Provisions – Article 5: Permanent Establishment

## 1. The Significance of Permanent Establishment

### 1.1. Purpose and Function

The permanent establishment concept is among the most critical provisions in tax treaty law. It operates as the threshold for source State taxation of business profits. Under Article 7, business profits of an enterprise resident in one Contracting State are taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated there. Only then may the source State tax the profits attributable to that permanent establishment.

This threshold function creates significant consequences. Without a permanent establishment, a foreign enterprise may conduct substantial business activities in a country while remaining outside that country's taxing jurisdiction over business profits. The permanent establishment definition therefore represents a battleground between source States seeking to tax economic activity within their borders and enterprises seeking to minimise their tax footprint.

### 1.2. Relationship to Article 7

The permanent establishment concept and Article 7 operate together. Article 5 answers the threshold question: does a permanent establishment exist? Article 7 then addresses attribution: what profits are taxable by the source State? The existence of a permanent establishment opens the door to source State taxation, but the extent of that taxation depends on the profits properly attributable to the permanent establishment under Article 7's rules.

## 2. Article 5(1): The Basic Definition

### 2.1. The Three Cumulative Requirements

Article 5(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 provides: "For the purposes of this Convention, the term 'permanent establishment' means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on."

This definition contains three cumulative requirements. First, there must be a place of business—premises, facilities, installations, or equipment that the enterprise uses for its activities. Second, the place must be fixed, possessing both geographic specificity and temporal permanence. Third, the business of the enterprise must be carried on through that place, establishing a connection between the location and the enterprise's commercial activities.

### 2.2. Place of Business

The "place of business" requirement is interpreted broadly. Commentary paragraph 10 confirms that any premises, facilities, or installations may constitute a place of business, regardless of whether they are owned, rented, or otherwise at the enterprise's disposal. The place need not be used exclusively by the enterprise; shared facilities may qualify if the enterprise has sufficient access.

The "at disposal" concept is central to this analysis. The enterprise must have the location available for its business use. A hotel room used briefly by a visiting employee would not ordinarily satisfy this requirement, but an office space leased for the enterprise's ongoing use would. The question is whether the enterprise has a right to use the location for its business purposes.

### 2.3. Fixity Requirements

The "fixed" requirement has both geographic and temporal dimensions. Geographic fixity requires that the place of business be linked to a particular location—though this need not be a single building. A coherent commercial area, such as a mining site or construction zone, may satisfy the geographic requirement even if activities occur at various points within that area.

Temporal fixity requires sufficient permanence. Commentary paragraph 28 indicates that a period of six months typically suggests permanence, though shorter periods may qualify if the nature of the business is inherently short-term, if business activities recur at the same location, or if business is prematurely terminated. The assessment is fact-specific, focusing on whether the arrangement has the character of permanence rather than applying a mechanical time threshold.

### 2.4. Business Carried On Through the Place

The third requirement establishes a connection between the place and the enterprise's activities. The business must be "carried on through" that place, typically requiring personnel present at the location who perform the enterprise's commercial functions. A warehouse that merely stores goods without active business operations might not satisfy this requirement, whereas a warehouse where employees process orders and manage distribution clearly would.

## 3. Article 5(2): The Inclusive List

Article 5(2) provides a non-exhaustive list of examples that "especially" constitute permanent establishments: a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, and a mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or other place of extraction of natural resources.

These examples illustrate the permanent establishment concept but do not replace the basic definition. Each listed item must still satisfy the three requirements of Article 5(1). The list's function is clarificatory: if an arrangement falls within these categories and meets the basic definition, it constitutes a permanent establishment without further analysis.

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention 2021 extends this list to include farms, plantations, and warehouses used for providing storage facilities. These additions reflect developing country concerns about ensuring source State taxation of agricultural and logistics operations that might otherwise escape the permanent establishment threshold.

## 4. Article 5(3): Construction Permanent Establishment

### 4.1. The Duration Threshold

Article 5(3) addresses building sites and construction or installation projects. Under the OECD Model, such activities constitute a permanent establishment only if they last more than twelve months. The UN Model reduces this threshold to six months, reflecting source State interests in taxing construction income.

The twelve-month (or six-month) period runs from the commencement of preparatory work at the site until completion or permanent abandonment. Temporary interruptions do not stop the clock; a project paused for weather or materials delays continues to accumulate time toward the threshold.

### 4.2. Anti-Avoidance Aggregation

The Commentary addresses artificial fragmentation of construction projects. Where related projects at the same site would together exceed the threshold, they are aggregated for duration purposes. An enterprise cannot avoid permanent establishment status by splitting a single project into multiple sub-twelve-month contracts if the work is essentially a coherent undertaking.

This aggregation principle has become increasingly important as tax authorities scrutinise arrangements designed to keep individual contracts just below the threshold while the combined activity represents substantial, continuous construction presence.

## 5. Article 5(4): Preparatory and Auxiliary Exclusions

### 5.1. The Exclusions Listed

Article 5(4) provides that certain activities do not constitute a permanent establishment despite satisfying the basic definition. The excluded activities include: use of facilities solely for storage, display, or delivery of goods belonging to the enterprise; maintenance of stock of goods solely for storage, display, or processing by another enterprise; maintenance of a fixed place solely for purchasing goods or collecting information; and maintenance of a fixed place solely for any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

### 5.2. The 2017 Reforms

BEPS Action 7 fundamentally reformed Article 5(4). Prior to 2017, the exclusions in subparagraphs (a) through (d) were automatic—the listed activities were deemed preparatory or auxiliary without further analysis. This allowed enterprises to maintain substantial distribution warehouses or purchasing operations while claiming the exclusions applied automatically.

The 2017 revision requires that all listed activities satisfy the preparatory or auxiliary character test. The exclusions are no longer automatic; a large-scale distribution warehouse might fail the test even though "delivery" is listed in subparagraph (a), because its overall character is not preparatory or auxiliary to the enterprise's core business.

### 5.3. The Anti-Fragmentation Rule

Article 5(4.1), added in 2017, introduces an anti-fragmentation rule. Where an enterprise or a closely related enterprise carries on activities at the same place or at different places in the same State, and either the combination constitutes a permanent establishment or the combined activities are not preparatory or auxiliary, the exclusions do not apply.

This rule prevents enterprises from fragmenting coherent business operations among multiple locations or related entities, with each fragment claiming a separate exclusion. A distribution operation divided between a storage warehouse, a delivery depot, and an information-gathering office might previously have claimed three separate exclusions; under the anti-fragmentation rule, these activities are assessed together.

Implementation of the anti-fragmentation rule through the Multilateral Instrument has been uneven. Approximately 94 jurisdictions have signed the MLI, potentially affecting over 1,500 treaties. However, only some jurisdictions have opted into the anti-fragmentation provisions, with approximately 525 treaties potentially implementing the rule. The United Kingdom, notably, has not adopted the requirement that all subparagraph activities satisfy the preparatory or auxiliary test, treating subparagraphs (a) through (d) as per se exemptions.

## 6. Article 5(5): Agency Permanent Establishment

### 6.1. The Pre-2017 Position

Before the 2017 reforms, Article 5(5) provided that an enterprise had a permanent establishment if a person acting on its behalf habitually exercised authority to conclude contracts "in the name of the enterprise." This language created an escape route through commissionaire arrangements—civil law structures where an agent sells goods in their own name but on behalf of a principal. Because contracts were concluded "in the name of" the commissionaire rather than the principal, no permanent establishment arose.

The French Zimmer case (2010) and Norwegian Dell case (2011) confirmed this interpretation, finding that commissionaire arrangements did not create permanent establishments under the pre-2017 rules. These decisions demonstrated both the technical accuracy of the interpretation and the policy gap that BEPS Action 7 addressed.

### 6.2. The Expanded Agency Test

The 2017 revision significantly expanded the agency permanent establishment concept. Article 5(5) now provides that an enterprise has a permanent establishment where a person acting on its behalf habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification.

The "principal role" language specifically targets commissionaire arrangements. Even where contracts are formally concluded in the agent's name, if the agent plays the principal role in bringing about contracts that the enterprise routinely approves, a permanent establishment exists. The focus shifts from formal contract conclusion to substantive involvement in the contracting process.

### 6.3. Key Interpretive Concepts

Several concepts in the revised provision require interpretation. "Habitually" indicates repeated activity rather than isolated transactions. "Principal role" means the agent's involvement is the decisive factor in bringing about contracts. "Routinely concluded without material modification" indicates that the enterprise typically approves contracts negotiated by the agent without significant changes.

The "closely related enterprise" concept, defined in Article 5(8), applies a more-than-50-percent ownership or control threshold. This definition matters for both the anti-fragmentation rule and the independent agent exception.

## 7. Article 5(6): Independent Agent Exception

Article 5(6) provides that an enterprise does not have a permanent establishment merely because it carries on business through an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of their business. True independent agents—brokers, general commission agents, and similar intermediaries—do not create permanent establishments for their principals.

The 2017 reforms narrowed this exception. An agent who acts exclusively or almost exclusively for closely related enterprises cannot qualify as independent. This prevents enterprises from claiming the independent agent exception for captive intermediaries whose sole or primary function is serving the enterprise group.

Factors indicating independence include representation of multiple principals, assumption of entrepreneurial risk, maintenance of separate business premises and staff, freedom from detailed instructions, and arm's length compensation. Factors indicating dependence include exclusive relationships, principal control over activities, absence of commercial risk, and detailed instruction requirements.

## 8. UN Model Differences

### 8.1. Service Permanent Establishment

The UN Model includes a service permanent establishment provision not found in the OECD Model. Article 5(3)(b) provides that furnishing of services, including consultancy services, through employees or other personnel constitutes a permanent establishment if activities continue for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period.

This provision addresses developing country concerns about service providers operating without fixed places of business. A consultant who works on-site at a client's premises for extended periods may create a permanent establishment for their employer even without the employer having any fixed location in the country.

### 8.2. Construction Threshold

The UN Model's six-month construction threshold (versus the OECD's twelve months) reflects source State interests in capturing revenue from shorter-term projects. Many developing countries rely significantly on foreign construction enterprises for infrastructure development; the lower threshold ensures these activities generate taxable presence more readily.

### 8.3. Delivery Exclusion

The UN Model omits "delivery" from the preparatory or auxiliary exclusions. Under the OECD Model, delivery of goods belonging to the enterprise may be excluded from permanent establishment status; under the UN Model, delivery activities may constitute a permanent establishment. This difference reflects source State interests in taxing distribution operations.

### 8.4. Article 5A: Natural Resources

The UN's 2025 updates introduced Article 5A, establishing a 30-day threshold for extractive and renewable resource activities. This provision ensures source States capture taxing rights over resource extraction even for short-term operations, reflecting the importance of natural resources in developing country economies.

## 9. The 2025 OECD Update: Home Office Guidance

### 9.1. The Remote Work Challenge

The November 2025 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention Commentary provides significant guidance on home office permanent establishments. The increase in remote and hybrid work arrangements following the pandemic created uncertainty about when employees working from home might create permanent establishments for their employers.

### 9.2. The 50% Working Time Threshold

The 2025 Commentary introduces a quantitative indicator: if an employee works from a home or other location for less than 50% of their total working time over a twelve-month period, that location generally would not constitute a place of business. This threshold provides a practical safe harbour for enterprises with employees who occasionally work remotely.

However, exceeding the 50% threshold does not automatically create a permanent establishment. Rather, it triggers a more detailed analysis of the circumstances.

### 9.3. The Commercial Reason Test

Where home office use exceeds 50% of working time, the Commentary requires assessment of whether the enterprise has a commercial reason for the employee's presence in that location. Commercial reasons include direct engagement with local customers or suppliers, access to State-specific resources or expertise, and substitution for premises the enterprise would otherwise rent.

Importantly, cost reduction alone does not constitute a commercial reason. An enterprise that allows remote work simply to reduce office space costs lacks a commercial reason for the employee's presence in the relevant jurisdiction. The commercial reason must relate to the enterprise's business operations, not merely to operational efficiencies.

### 9.4. Preparatory or Auxiliary Character

Even where a home office might otherwise constitute a permanent establishment, the preparatory or auxiliary exception may apply. Internal administrative functions such as accounting, human resources, or secretarial duties commonly satisfy the exception. The 2025 Commentary acknowledges that home office activities frequently fall within this category.

## 10. Profit Attribution

Once a permanent establishment exists, Article 7 governs profit attribution. The Authorised OECD Approach, developed through the 2010 Report on Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments, requires functional analysis of activities performed, assets used, and risks assumed by the permanent establishment. Transactions between the permanent establishment and its head office are priced at arm's length as if they were dealings between separate enterprises.

BEPS Action 7's additional guidance, published in 2018, addresses profit attribution for permanent establishments arising from commissionaire arrangements, anti-fragmentation, and service activities. The key principle is that expanded permanent establishment definitions do not justify expanded profit attribution; attribution should still reflect actual functions performed by personnel rather than artificial allocation.

## 11. Recent Case Law Developments

### 11.1. Italian Decisions

Italian courts have produced significant permanent establishment jurisprudence in recent years. In Judgment No. 2911/2024, the Italian Supreme Court confirmed that either a fixed place permanent establishment or an agency permanent establishment suffices—both need not be present simultaneously. The Court emphasised substantive over formal analysis in Judgment No. 992/2024, looking beyond contractual structures to actual business operations.

### 11.2. Indian Developments

Indian courts have actively addressed permanent establishment issues. In Progress Rail Locomotive Inc. v. DCIT (2024), the Delhi High Court held that for an agency permanent establishment to exist, the authority to conclude contracts must be actually exercised, not merely formally conferred. In CIT v. ESPN Star Sports Mauritius (2024), the Court found that an Indian company providing support services to enable a foreign company to serve overseas clients did not create a permanent establishment for the foreign company.

The Delhi High Court's decision in Hyatt International (2024) addressed profit attribution, holding that an Indian permanent establishment may be taxable even where the non-resident enterprise is loss-making globally. This substantive approach focuses on the permanent establishment's own profitability rather than consolidated group results.

## 12. Discussion and Contemporary Issues

The permanent establishment concept continues to evolve under pressure from changing business models and policy concerns. The 2017 reforms addressed commissionaire arrangements and fragmentation strategies that had undermined source State taxation, but questions remain about whether the revised rules strike the right balance between certainty and anti-avoidance.

The 2025 home office guidance responds to practical realities of remote work but creates new compliance challenges. Enterprises must now track employee working patterns across jurisdictions, assess commercial reasons for remote arrangements, and monitor cumulative time thresholds. The guidance provides welcome clarity but also imposes administrative burdens.

The divergence between OECD and UN approaches reflects continuing tensions between residence and source State interests. Developing countries favour lower thresholds and broader permanent establishment definitions to capture taxing rights over economic activity within their territories. The UN's new Article 5A on natural resources exemplifies this orientation, ensuring source State taxation of extractive activities that might escape traditional permanent establishment analysis.

Academic commentary has questioned whether the permanent establishment concept remains fit for purpose in the digital economy, where enterprises can generate substantial revenue in jurisdictions without physical presence. Pillar One of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework represents one response to this challenge, proposing new taxing rights based on market presence rather than physical establishment. The relationship between traditional permanent establishment rules and emerging nexus concepts will shape international taxation for years to come.
