## Chapter 18.2: The MLI Explanatory Statement

### 1. Introduction and Purpose

#### 1.1. Origins and Adoption

The Explanatory Statement to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS was adopted by the Ad Hoc Group on 24 November 2016, the same day the MLI text itself was adopted. This simultaneous adoption was deliberate—the Explanatory Statement was developed alongside the Convention text through the same negotiating process involving over 100 countries and jurisdictions. The document was adopted in both English and French, reflecting the practice for international tax instruments.

The Explanatory Statement represents the collective understanding of the negotiators regarding the Convention's operation. Unlike an optional commentary or interpretive guidance issued subsequently, the Explanatory Statement emerged directly from the drafting process and reflects positions agreed among the participating jurisdictions during the negotiations conducted under the mandate delivered by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in February 2015.

#### 1.2. Purpose of the Explanatory Statement

The Explanatory Statement serves a specific and carefully delimited purpose: it clarifies the operation of the Convention to modify Covered Tax Agreements (CTAs). The document describes the types of treaty provisions intended to be covered by each MLI article and explains the ways in which those provisions are intended to be modified.

Critically, the Explanatory Statement is not intended to address the interpretation of the underlying BEPS measures themselves. The substantive policy content of Articles 3 through 17—implementing BEPS Actions 2, 6, 7, and 14—should be interpreted by reference to the BEPS Final Reports and the OECD Commentary. The Explanatory Statement addresses how these measures operate through the MLI to modify existing treaties, not what the measures themselves mean.

The sole exception concerns Part VI (Articles 18-26), addressing mandatory binding arbitration. Because the arbitration provisions were developed specifically for the MLI rather than derived from prior BEPS work, the Explanatory Statement provides both operational guidance and substantive interpretation for these articles.

#### 1.3. Relationship to the MLI Text

The Explanatory Statement operates as a companion document to the MLI text rather than an integral part of it. The MLI itself is the legally binding instrument; the Explanatory Statement provides authoritative guidance on its interpretation and application. This relationship mirrors the relationship between bilateral tax treaties and the OECD Commentary—the Commentary is not part of the treaty text but provides crucial interpretive guidance.

Understanding this relationship is essential for practitioners. When questions arise about how the MLI affects a particular bilateral treaty, the first reference is the MLI text itself, including the reservations and notifications of both parties. The Explanatory Statement then provides guidance on how that text should be understood and applied.

### 2. Legal Status and Interpretation

#### 2.1. Vienna Convention Framework

The legal status of the Explanatory Statement must be understood through the framework established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT establish the hierarchy of interpretive materials for treaties.

Article 31 provides the general rule of interpretation: treaties shall be interpreted "in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose." The "context" for this purpose includes the treaty text, its preamble and annexes, and any agreement relating to the treaty made between all parties in connection with its conclusion.

Article 32 addresses supplementary means of interpretation, including "the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion." Recourse to supplementary means is permitted to confirm meanings derived from Article 31 analysis or to resolve ambiguity, obscurity, or manifestly absurd results.

#### 2.2. Context vs Supplementary Means

The classification of the Explanatory Statement—as context under Article 31(2) or supplementary means under Article 32—has generated academic debate. The practical significance lies in whether the Explanatory Statement must be considered in every interpretive exercise (context) or only where the ordinary meaning is unclear (supplementary means).

The stronger view holds that the Explanatory Statement forms part of the context under Article 31(2)(a). The simultaneous adoption of the Explanatory Statement and the MLI by the Ad Hoc Group, representing all negotiating parties, satisfies the requirement of "an agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty." The negotiators clearly intended the Explanatory Statement to accompany and inform the interpretation of the MLI.

Even if classified as supplementary means under Article 32, the Explanatory Statement would retain significant interpretive weight. As the authoritative record of negotiator intent, it would be the primary supplementary source consulted where MLI provisions require clarification. The practical difference between the two classifications may be less significant than the theoretical distinction suggests.

#### 2.3. Relationship to OECD Commentary

The Explanatory Statement exists alongside, rather than replacing, the OECD Commentary on the Model Tax Convention. For Articles 3 through 17, the OECD Commentary developed during the BEPS Project—and reflected in the 2017 Model Tax Convention updates—provides the primary interpretive guidance for the substantive content of MLI provisions.

The Explanatory Statement addresses how MLI provisions operate to modify CTAs; the OECD Commentary addresses what those provisions mean. For example, the Explanatory Statement explains how Article 7's principal purpose test modifies existing treaties through compatibility clauses and notifications. The OECD Commentary on Article 29 of the 2017 Model explains how the principal purpose test itself should be applied to specific fact patterns.

This division reflects the Explanatory Statement's explicit limitation: it clarifies operation, not substance. The May 2021 Conference of the Parties opinion confirmed this relationship, stating that "the Commentary developed during the course of the BEPS project and reflected in the OECD Model Convention 2017 has particular relevance" for interpreting MLI provisions.

### 3. Structure and Content

#### 3.1. General Provisions (Paragraphs 1-20)

The Explanatory Statement opens with general provisions establishing the framework for understanding the MLI's operation. These introductory paragraphs address fundamental concepts that apply throughout the Convention.

Paragraphs 1-6 establish context, explaining the BEPS mandate and the objective of implementing treaty-related BEPS measures "swiftly" across the bilateral treaty network. Paragraph 6 specifically identifies the MLI's purpose as rapid implementation—a purpose relevant to resolving interpretive questions in favour of effectiveness.

Paragraphs 7-12 address the relationship between the MLI and existing CTAs. The Explanatory Statement confirms that the MLI "applies alongside" existing treaties, modifying their operation without directly amending their text. This reflects the lex posterior principle codified in Article 30(3) of the VCLT—the later treaty (the MLI) prevails over earlier treaties (the CTAs) to the extent of any incompatibility.

Paragraphs 13-18 contain crucial guidance on the compatibility clause architecture. These paragraphs explain the four types of compatibility clauses and how notifications trigger MLI application. This section is essential for determining whether any given MLI provision modifies a particular CTA.

Paragraphs 19-20 address Part VI specifically, noting that unlike other parts, the Explanatory Statement provides both operational and substantive guidance for the arbitration provisions.

#### 3.2. Part-by-Part Guidance

Following the general provisions, the Explanatory Statement provides article-by-article guidance organized by MLI Parts:

**Part II (Hybrid Mismatches)** guidance explains how Articles 3-5 address fiscally transparent entities, dual resident entities, and methods for eliminating double taxation. The Explanatory Statement identifies the types of existing treaty provisions these articles are intended to modify.

**Part III (Treaty Abuse)** guidance addresses Articles 6-11. Particular attention is given to Article 7's options for satisfying the minimum standard—the PPT alone, simplified LOB with anti-conduit rules, or detailed LOB provisions. The Explanatory Statement explains how jurisdictions may combine these approaches.

**Part IV (Permanent Establishment)** guidance explains the optional nature of Articles 12-15 and how they interact with existing PE definitions. The commissionnaire arrangements provision and specific activity exemptions receive detailed treatment.

**Part V (Dispute Resolution)** guidance addresses the MAP improvements under Article 16 and corresponding adjustments under Article 17. These provisions implement the Action 14 minimum standard.

**Part VI (Arbitration)** receives the most extensive treatment, with the Explanatory Statement providing both operational guidance and substantive interpretation for the arbitration framework. *(covered in June 2024)*

**Part VII (Final Provisions)** guidance addresses reservations, notifications, entry into force, and entry into effect—the procedural architecture enabling the MLI to function.

#### 3.3. Compatibility Clause Explanations

The Explanatory Statement's treatment of compatibility clauses in paragraphs 13-18 merits particular attention, as these clauses determine when and how MLI provisions modify CTAs.

**Four formulations** exist:

*"In place of"* provisions replace existing CTA provisions addressing the same subject matter. If no existing provision exists, the MLI provision does not apply. Both parties must notify the existence of such provisions for the MLI to take effect.

*"Applies to" or "modifies"* provisions change the application of existing CTA provisions without replacing them. The MLI provision supplements or adjusts the existing provision.

*"In the absence of"* provisions apply only where no existing provision addresses the subject matter. If an existing provision exists, the MLI provision does not apply.

*"In place of or in the absence of"* provisions apply regardless of whether existing provisions exist—replacing them if present, applying independently if absent. This formulation provides the broadest application.

The Explanatory Statement emphasizes that notification requirements exist to ensure "clarity and transparency about the application of the MLI." Where required notifications are not made, articles generally do not modify CTAs—with exceptions for the fourth formulation above.

### 4. Key Interpretive Guidance

#### 4.1. The Four Compatibility Clause Types in Practice

Understanding the four compatibility clause types requires attention to how they operate in practice. Each MLI article contains one formulation, determining its relationship with existing treaty provisions.

The "in place of" formulation appears in provisions addressing subjects where existing treaties may or may not contain relevant provisions. Article 4 (dual resident entities) provides an example—some treaties contain place of effective management tie-breakers that Article 4 replaces, while others resolve dual residence differently.

The "applies to" formulation appears where the MLI modifies existing provisions without entirely replacing them. Article 8's 365-day holding period for dividends applies to existing dividend articles, adding a condition without replacing the substantive allocation rules.

The "in the absence of" formulation appears where the MLI provides default rules for treaties lacking coverage. This formulation is relatively rare, as most MLI provisions address subjects commonly found in existing treaties.

The "in place of or in the absence of" formulation appears for provisions the negotiators intended to apply universally. Article 6's preamble modification and Article 7's principal purpose test use this formulation, ensuring application regardless of existing treaty language.

#### 4.2. Notification Requirements

The Explanatory Statement devotes considerable attention to notification requirements, recognizing their critical role in MLI operation. Notifications serve multiple functions: identifying CTAs covered, specifying existing provisions within compatibility clause scope, and communicating choices among options.

Paragraph 18 addresses the consequences of notification failures. Generally, absent required notifications, MLI provisions do not modify CTAs. However, the Explanatory Statement notes that "in place of or in the absence of" provisions apply regardless of notification, reflecting their universal application design.

The Explanatory Statement encourages jurisdictions to address notification discrepancies before finalizing their positions. Provisional notifications are required at signature, permitting discussion and correction before ratification. Where disagreements persist about whether provisions fall within compatibility clause scope, the mutual agreement procedure or Conference of the Parties processes may be invoked.

#### 4.3. Reservation Mechanisms

The Explanatory Statement explains the reservation architecture enabling jurisdictional flexibility. Unlike most multilateral conventions permitting only specifically authorized reservations, the MLI contains extensive reservation options reflecting the diversity of existing treaty positions.

The Explanatory Statement distinguishes between provisions that permit no reservations (minimum standards), provisions that permit complete reservation, and provisions offering intermediate choices. This architecture enables jurisdictions to calibrate their MLI positions to their existing treaty policies while ensuring minimum standard implementation.

The principle of reciprocity governs reservation effects. Where one party reserves against a provision, that provision does not modify the CTA in either direction. This symmetric operation respects the bilateral nature of the underlying treaty relationships.

### 5. Conference of the Parties Opinions

#### 5.1. Role of the COP

Article 31(3) of the MLI establishes the Conference of the Parties (COP) as the body responsible for addressing questions regarding MLI interpretation and implementation. The COP may issue opinions providing authoritative guidance on interpretive questions arising in practice.

The COP operates by consensus of the Parties. Its opinions, while not legally binding in the same manner as the MLI text itself, carry substantial interpretive weight as expressions of collective Party understanding. The opinions supplement the Explanatory Statement by addressing questions that have emerged during implementation.

#### 5.2. The Six Guiding Principles (May 2021)

On 3 May 2021, the COP approved an opinion establishing six guiding principles for MLI interpretation and implementation. This foundational opinion addresses questions at the highest level of generality, providing a framework for resolving specific issues.

**Principle One** confirms that the MLI should be interpreted in light of its object and purpose—implementing treaty-related BEPS measures. Each provision should be interpreted to advance the relevant BEPS policy objective.

**Principle Two** addresses the relationship with BEPS materials. The Commentary developed during the BEPS Project has "particular relevance" for interpreting MLI provisions, and the Explanatory Statement "forms part of the context" for interpretation.

**Principle Three** establishes the later-in-time rule (lex posterior). The MLI prevails over CTAs to the extent of incompatibility, following Article 30(3) of the VCLT.

**Principle Four** addresses jurisdictional consent. The MLI does not modify a CTA beyond the boundaries set by either party's MLI Position. Reservations and notifications define the scope of each party's consent.

**Principle Five** addresses resolution procedures. Questions about CTA provisions as modified by the MLI should be resolved through the CTA's mutual agreement procedure. Questions about the MLI itself may be addressed by the COP.

**Principle Six** addresses the role of COP opinions. Opinions may provide guidance on interpretation and implementation, supplementing the Explanatory Statement.

#### 5.3. Subsequent Opinions

Following the foundational May 2021 opinion, the COP has issued additional opinions addressing specific implementation questions:

The **March 2021 opinion on Article 35(1)(a)** addresses entry into effect for withholding taxes, clarifying that the MLI can take effect on the same date as entry into force.

The **September 2021 opinion on Article 16** addresses MAP implementation, confirming that improved MAP access applies to cases presented after the MLI takes effect, regardless of the taxable periods to which cases relate.

The **September 2021 opinion on Part VI** addresses arbitration entry into effect, providing guidance on when arbitration becomes available for unresolved MAP cases.

These opinions demonstrate the COP's ongoing role in addressing implementation questions as they arise, supplementing the original Explanatory Statement with guidance responsive to practical experience. *(covered in December 2023)*

### 6. Practical Application

#### 6.1. Using the Explanatory Statement

Practitioners using the Explanatory Statement should approach it methodically. For any question about how the MLI affects a CTA, the analysis proceeds in stages.

First, identify whether both parties have listed the CTA as covered and have ratified the MLI. The Explanatory Statement applies only to relationships where the MLI takes effect.

Second, identify the relevant MLI article and its compatibility clause formulation. The Explanatory Statement's general provisions (paragraphs 13-18) explain how each formulation operates.

Third, consult the article-specific guidance in the Explanatory Statement to understand the types of existing provisions addressed and the intended modification effects.

Fourth, verify that required notifications have been made by both parties. The OECD's MLI Database provides current notification information.

Fifth, where substantive interpretation of the provision itself is required, consult the relevant OECD Commentary rather than the Explanatory Statement.

#### 6.2. Resolving Interpretation Questions

The Explanatory Statement provides a framework for resolving interpretation questions but does not answer all questions definitively. Where questions arise about CTA provisions as modified by the MLI, the mutual agreement procedure provides the primary resolution mechanism.

Where questions arise about the MLI itself—rather than modified CTA provisions—the COP process may address them. Article 31(3) permits any Party to request a COP meeting to consider interpretation or implementation questions. COP opinions provide authoritative guidance that supplements the Explanatory Statement.

Practitioners should monitor COP opinions for developments affecting their analysis. The OECD publishes opinions as they are adopted, and these opinions may clarify or develop positions beyond the original Explanatory Statement.

#### 6.3. Relationship with Synthesized Texts

The OECD publishes synthesized texts showing how the MLI modifies specific bilateral treaties. These texts consolidate the MLI provisions, reservations, notifications, and existing treaty provisions into unified documents showing the treaty as modified.

The Explanatory Statement informs the development of synthesized texts by explaining how MLI provisions interact with existing provisions. However, synthesized texts are not themselves authoritative—they reflect the OECD's analysis of how the MLI applies rather than agreed Party positions. Where synthesized texts and Party positions diverge, the underlying MLI Positions (reservations and notifications) and the CTA text control.

Practitioners should use synthesized texts as starting points for analysis, verified against the Explanatory Statement guidance and Party positions. The synthesized texts simplify analysis but do not substitute for understanding the underlying framework the Explanatory Statement explains.
