|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Introduction Para 29 | Commentaries not legally binding but "of great assistance" | Foundation for legal status analysis |

| Source taxation | Residence-biased | More source state rights | Different perspective affects interpretation |
| Articles 12A, 12B | Not covered | Extensive Commentary on FTS, ADS | UN Commentary primary for these |
| Developing countries | Limited focus | Explicit developing country guidance | UN Commentary addresses capital-importing state concerns |
| Update frequency | Regular (2017, 2025) | Less frequent (2021) | OECD more current |

## COMMENTARY ANALYSIS

### OECD Commentary - Introduction Paragraphs

| Paragraph | Key Guidance | Exam Relevance |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Para 29 | "Although the Commentaries are not designed to be annexed in any manner to the conventions... they can nevertheless be of great assistance in the application and interpretation" | Legal status foundation |
| Para 30 | Member countries may file Observations indicating "the way in which those countries will apply the provisions" | Observations limit Commentary applicability |
| Para 31 | Reservations signal intent to deviate from Model text | Distinguish from Observations |
| Para 33-34 | Commentary generally represents agreement on principles; changes reflect OECD consensus | OECD's ambulatory position |
| Para 35 | "Changes or additions to the Commentaries are normally applicable to the interpretation and application of conventions concluded before their adoption" | Key ambulatory statement |
| Para 36-36.1 | Ambulatory approach inappropriate where changes have "changed the conclusions" rather than clarifying | Qualification on ambulatory approach |

### Reservations and Observations (2017 OECD Model)

| Category | Count | Key Articles |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Total Reservations | 226 | Across all articles |
| Art 5 Reservations | 29 | Highest concentration |
| Art 10 Reservations | 22 | Dividend definition variations |
| Art 13 Reservations | 20 | Capital gains differences |
| Art 26-28 Reservations | 0 | None |

### UN Commentary Differences

- UN Commentary explicitly references OECD Commentary where provisions align
- Additional guidance on Articles 12A (Fees for Technical Services) and 12B (Automated Digital Services)
- More source-state focused interpretation
- Developing country perspectives explicitly addressed

## INTEGRATION WITH TOPIC RESEARCH

### Confirms
- Legal status as non-binding but persuasive (Commerzbank principle)
- Classification under Article 32 VCLT as supplementary means (Thiel)
- Static vs ambulatory debate is fundamental controversy
- Reservations/Observations limit applicability (Alta Energy)

### Adds
- 2025 OECD Update addresses remote working, natural resources, Article 9
- German BFH 2023 decision reinforces static approach
- Spain 2020 decision adds to static approach jurisdictions
- Netherlands case pending for principled decision
- Detailed paragraph references for OECD Introduction (29-36.1)

### Clarifies
- OECD advocates ambulatory approach (para 35) but with qualification (para 36)
- Distinction between Reservations (Article text), Observations (Commentary), Positions (non-OECD)
- 226 total reservations in 2017 Model with distribution by article
- UN Commentary relationship - references OECD but covers different articles
