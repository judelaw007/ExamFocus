# Chapter 19.2: VAT/GST Issues in the Digital Economy

## 1. Introduction and OECD Framework

### 1.1. The Consumption Tax Challenge

Value-added tax and goods and services tax systems face distinctive challenges in the digital economy. Traditional VAT mechanisms assume physical presence of suppliers, tangible goods crossing borders, and identifiable consumption locations. Digital services—delivered instantaneously across borders without physical infrastructure—undermine each of these assumptions.

The OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines, published in 2017, established internationally agreed standards for consistent VAT application to cross-border digital trade. These Guidelines represent consensus among over one hundred jurisdictions and provide the authoritative framework for digital economy consumption taxation. By 2024, 101 countries had implemented VAT/GST on cross-border online sales, with over fifty countries adopting OECD recommendations for collection mechanisms (covered in December 2024).

### 1.2. Core Principles

The Guidelines establish several foundational principles. Neutrality requires that VAT systems should not create unintended economic distortions between different supply chains or business structures—domestic and foreign suppliers should compete on equal terms. Efficiency demands that compliance costs for businesses and administrative costs for tax authorities should be minimised while maintaining effective collection. Certainty and simplicity ensure that VAT rules are clear and simple to understand, enabling businesses to anticipate tax consequences.

## 2. Destination Principle and Place of Supply

### 2.1. The Destination Principle

The destination principle provides that VAT should be levied in the jurisdiction where consumption occurs, not where the supplier is located. For cross-border digital services, this means taxation in the customer's jurisdiction regardless of where the service provider is established. This principle ensures that consumption taxation falls where value is ultimately consumed, preventing both double taxation and unintended non-taxation.

Application of the destination principle requires determining customer location—a significant challenge for digital services. The Guidelines recognise multiple proxy indicators including IP addresses (though unreliable due to VPN usage), billing addresses, bank account locations, and customer declarations. For business customers, the location of the business establishment using the service generally determines the place of supply. For consumers, the usual residence or habitual location applies.

### 2.2. B2B vs B2C Distinctions

The Guidelines distinguish between business-to-business and business-to-consumer supplies, recommending different collection mechanisms for each.

For B2B supplies, the reverse charge mechanism shifts VAT accounting responsibility from the foreign supplier to the domestic business customer. The customer self-assesses and declares VAT on the supply, then claims input tax credit if entitled. This eliminates the need for foreign suppliers to register in every jurisdiction where they have business customers—a significant compliance simplification.

For B2C supplies, reverse charge is impractical because private consumers cannot self-assess VAT. The Guidelines therefore recommend that foreign suppliers register and account for VAT under simplified registration regimes, even without physical presence in the customer's jurisdiction.

## 3. Collection Mechanisms

### 3.1. Vendor Registration Models

Most jurisdictions follow the non-resident vendor collection model, requiring foreign digital service suppliers to register for VAT above specified turnover thresholds. Registration thresholds vary significantly: Singapore requires S$100,000 annual B2C turnover (with S$1 million global turnover), Australia requires A$75,000, New Zealand requires NZ$60,000, and the EU applies €10,000 for One-Stop-Shop eligibility.

Registered suppliers must collect VAT at the applicable rate at point of sale, file periodic returns in the consumption jurisdiction, and remit collected tax to local authorities. This vendor collection model operates worldwide but creates compliance complexity for suppliers operating across multiple jurisdictions with different rates, thresholds, and filing requirements.

### 3.2. Simplified Registration Schemes

To reduce compliance burden, jurisdictions have developed simplified registration mechanisms. The European Union's One-Stop-Shop, introduced in July 2021, allows suppliers to file a single quarterly return in one member state covering all EU B2C sales. This replaced the earlier Mini-One-Stop-Shop (MOSS) that applied only to digital services. Non-EU businesses can use the Non-Union OSS scheme, eliminating requirements to register separately in each member state.

The Import One-Stop-Shop (IOSS) addresses low-value imported goods valued at €150 or less. IOSS requires monthly filing—more frequent than quarterly OSS—but exempts goods from import VAT at the border when IOSS registration is maintained. Both EU and non-EU sellers can access IOSS.

### 3.3. Platform Deemed Supplier Rules

Recent developments increasingly impose deemed supplier liability on marketplace operators. Rather than requiring individual sellers to register and collect VAT, jurisdictions designate platforms as responsible for VAT on transactions conducted through their systems (covered in December 2023).

The EU VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) package, adopted on 11 March 2025, extends deemed supplier rules to platforms facilitating short-term rentals and passenger transport services. Platforms become liable for VAT unless the underlying supplier provides a valid VAT number and accepts liability. Implementation phases through January 2035.

Singapore requires electronic marketplace operators to register and account for GST on remote services and low-value goods supplied through their platforms. New Zealand implemented platform collection requirements from April 2024 for accommodation, ride-sharing, and food delivery services. Japan has implemented full platform liability. These developments recognise that platforms control transaction flows and possess customer information enabling effective compliance (covered in June 2024).

## 4. Low-Value Imported Goods

### 4.1. De Minimis Threshold Elimination

Traditional customs systems exempted low-value imported goods from VAT and duties below specified thresholds—typically reflecting the administrative cost of collection exceeding revenue generated. Digital commerce dramatically increased low-value parcel volumes, eroding tax bases and creating competitive disadvantages for domestic retailers subject to full VAT.

Australia eliminated GST exemptions for goods valued at A$1,000 or less from July 2018. Foreign businesses with A$75,000 or more in Australian turnover must register and collect ten percent GST at point of sale. The single threshold consolidates digital services and physical goods, simplifying compliance requirements.

The EU's IOSS scheme, effective July 2021, covers goods valued at €150 or less. Goods exceeding €150 but below €1,000 face different treatment, while goods exceeding €1,000 remain subject to import VAT and duties at the border.

New Zealand implemented its "Netflix Tax" in October 2016, applying fifteen percent GST to low-value goods below NZ$1,000 per shipment. Unregistered suppliers receive an 8.5 percent flat-rate credit approximating input tax deductions, effectively collecting 6.5 percent net.

## 5. Key Jurisdictional Approaches

### 5.1. European Union

The EU pioneered digital services VAT through the 2015 destination principle implementation and MOSS scheme. The 2021 OSS reforms merged goods and services taxation into a single framework with quarterly filing. The 2025 ViDA package represents the most comprehensive platform economy reform to date, extending deemed supplier liability and implementing automatic verification mechanisms through European tax databases.

EU VAT rates vary by member state from fifteen to twenty-seven percent. The €10,000 threshold applies only to EU-registered businesses; non-EU businesses must register OSS regardless of turnover.

### 5.2. United Kingdom Post-Brexit

Following Brexit, UK businesses selling to EU consumers must use EU schemes (Non-Union OSS or direct member state registration). The UK MOSS scheme was withdrawn on 1 January 2021. Northern Ireland remains within the EU single market for goods under the Windsor Framework, enabling access to IOSS from March 2024.

The UK maintains its separate VAT system with twenty percent standard rate. The Diverted Profits Tax, initially designed outside the corporation tax system to avoid treaty coverage, will be repealed with equivalent charges brought within corporation tax from January 2026.

### 5.3. Asia-Pacific Jurisdictions

Australia's 2018 reform eliminated exemptions for low-value goods, applying ten percent GST through the vendor collection model. Singapore implemented GST on digital services from January 2020, expanding to all remote services from January 2023. The GST rate increased to nine percent from January 2024, with overseas vendor registration requirements applying above specified thresholds.

India developed the equalization levy as an alternative to GST—six percent on digital advertising and two percent on e-commerce transactions. Both levies have been abolished (August 2024 for e-commerce, April 2025 for digital advertising), aligning with the OECD Two-Pillar framework. GST on Online Information Database Access and Retrieval (OIDAR) services applies at eighteen percent.

## 6. Challenges and Enforcement

### 6.1. Compliance Burden

Over 110 countries now impose VAT/GST obligations on digital service providers, each with different registration thresholds, tax rates, filing frequencies, and administrative requirements. This jurisdictional fragmentation creates substantial compliance costs for multinational digital businesses.

Monitoring changing VAT laws across markets requires significant resources. Banking and technological limitations in target countries slow compliance infrastructure development. Tax and finance departments often spend disproportionate time on VAT compliance relative to revenue scale in smaller markets. Language barriers, varying documentation requirements, and technology compatibility issues add further complexity. Multinational companies expanding to new markets are often unaware of VAT obligations until non-compliance is discovered through audits or penalty notices.

### 6.2. Enforcement Mechanisms

Tax authorities increasingly implement digital compliance monitoring through AI-driven analytics and automated verification systems. The EU's 2025 ViDA package includes enhanced reporting protocols and automatic verification through tax databases. India's Directorate General of GST Intelligence has intensified scrutiny of non-compliant overseas digital service providers, with GST collections from overseas digital services increasing thirty-fold from ₹80 crore in 2017-18 to ₹2,675 crore in 2023-24.

Platform deemed supplier provisions improve enforcement efficiency by consolidating compliance at platform level rather than requiring individual seller monitoring. Platforms possess transaction data, customer information, and payment processing control enabling effective collection and reporting.

### 6.3. Digital Asset Uncertainties

Cryptocurrency and NFT taxation lack coherent international frameworks. The European Court of Justice in Skatteverket v David Hedqvist established that cryptocurrency exchange services (conventional currency to cryptocurrency) are VAT-exempt, treating Bitcoin similarly to fiat currencies. However, NFT treatment varies by jurisdiction—the EU treats NFT transactions as taxable supplies, Australia classifies NFTs as digital products subject to GST, and India applies eighteen percent GST to Virtual Digital Assets including NFTs.

## 7. Recent Developments

### 7.1. 2024-2025 Developments

The EU ViDA package adoption in March 2025 represents the most significant recent development, extending platform liability and implementing comprehensive reporting requirements. Filing deadlines extended from twenty to thirty days after quarter-end, with implementation phasing through 2035.

India's abolition of equalization levies during 2024-2025 eliminates double taxation concerns that arose from applying both levy and GST without offsetting credits. This simplifies overseas supplier compliance to GST registration only.

### 7.2. Standstill Expiration and Fragmentation

The July 2023 standstill agreement—under which 138 countries agreed not to impose new digital services taxes pending Pillar One implementation—expired on 31 December 2024. Countries have resumed unilateral measures, with Canada's three percent DST entering force with retrospective effect from January 2022.

The absence of binding multilateral frameworks means VAT/GST fragmentation continues. While OECD Guidelines provide consensus standards, implementation varies significantly across jurisdictions. Regional schemes like EU OSS/IOSS operate alongside national systems, creating compliance complexity for digital businesses operating globally.

The OECD has developed regional VAT Digital Toolkits for Africa (2023), Asia-Pacific (2022), and Latin America and the Caribbean (2021) to support consistent implementation. These toolkits provide practical guidance for jurisdictions implementing digital economy VAT measures, but adoption remains voluntary. The challenge of balancing revenue collection against compliance burden continues to shape policy development across diverse economic and administrative contexts.
