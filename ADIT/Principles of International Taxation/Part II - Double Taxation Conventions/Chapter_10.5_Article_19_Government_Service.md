## Chapter 10.5: Government Service – Article 19, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 19

Article 19 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) provides special rules for the taxation of remuneration—both salaries and pensions—paid by a Contracting State, its political subdivisions, or local authorities in respect of government service. The provision represents a significant departure from the normal rules applicable to employment income under Article 15 and private pensions under Article 18.

The article reflects long-standing principles of international comity and sovereign immunity. States have traditionally not taxed remuneration paid by other states to their government employees, recognising that such employees serve the interests of their employing state rather than the host state. Article 19 codifies this practice in treaty form, providing certainty for government employees working abroad.

#### 1.2. Policy Rationale

Several considerations underpin Article 19's special treatment. Sovereign immunity principles suggest that states should not tax each other's activities, and this extends to employees performing governmental functions. Government employees owe their primary allegiance to their employing state, which pays their salaries from public funds and directs their activities. Administrative convenience is served by having the paying state—which already administers payroll—also administer taxation. Reciprocity operates because all states have government employees abroad, and mutual benefit flows from the exclusive paying state rule.

The provision ensures that diplomatic staff, civil servants posted to embassies, and other government employees are not subject to host state taxation on their government service income. This facilitates international relations and the posting of government personnel abroad.

### 2. The Text of Article 19

#### 2.1. Article 19(1): Government Salaries

Article 19(1)(a) of the OECD MTC 2017 provides: "Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State."

Article 19(1)(b) provides an exception: "However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services."

#### 2.2. Article 19(2): Government Pensions

Article 19(2)(a) provides: "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 18, pensions and other similar remuneration paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State."

Article 19(2)(b) provides the exception: "However, such pensions and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State."

#### 2.3. Article 19(3): Business Activities Exception

Article 19(3) provides: "The provisions of Articles 15, 16, 17 and 18 shall apply to salaries, wages, pensions and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof."

### 3. Government Salaries Under Article 19(1)

#### 3.1. The Basic Rule

Under Article 19(1)(a), the paying state has the exclusive right to tax government service salaries. The income is "taxable only" in the paying state, meaning the other Contracting State—even if it is the employee's residence state—must exempt the income. This represents a departure from Article 15, which generally permits source state taxation of employment income exercised in that state.

The rule applies to salaries, wages, and other similar remuneration paid by the Contracting State, its political subdivisions (such as states, provinces, or regions), or local authorities (such as municipalities or councils). The payment must be in respect of services rendered to that governmental entity.

#### 3.2. The Nationality Exception

Article 19(1)(b) provides an exception that shifts taxing rights to the other Contracting State when three cumulative conditions are satisfied. First, the services must be rendered in that other state—physical presence during work is required. Second, the individual must be a resident of that other state under Article 4. Third, the individual must either be a national of that other state, or must not have become resident solely for the purpose of rendering the services.

The exception protects local nationals who work for foreign governments and persons who were already residents before taking government employment. An individual who is a national and resident of Country Y, employed locally by Country X's embassy in Country Y, is taxable in Country Y under this exception rather than in Country X under the basic rule.

The "solely for the purpose" test examines why the individual became resident. If the individual moved to the country specifically to take up government employment, the exception does not apply and the paying state retains exclusive taxing rights. If the individual was already resident for other reasons—family, personal choice, or prior employment—the exception applies and the residence state may tax.

### 4. Government Pensions Under Article 19(2)

#### 4.1. The Basic Rule

Article 19(2)(a) grants the paying state exclusive taxation over government pensions. This parallels the salary rule but for past service. Pensions paid by, or out of funds created by, the Contracting State for services rendered to that state are taxable only in the paying state.

The phrase "or out of funds created by" extends the rule to pension schemes established by governments, even where the pension is technically paid by a separate fund rather than directly by the state treasury.

Article 19(2)(a) expressly states "notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 18," confirming that government pensions are governed by Article 19 rather than the general pension rule in Article 18. Article 18's residence taxation principle does not apply to government pensions.

#### 4.2. The Stricter Pension Exception

The nationality exception for pensions under Article 19(2)(b) is narrower than for salaries. The other Contracting State may tax the pension only if the individual is both resident of and national of that state. Both conditions must be satisfied—either condition alone is insufficient.

This contrasts with salaries, where the exception applies if the individual is a national of the residence state or did not become resident solely for the services. For pensions, there is no "solely for the purpose" alternative—nationality is always required alongside residence.

A retired government employee who is a national of Country X, worked for Country X, and now resides in Country Y receives a pension taxable only in Country X (paying state) because the individual is not a national of Country Y. If the retiree were a national of Country Y, the pension would be taxable only in Country Y.

### 5. The Business Activities Exception

#### 5.1. Article 19(3) Overview

Article 19(3) carves out from the special government service rules any income in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a state. When the state acts commercially rather than governmentally, normal employment and pension rules apply—Articles 15, 16, 17, and 18 govern rather than Article 19.

The rationale is that Article 19's special treatment is for governmental functions. When a state engages in commercial activities, it competes with private sector employers and should be treated equivalently for tax purposes. State-owned commercial enterprises should not enjoy tax advantages over private competitors merely because the shareholder is a government.

#### 5.2. Governmental vs Business Functions

The distinction between governmental and business functions requires case-by-case analysis. Governmental functions clearly covered by Article 19 include diplomatic and consular services, military personnel, civil servants in government departments, judges and judicial staff, police and law enforcement, and public administration.

Business activities excluded from Article 19 by paragraph 3 include state-owned commercial enterprises, national airlines (state-owned), state-owned banks and manufacturing companies, and public utilities operated commercially.

Grey areas requiring specific analysis include central bank employees, port authorities, public universities (distinguishing teaching from commercial research), public hospitals (distinguishing public health from fee-paying services), and cultural institutions operated commercially.

### 6. Scope and Definitions

#### 6.1. Qualifying Payers

Article 19 applies to payments by the Contracting State itself (central or federal government), political subdivisions (states in federal systems, provinces, regions, autonomous territories), and local authorities (municipalities, cities, counties, districts, local councils).

Entities not automatically covered include state-owned enterprises (which may fall within Article 19(3)), sovereign wealth funds (which may not involve "services rendered"), and international organisations (which are not "Contracting States" and have separate privileges and immunities arrangements).

#### 6.2. "Services Rendered To" the State

The services must be rendered to the state as employer. This includes direct employment by government and work performed under government direction and control. It excludes independent contractors providing services to government (who may fall within Article 7), seconded employees from the private sector, and consultants without an employment relationship.

#### 6.3. Nationality

Nationality for Article 19 purposes is determined by Article 3(1)(g), which defines "national" as any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State. Dual nationals who hold nationality of the residence state satisfy the nationality requirement for the exception.

### 7. Relationship with Other Articles

#### 7.1. Article 19 vs Article 15

Article 19 takes priority over Article 15 as lex specialis. Government service salaries are governed by Article 19's paying state rule rather than Article 15's residence/source framework. The 183-day rule of Article 15(2) is irrelevant for government service—Article 19 applies regardless of the length of presence in the host state.

However, when Article 19(3) applies (state business activities), the employee is treated as if employed by a private employer and Article 15 governs with its standard rules.

#### 7.2. Article 19(2) vs Article 18

Article 19(2) takes priority over Article 18 for government pensions. The paying state has exclusive taxation rather than the residence state taxation that Article 18 provides for private pensions. Article 19(2)(a) expressly confirms this priority with its "notwithstanding" language.

### 8. UN Model Comparison

The UN Model Tax Convention Article 19 is identical to the OECD Model. The same paying state rules apply, the same nationality exceptions, and the same business activities exception. This reflects that government service provisions embody international comity principles equally recognised by developed and developing countries.

Unlike some other articles where the UN Model diverges to protect developing country revenue interests, Article 19's allocation based on the paying state is accepted by both treaty traditions.

### 9. Special Cases

#### 9.1. Diplomats and Consular Officials

Diplomatic and consular staff are typically covered by both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961), the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963), and Article 19 of tax treaties. The Vienna Conventions provide tax exemption in the host state, while Article 19 allocates taxing rights to the sending state. These frameworks complement rather than conflict with each other.

#### 9.2. International Organisation Employees

Employees of international organisations—United Nations, IMF, World Bank, EU, OECD, WTO—are not covered by Article 19. The provision applies to "a Contracting State," and international organisations are not states. Such employees are typically covered by separate privileges and immunities agreements specific to their organisation, often providing tax exemption or special treatment.

### 10. Saving Clause Exception

Article 19 is excepted from the saving clause in Article 1(3). A Contracting State cannot use the saving clause to tax its own residents on government service income that falls within Article 19.

If an individual is resident in Country Y but receives government service income from Country X that is taxable only in Country X under Article 19(1)(a), Country Y cannot invoke the saving clause to override this allocation and tax the income. The saving clause exception ensures that Article 19's special allocation operates as intended.

### 11. Practical Application

#### 11.1. Embassy Staff Scenarios

The most common application of Article 19 involves embassy staff. Consider an individual who is a national of Country X, working at Country X's embassy in Country Y. Under Article 19(1)(a), the salary is taxable only in Country X as the paying state. Even though the employee resides and works in Country Y, Country Y has no taxing rights.

Now consider whether Article 19(1)(b) applies. The services are rendered in Country Y. The individual is resident of Country Y. But is the individual a national of Country Y? If the individual is a national of Country X only, the nationality limb of the exception fails. The "solely for the purpose" limb must then be examined: did the individual become resident of Country Y solely to render the embassy services?

If the individual relocated to Country Y specifically for the embassy position, the exception does not apply—Country X retains exclusive taxation. If the individual was already resident in Country Y for other reasons before taking the embassy job, the exception applies—Country Y may tax the salary.

#### 11.2. Retired Government Employee Scenarios

A retired civil servant presents different considerations. Suppose an individual worked for Country X government throughout their career, retired, and moved to Country Y. The individual is a national of Country X.

Under Article 19(2)(a), the government pension is taxable only in Country X. The exception in Article 19(2)(b) requires that the individual be both resident of and national of Country Y. The individual is resident of Country Y but is a national of Country X, not Country Y. The exception does not apply.

Result: Country X has exclusive taxation despite the individual's residence in Country Y. This outcome differs from private pensions under Article 18, which would be taxable in Country Y as the residence state.

#### 11.3. Local Hire Scenarios

Local hire staff—individuals employed locally by foreign embassies or consulates—often fall within the Article 19(1)(b) exception. Consider a national and resident of Country Y employed as administrative staff at Country X's embassy in Country Y.

Article 19(1)(a) would make the salary taxable only in Country X. But Article 19(1)(b) applies: services are rendered in Country Y, the individual is resident of Country Y, and the individual is a national of Country Y. The exception is satisfied.

Result: The salary is taxable only in Country Y, not Country X. This protects local nationals from paying state taxation on employment income while ensuring they contribute to their residence state's tax base.

### 12. Commentary Analysis

#### 12.1. Key Commentary Provisions

The OECD Commentary on Article 19 provides important guidance. Paragraphs 1-2 discuss the general scope and policy rationale, confirming that Article 19 reflects international practice regarding taxation of government employees abroad. Paragraphs 5-6 address the business exception, explaining that the distinction depends on the nature of services rendered—governmental versus commercial.

The Commentary notes that the fact the employer is a state does not automatically bring income within Article 19. If services are rendered in connection with commercial or industrial activities, Article 19(3) applies and normal employment rules govern.

#### 12.2. Historical Development

Article 19 has evolved through several updates. The 2005 Update amended paragraph 1 by deleting "other than a pension" from subparagraph (a), clarifying that paragraphs 1 and 2 operate independently. Paragraph 2 now clearly governs all government pensions without overlap with paragraph 1.

The original 1963 Draft Convention referred to services "in the discharge of functions of a governmental nature," language later restructured into the current format emphasising the paying entity rather than the functional nature of the work.

### 13. Policy Considerations

#### 13.1. Rationale for Paying State Taxation

The paying state rule reflects several policy considerations beyond sovereign immunity. The paying state has the closest connection to the income—it determines the employment terms, pays from public funds, and benefits from the services rendered. The paying state can most easily administer taxation through payroll withholding.

Additionally, government employees abroad may receive cost-of-living adjustments, hardship allowances, or other benefits that the paying state is better positioned to account for in determining appropriate tax treatment.

#### 13.2. Limits of the Special Treatment

Article 19's special treatment applies only to governmental functions. When states engage in commercial activities, they compete with private sector employers. Extending Article 19 treatment to state-owned commercial enterprises would create competitive distortions—government-employed workers would receive favourable tax treatment compared to private sector counterparts performing equivalent work.

Article 19(3) ensures level playing field treatment. An employee of a state-owned airline or bank is taxed under the same rules as an employee of a private airline or bank.

### 14. Comparison with Private Employment

#### 14.1. Key Differences from Article 15

Several significant differences distinguish Article 19 from Article 15. Under Article 15, residence state taxation is the default, with source state taxation when employment is exercised there. Under Article 19, paying state taxation is exclusive unless the nationality exception applies.

The 183-day threshold of Article 15(2) is irrelevant for government service—Article 19 applies regardless of presence duration. Nationality is irrelevant for private employment but critical for government service.

The contrast reflects different policy priorities: Article 15 balances residence and source claims based on economic connection, while Article 19 prioritises the sovereign interests of the employing state.

#### 14.2. Key Differences from Article 18

For pensions, Article 19(2) grants paying state taxation while Article 18 grants residence state taxation. An individual receiving both government and private pensions may face split treatment—government pension taxable in the paying state, private pension taxable in the residence state.

This creates potential administrative complexity but reflects the different policy rationales: government pensions continue the paying state's connection from active service, while private pensions lack such governmental nexus.
