Syllabus Area: II.J.3 - Entertainers and sportspersons – Article 17,
               OECD MTC and UN MDTC
Syllabus Level: 3 (Advanced Knowledge)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Exam Frequency: HIGH - Dedicated scenario questions
Recent Appearances:
  • June 2023 Q7: Comprehensive Article 17 question (Azuria music
                 festival - performance fees, TV appearances,
                 payments to agents, "closely connected" income)
  • June 2022: Article 17 reference in context of distributive rules

Strategic Priority: ★★★★★ CRITICAL
- Unique exception to Articles 7 and 15
- Source taxation without PE or 183-day threshold
- Article 17(2) "star company" / look-through provision
- "Closely connected" income concept
- Commentary paragraphs [3], [8], [8.1], [9] are key
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE UNIQUE NATURE OF ARTICLE 17

### 1.1 Purpose and Function

Article 17 provides a **special rule** for taxing income derived by entertainers and sportspersons. It grants the **source state** (where the performance takes place) the right to tax, even where:
- There is no PE (overriding Article 7)
- The 183-day threshold is not met (overriding Article 15)
- Income is paid to a third party like an agent or company (Article 17(2))

### 1.2 Rationale

```
WHY ARTICLE 17 EXISTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES WITHOUT ARTICLE 17:
• Entertainers/sportspersons often work briefly in many countries
• Under Article 7: No PE = No source taxation
• Under Article 15: <183 days = Possible residence-only taxation
• Result: High earners could escape source taxation entirely

ARTICLE 17 SOLUTION:
• Source state can tax performance income
• No minimum presence threshold
• No PE requirement
• Applies even if income paid to third parties

POLICY CONSIDERATIONS:
✓ Ensures source taxation of high-profile performers
✓ Addresses "star company" tax planning
✗ Creates compliance burden for lower-income performers
✗ May impede cultural/sporting exchanges

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 1.3 June 2023 Exam Context

From the June 2023 Q7 solution:
> "Article 17 OECD MTC 2017 provides that where a resident of a jurisdiction derives income from a relevant performance activity that is exercised in another jurisdiction then the state in which the activity is performed may tax the income. Article 17 overrides Articles 7(4) and 15(2)..."

---

## 2. ARTICLE 17 TEXT (OECD MTC 2017)

### 2.1 Full Text

**Article 17(1):**
> "Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State."

**Article 17(2):**
> "Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised."

### 2.2 Structure Overview

| Paragraph | Content | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **17(1)** | Direct income to performer | Source state may tax performance income |
| **17(2)** | Income to third parties | Source state may tax even if paid to agent/company |

---

## 3. ARTICLE 17(1): DIRECT INCOME TO PERFORMERS

### 3.1 "Notwithstanding Articles 7 and 15"

This phrase establishes Article 17 as **lex specialis** that overrides:
- **Article 7**: Business profits (no PE required)
- **Article 15**: Employment income (no 183-day threshold)

**Commentary [1]:**
> "This Article deals with a special case of the general rules of Articles 7 and 15 for profits derived from personal activities."

### 3.2 Who is an "Entertainer"?

```
DEFINITION OF "ENTERTAINER" - COMMENTARY [3]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"It is not possible to give a precise definition of 'entertainer'"

EXAMPLES GIVEN:
• Theatre performers (actors)
• Motion picture artistes
• Radio artistes
• Television artistes
• Musicians

ALSO INCLUDED:
• Stage performers
• Circus performers
• Variety show participants
• Models (in some contexts)

NOT INCLUDED (Commentary [3]):
• Administrative/support staff
• Producers, directors (unless performing)
• Technical crew
• Conference speakers (generally)

JUNE 2023 EXAM APPLICATION:
"The Commentary on Article 17, (paragraph 3) notes that it is not
possible to give a full list of what constitutes an 'entertainer,'
but that stage performers are clearly included."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.3 Who is a "Sportsperson"?

The term includes:
- Professional athletes
- Amateur athletes receiving income
- E-sportspersons (emerging area)
- Members of sports teams

### 3.4 "Personal Activities as Such"

The income must be derived from **personal performance activities**:
- Actual performance/competition
- Activities "closely connected" to performance
- NOT: Management, coaching (unless also performing)

### 3.5 "Exercised in the Other Contracting State"

Source taxation requires **physical presence** during performance:
- Where the entertainment/sporting event takes place
- Where the performer is physically present
- NOT: Remote participation (generally Article 7 or 15)

---

## 4. ARTICLE 17(2): THE "STAR COMPANY" PROVISION

### 4.1 Purpose

Article 17(2) addresses tax planning through **interposed entities**:

```
THE STAR COMPANY PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WITHOUT ARTICLE 17(2):

  Performer    →    Low-tax Company    →    Performance fees
  (Residence       (Another              (Paid to company,
   State A)         jurisdiction)         not performer)

  Problem: Source state cannot tax - income goes to company
           Company has no PE in source state
           Performer receives "salary" from low-tax company

WITH ARTICLE 17(2):

  Source state can "look through" the arrangement
  Tax the income WHERE THE ACTIVITY IS EXERCISED
  Regardless of who receives the payment

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.2 "Accrues Not to the Entertainer... But to Another Person"

Article 17(2) applies when income is paid to:
- Agent or manager
- Management company
- "Star company" / "Artiste company"
- Sports team (for team sports)
- Any other third party

### 4.3 June 2023 Exam Application

From the suggested solution:
> "The payment for the television performance is made to the agent of each non-resident performer, i.e. not to the non-resident performer themselves. Article 17 would appear to apply to this income, irrespective of the fact that the income was derived indirectly (i.e. through their agent) (Commentary on art.17, [8])."

---

## 5. "CLOSELY CONNECTED" INCOME

### 5.1 The Concept

Income that is **closely connected** to a performance may also fall within Article 17, even if not directly for the performance itself.

### 5.2 Commentary Guidance [9]

```
CLOSELY CONNECTED INCOME - COMMENTARY [9]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TEST:
"A close connection may exist where it cannot reasonably be
considered that the income would have been derived in the
absence of the performance"

EXAMPLES OF CLOSELY CONNECTED INCOME:
• Appearance fees
• Prize money
• Sponsorship payments linked to event
• Endorsement fees at event venue
• Interview fees during competition
• Television appearance immediately after performance

NOT CLOSELY CONNECTED:
• General sponsorship (not event-specific)
• Advertising income from residence state
• Royalties from previous performances
• Income from unrelated activities

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5.3 June 2023 Exam Application

From the suggested solution:
> "The Income from the television performance (which takes place immediately after the relevant performer's performance), would also appear to fall within Article 17 where it is considered to be 'closely connected' to the performance at the music festival. A close connection may exist where it cannot reasonably be considered that the income would have been derived in the absence of the performance at the music festival (Commentary on art.17, [9])."

## 6. KEY COMMENTARY PARAGRAPHS

### 6.1 Essential References

| Commentary | Content | Exam Relevance |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **[3]** | Definition of entertainer | June 2023 - who is covered |
| **[8]** | Attribution of income | Payments to performers |
| **[8.1]** | Application regardless of payer | Who makes payment irrelevant |
| **[9]** | Closely connected income | TV appearance test |
| **[9.4]** | Broadcasting rights | Royalties vs Article 17 |
| **[11]** | Team sports | Article 17(2) application |

### 6.2 Commentary [8] - Attribution

> "The provisions of Article 17 apply regardless of who actually pays the income, i.e. it does not matter whether the payment is made to the performers by the [government] or by the festival organisers."

### 6.3 Commentary [8.1] - No Apportionment Needed

Where payment relates solely to performance in source state:
> "As the fee is paid directly to the performers in respect of their performance, there is no need to consider apportionment of the remuneration, as it relates solely to the performance in [source state]."

## 7. INTERACTION WITH OTHER ARTICLES

### 7.1 Article 17 vs Article 7 (Business Profits)

```
ARTICLE 17 vs ARTICLE 7
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ARTICLE 7:                        ARTICLE 17:
────────────────────────          ────────────────────────────
Requires PE for source taxation   NO PE required
Business profits generally        Performance income only
Arm's length profit attribution   Full income taxable at source
Applies to enterprises            Applies to individuals AND
                                  companies (via 17(2))

ARTICLE 17 OVERRIDES ARTICLE 7:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 15..."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 7.2 Article 17 vs Article 15 (Employment Income)

| Feature | Article 15 | Article 17 |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **183-day rule** | Applies | Does NOT apply |
| **Employer residence** | Relevant for 15(2) | Irrelevant |
| **PE bearing cost** | Relevant for 15(2) | Irrelevant |
| **Source threshold** | Conditions apply | None |

### 7.3 Article 17 and Article 12 (Royalties)

Broadcasting rights may raise Article 12 questions:
- **Article 17**: Performance itself
- **Article 12**: Subsequent broadcasting/reproduction rights
- Commentary [9.4] provides guidance on allocation

---

## 8. UN MODEL DIFFERENCES

### 8.1 Substantially Similar

The UN Model Article 17 is substantially similar to the OECD Model. Both:
- Grant source taxation for performers
- Include the Article 17(2) look-through provision
- Use same basic structure

### 8.2 Commentary Differences

UN Commentary may reflect developing country perspectives:
- Broader interpretation of "entertainer"
- Some countries reserve positions on specific issues
- Commentary [3] notes countries like Argentina, Brazil, Malaysia, China, and India have different views on scope

### 8.3 Reservations

Some countries have reservations regarding:
- Models and fashion shows
- Speakers at conferences
- Application to specific types of performers

---

## 9. PRACTICAL ISSUES

### 9.1 Withholding Tax Enforcement

From June 2023 exam:
> "Azuria could, under the terms of Article 17 (OECD MTC 2017), apply a withholding tax on the gross income earned by the international performer to ensure that tax is levied on the income derived."

### 9.2 Compliance Challenges

- Short presence in source state
- Multiple jurisdictions in one tour
- Documentation requirements
- Expense deduction limitations

### 9.3 2014 Commentary Reforms

The OECD recognized practical difficulties and recommended:
- Exemption for groups with employees
- Minimum monetary thresholds (US Model approach)
- Deduction of expenses
- Limiting Article 17(2) to abusive situations

---

## 10. EXAM APPLICATION

### 10.3 Common Exam Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Applying 183-day rule | Article 17 overrides Article 15(2) |
| Requiring PE for source tax | Article 17 overrides Article 7 |
| Missing payments to agents | Article 17(2) applies |
| Ignoring closely connected income | Apply Commentary [9] test |
| Confusing with Article 12 (royalties) | Article 17 for performance; Article 12 for reproduction |

*Chapter 11.3 covers syllabus area II.J.3 - Entertainers and sportspersons – Article 17, OECD MTC and UN MDTC. This is a Level 3 topic requiring advanced knowledge of how Article 17 overrides Articles 7 and 15, the "star company" look-through provision in Article 17(2), the "closely connected income" test from Commentary [9], and ability to apply these rules to performance scenarios.*
