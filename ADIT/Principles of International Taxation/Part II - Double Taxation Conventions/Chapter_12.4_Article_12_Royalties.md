## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE ROLE OF ARTICLE 12

### 1.1 Purpose and Function

Article 12 allocates taxing rights over **royalty payments** between the source state (where the payer is resident or where royalties are connected with a PE) and the residence state (where the beneficial owner is resident). Unlike Articles 10 and 11 which use "shared allocation," the **OECD Model provides EXCLUSIVE residence state taxation** for royalties—one of the most significant differences from the UN Model.

### 1.2 What Are Royalties?

Royalties represent payments for the use of, or right to use, **intellectual property rights**:
- Copyright (literary, artistic, scientific works)
- Patents, trademarks, designs, models
- Secret formulae or processes
- Industrial, commercial, or scientific know-how

The fundamental characteristic is that royalties compensate the owner of intellectual property for granting others the right to exploit that property.

### 1.3 Policy Rationale: Why Exclusive Residence Taxation?

│ 1. CAPITAL MOBILITY ARGUMENT                                   │
│    → IP easily moves across borders                            │
│    → WHT distorts location decisions                           │

│    → No need for withholding at source                         │
│    → Reduces compliance costs                                   │
│    → Eliminates double taxation credit complexities            │

│ 3. CAPITAL EXPORT NEUTRALITY                                   │
│    → Investor taxed same regardless of where IP used           │
│    → Promotes efficient capital allocation                     │
│                                                                 │
│ 4. OECD MEMBER INTERESTS                                       │
│    → Most IP owned by residents of developed countries         │
│    → Royalties flow TO OECD countries                          │
│    → Exclusive residence taxation benefits IP exporters        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This contrasts sharply with the UN Model's position, which recognizes developing countries' interests in taxing royalty outflows at source. The difference reflects fundamentally different perspectives on where value is created when IP is exploited internationally.

## 2. ARTICLE 12 TEXT AND STRUCTURE (OECD MTC 2017)

### 2.1 Full Text

**Article 12(1):**
> "Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State."

**Article 12(2): Definition**
> "The term 'royalties' as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience."

**Article 12(3): PE Exception**
> "The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply."

**Article 12(4): Arm's Length Provision**
> "Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention."

## 3. ARTICLE 12(1): EXCLUSIVE RESIDENCE STATE TAXATION

### 3.1 The "Taxable Only" Language

```
EXCLUSIVE TAXATION - KEY LANGUAGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned
by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable
ONLY in that other State."

CRITICAL DISTINCTION FROM ARTICLES 10 AND 11:
┌──────────────────┬───────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ ARTICLE          │ LANGUAGE          │ EFFECT                  │
├──────────────────┼───────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Article 10       │ "may be taxed"    │ SHARED allocation       │
│ (Dividends)      │ + rate limits     │ Both states may tax     │
├──────────────────┼───────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Article 11       │ "may be taxed"    │ SHARED allocation       │
│ (Interest)       │ + rate limits     │ Source limited to 10%   │
├──────────────────┼───────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Article 12       │ "shall be taxable │ EXCLUSIVE allocation    │
│ (Royalties)      │ ONLY"             │ Source cannot tax       │
└──────────────────┴───────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

CONSEQUENCE:
→ Source state MUST refrain from taxing royalties
→ No WHT permitted on royalties under OECD Model
→ Residence state has sole taxing right
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.2 Beneficial Owner Requirement

The beneficial ownership test in Article 12 operates identically to Articles 10 and 11. The recipient must have the **unconstrained right to use and enjoy** the royalties without a contractual or legal obligation to pass them on to another person.

```
BENEFICIAL OWNER TEST FOR ROYALTIES

│ BENEFICIAL OWNER:                                               │
│ ✓ Has right to use and enjoy royalties unconstrained           │
│ ✓ No obligation to pass payment to another person              │
│ ✓ Bears economic risk of ownership                             │
│                                                                 │
│ NOT BENEFICIAL OWNER (CONDUIT/AGENT):                          │
│ ✗ Contractually obligated to pass on payments                  │
│ ✗ Acts as mere fiduciary or administrator                      │
│ ✗ Very narrow powers over the royalties                        │
│ ✗ Back-to-back licensing arrangements                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

KEY CASE: Velcro Canada v The Queen (2012)
→ Taxpayer found to be beneficial owner of royalty
→ Entitled to Canada-Netherlands DTA reduced rate (10%)
→ Instead of domestic law rate (25%)

## 4. ARTICLE 12(2): DEFINITION OF ROYALTIES

### 4.1 Autonomous Definition

Unlike Articles 10 and 11 where the terms "dividends" and "interest" are partially defined by reference to domestic law, **Article 12 provides an autonomous treaty definition** of royalties. This was confirmed in the 1999/2000 Commentary changes and is considered preferable because reliance on domestic law could lead to classification mismatches between contracting states.

### 4.2 Categories of Payments Covered

COMMENTARY [11.4]:
"Where the payments are for technical assistance or after-sales
services, such payments are more likely to be classified as
payments for services [Article 7]."

COMMENTARY [11.5]:
"Where payments are made for the transfer of proprietary
information (e.g. trade secrets), such payments may be
classified as royalties [Article 12]."

### 5.3 Practical Application: December 2024 Q7 Analysis

The December 2024 exam presented a scenario involving:
- SA (software company resident in Country A)
- CAI (client company resident in Country B)
- Licensing of beta version software
- Restrictions: no sublicensing, no distribution, no reverse engineering
- Lump sum payment + hourly advisory service payments

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

KEY EXAM POINT:
Even though Country B's domestic law imposed 15% WHT on royalty
payments to non-residents, the OECD MTC provides exclusive
residence state taxation, so if payments are NOT royalties,
Article 7 applies and Country A has sole taxing rights.

### 6.2 "Effectively Connected" Test

The IP must be effectively connected with the PE. This means the IP right or property from which the royalties derive must form part of the PE's business assets or activities:
- The patent is exploited through the PE
- The trademark is used in the PE's business
- The know-how is applied in the PE's operations

## 8. UN MODEL: FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE

### 8.1 Shared vs Exclusive Taxation

The most fundamental difference between the OECD and UN Models regarding royalties is the **allocation of taxing rights**:

```
OECD vs UN MODEL - ARTICLE 12 COMPARISON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OECD MODEL ARTICLE 12(1):
"Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned
by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable
ONLY in that other State."
→ EXCLUSIVE residence state taxation
→ Source state CANNOT tax

UN MODEL ARTICLE 12(1):
"Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident
of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

UN MODEL ARTICLE 12(2):
"However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting
State in which they arise and according to the laws of that
State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident
of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not
exceed ___ per cent..."
→ SHARED allocation (like Articles 10 and 11)
→ Source state MAY tax (with rate limitation)

┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐

│ • IP development requires significant investment               │
│ • Residence taxation rewards innovation                        │

### 8.3 UN Model Source Rules

Unlike the OECD Model, the UN Model includes **source determination rules** for royalties:

```
UN MODEL - SOURCE OF ROYALTIES (Article 12(5))
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ROYALTIES DEEMED TO ARISE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. WHERE PAYER IS RESIDENT                                      │
│    → Primary source rule                                        │
│    → Same as Article 11 interest source rule                   │
│                                                                 │
│ 2. WHERE DEBT-CLAIM/IP CONNECTED WITH PE                        │
│    → If payer has PE and royalty is expense of PE              │
│    → Royalties arise where PE is situated                       │
│    → Regardless of payer's residence                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

NOTE: OECD Model has NO explicit source rule in Article 12

│ CHILE, GREECE, MEXICO, PORTUGAL, TURKEY:                        │
│ → Reserve right to impose source taxation on royalties         │
│ → Rates vary by treaty                                          │
│                                                                 │
│ DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, MALAYSIA (Position [12.2]):       │
│ → Reserve positions on royalty definition                       │
│ → May include broader categories                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

PRACTICAL IMPACT:
→ Many actual DTAs differ from OECD Model zero rate
→ Always check the specific treaty
→ Source taxation rates commonly range from 5% to 15%
→ Some treaties follow UN Model approach

## 11. WORKED EXAM EXAMPLES

### 11.1 December 2024 Q7 Analysis (25 marks)

```
DECEMBER 2024 Q7 - SOFTWARE AND ROYALTIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO:
• SA (Country A resident) licenses beta software to CAI (Country B)
• Lump sum payment for software license
• Hourly payments for advisory services
• Restrictions: no sublicensing, no modification, no distribution
• Country B domestic law: 15% WHT on royalties
• OECD MTC 2017 treaty between countries

KEY ISSUES TO ADDRESS:

1. CLASSIFICATION OF LUMP SUM PAYMENT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Does CAI acquire copyright exploitation rights?              │
│ • Commentary [13.1] vs [14] analysis                           │
│ • Restrictions suggest operational use only                    │
│ • Likely: Business profits (Article 7), not royalties          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

2. CLASSIFICATION OF HOURLY PAYMENTS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Time-based billing = service characteristic                  │
│ • Commentary [11.4]: technical assistance = services           │
│ • Conclusion: Business profits (Article 7)                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

3. PE ANALYSIS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • SA employees denied access to CAI offices                    │
│ • Hotdesking for 7 days total                                  │
│ • 15 days total in Country B                                   │
│ • No fixed place at disposal                                   │
│ • Likely: NO PE in Country B                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. TAXING RIGHTS CONCLUSION:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Both payments = Article 7 business profits                   │
│ • No PE in Country B                                           │
│ • Country A has SOLE taxing rights                             │
│ • Country B's 15% domestic WHT NOT applicable                  │
│   (Article 7 protects against source taxation without PE)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ALTERNATIVE: IF CLASSIFIED AS ROYALTIES:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Under OECD MTC 2017:                                            │
│ • Article 12(1): "taxable ONLY" in residence state             │
│ • Country A still has exclusive taxing rights                  │
│ • Country B's 15% WHT overridden by treaty                     │
│                                                                 │
│ Note: Same result either way under OECD Model!                 │
│ (Unless PE exists)                                              │

### 11.2 Typical Royalty Classification Question

```
PRACTICE SCENARIO: TRADEMARK LICENSE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FACTS:
ParentCo (Country A resident) licenses its global trademark to
SubCo (Country B resident) for use in Country B market.
• Annual royalty: 4% of SubCo's net sales
• SubCo may use trademark on products and marketing
• SubCo cannot sublicense without ParentCo consent
• Countries have DTC based on OECD Model

ANALYSIS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. IS THIS A ROYALTY? (Article 12(2))                           │
│    → Payment for use of trademark                               │
│    → "trade mark" explicitly listed in definition              │
│    → YES - falls within Article 12                             │
│                                                                 │
│ 2. TAXING RIGHTS (Article 12(1))                                │
│    → OECD Model: "taxable ONLY" in residence state             │
│    → Country A (ParentCo residence) has exclusive right        │
│    → Country B CANNOT impose WHT                                │
│                                                                 │
│ 3. PE EXCEPTION (Article 12(3))                                 │
│    → Does ParentCo have PE in Country B?                       │
│    → If YES and trademark connected with PE → Article 7        │
│    → If NO → Article 12 applies, Country A exclusive           │
│                                                                 │
│ 4. ARM'S LENGTH (Article 12(4))                                 │
│    → Is 4% of net sales arm's length?                          │
│    → If excessive, only ALP portion protected                  │
│    → Excess taxable under domestic law                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ERROR 5: Missing arm's length analysis for related parties
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✗ WRONG: Ignoring Article 12(4) when parties are related       │
│ ✓ CORRECT: Consider whether royalty rate is arm's length       │
│                                                                 │
│ PREVENTION: For intra-group royalties, always discuss 12(4)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ERROR 6: Applying wrong model without checking
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✗ WRONG: Assuming OECD Model when treaty follows UN Model      │
│ ✓ CORRECT: Check which model the treaty is based on            │
│                                                                 │

## 13. ANSWER FRAMEWORK FOR ARTICLE 12 QUESTIONS

```
STRUCTURED APPROACH TO ROYALTY QUESTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE TREATY BASIS (2-3 minutes)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • OECD Model → Exclusive residence taxation (zero at source)   │
│ • UN Model → Shared allocation (source may tax)                │
│ • Specific treaty → Check actual provisions                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 2: CLASSIFY THE PAYMENT (5-8 minutes)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ a) Is it within Article 12(2) definition?                       │
│    → Copyright, patent, trademark, know-how?                   │
│                                                                 │
│ b) Software payment?                                            │
│    → Use of copyright (Article 12) or                          │
│    → Use of copyrighted product (Article 7)?                   │
│                                                                 │
│ c) Mixed contract?                                              │
│    → Separate royalty and service elements                     │
│    → Or apply principal purpose test                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 3: CHECK PE EXCEPTION (3-5 minutes)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Does beneficial owner have PE in source state?               │
│ • Is IP effectively connected with that PE?                    │
│ • If yes to both → Article 7 applies instead                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 4: APPLY BENEFICIAL OWNER TEST (2-3 minutes)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Is recipient the beneficial owner?                            │
│ • Any conduit/agent arrangements?                               │
│ • Treaty benefits only available to beneficial owner           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 5: CONSIDER ARM'S LENGTH (2-3 minutes)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Related parties involved?                                     │
│ • Is royalty rate arm's length?                                │
│ • Article 12(4) limits protection to ALP amount                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 6: STATE TAXING RIGHTS (2-3 minutes)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ OECD Model: Residence state EXCLUSIVE (source cannot tax)      │
│ UN Model: Source may tax (negotiated rate), residence primary  │
│ With PE: Source state taxes via Article 7                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 7: CONCLUDE (1-2 minutes)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Clear statement of which state(s) may tax                    │
│ • Any applicable rate limitations                               │
│ • Double taxation relief method                                 │

## 17. CHAPTER SUMMARY

Article 12 governs the taxation of royalty payments under double tax conventions. The most significant feature of the **OECD Model** is that it provides **exclusive residence state taxation**—the source state has no right to tax royalties. This differs fundamentally from Articles 10 and 11, which use shared allocation with limited source taxation.

The **UN Model** takes a different approach, allowing source states to impose withholding tax on royalties at a negotiated rate, reflecting developing countries' interests in taxing outbound IP payments.

For exam purposes, the **Article 7/12 boundary** is critical, particularly for software payments. The December 2024 exam devoted 25 marks to this issue. Key distinctions include:
- **Know-how** (Article 12) vs **services** (Article 7)
- **Use of copyright** (Article 12) vs **use of copyrighted product** (Article 7)

Always remember to check:
1. Which model the treaty follows
2. Whether payments are royalties or services
3. The PE exception (Article 12(3))
4. Beneficial ownership
5. Arm's length requirements for related party transactions
