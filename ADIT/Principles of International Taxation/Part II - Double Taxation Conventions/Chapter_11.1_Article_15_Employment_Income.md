## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE ROLE OF ARTICLE 15

### 1.1 Purpose and Function

Article 15 allocates taxing rights over **employment income** (salaries, wages, and similar remuneration) between Contracting States. Historically called "dependent personal services" (contrasting with Article 14's "independent personal services"), Article 15 deals with income earned by employees rather than self-employed individuals.

### 1.2 Fundamental Principles

Article 15 embodies two competing principles:

```
ARTICLE 15 CORE PRINCIPLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. RESIDENCE PRINCIPLE (Default)
   Employment income taxable in employee's STATE OF RESIDENCE
   → Reflects personal attachment to residence country

2. SOURCE/PLACE-OF-WORK PRINCIPLE (Exception)
   Employment income may be taxed where EMPLOYMENT IS EXERCISED
   → Reflects economic activity in source state

ARTICLE 15 BALANCES THESE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Article 15(1): If employment exercised in other state →       │
│                 Source state MAY tax                           │
│                                                                 │
│  Article 15(2): EXCEPTION - Short-term assignments with        │
│                 limited nexus → Residence state ONLY           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 1.3 Relationship with Other Articles

Article 15 is subject to the more specific provisions of Articles 16-19:

| Article | Subject | Takes Precedence |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Article 16** | Directors' fees | Yes |
| **Article 17** | Entertainers/sportspersons | Yes |
| **Article 18** | Pensions | Yes |
| **Article 19** | Government service | Yes |

If income does not fall within Article 15 or Articles 16-19, it may be "other income" under Article 21.

---

## 2. ARTICLE 15 TEXT AND STRUCTURE (OECD MTC 2017)

### 2.1 Full Text

**Article 15(1):**
> "Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State."

**Article 15(2):**
> "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:
> (a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned, and
> (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and
> (c) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State."

**Article 15(3):**
> "Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic, or aboard a boat engaged in inland waterways transport, may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated."

### 2.2 Structure Overview

| Paragraph | Content | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **15(1) first sentence** | Basic rule | Residence state exclusive unless employment exercised elsewhere |
| **15(1) second sentence** | Place-of-work principle | Source state may tax if employment exercised there |
| **15(2)** | 183-day exception | Residence state only if all three conditions met |
| **15(3)** | Ship/aircraft crew | POEM state may tax |

---

## 3. ARTICLE 15(1): THE BASIC RULES

### 3.1 First Sentence: Residence State Taxation

> "...salaries, wages and other similar remuneration... shall be taxable **only in that State** unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State"

The word "only" grants **exclusive** taxing rights to the residence state where employment is exercised only in the residence state.

### 3.2 Second Sentence: Place-of-Work Principle

> "If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom **may be taxed** in that other State"

When employment is exercised in the other state, that state acquires a **shared taxing right**. "May be taxed" indicates both states can tax, with double taxation relief under Article 23.

### 3.3 Scope of "Salaries, Wages and Other Similar Remuneration"

```
INCOME COVERED BY ARTICLE 15
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXPRESSLY INCLUDED:
• Salaries and wages
• Bonuses and commissions
• Benefits in kind (Commentary [2.1]-[2.4]):
  - Stock options
  - Use of residence or automobile
  - Health or life insurance coverage
  - Club memberships
• Termination payments (for pre-termination work)

KEY COMMENTARY GUIDANCE:
"Member countries have generally understood benefits in kind
received in respect of employment to be included in 'salaries,
wages or other remuneration' provided the amount was derived
as a result of the exercise of current, ongoing employment or
after the termination of employment, for work done before the
employment was terminated." (Commentary on Article 15(1), [2.1])

NOT COVERED (other articles apply):
• Independent contractor fees → Article 7/14
• Directors' fees → Article 16
• Entertainer/sportsperson fees → Article 17
• Pensions → Article 18
• Government employment → Article 19

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3.4 Where is Employment "Exercised"?

Employment is exercised where the employee is **physically present** when performing the duties for which the employment income is paid.

**Commentary guidance:**
- Focus on physical presence during work
- Remote working creates attribution issues
- Travel days may be attributed to multiple jurisdictions

---

## 4. ARTICLE 15(2): THE 183-DAY EXCEPTION

### 4.1 Overview

Article 15(2) provides an **exception** to the place-of-work principle. Even if employment is exercised in the other state, the remuneration is taxable **only in the residence state** if **all three conditions** are satisfied.

```
THE THREE CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS OF ARTICLE 15(2)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ALL THREE must be met for Article 15(2) to apply:

                    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                    │   Article 15(2)(a)           │
                    │   ≤183 days presence         │
                    │   in source state            │
                    └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                   │ AND
                    ┌──────────────▼───────────────┐
                    │   Article 15(2)(b)           │
                    │   Employer NOT resident      │
                    │   of source state            │
                    └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                   │ AND
                    ┌──────────────▼───────────────┐
                    │   Article 15(2)(c)           │
                    │   Remuneration NOT borne     │
                    │   by PE in source state      │
                    └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                   │
                    ┌──────────────▼───────────────┐
                    │   RESULT:                    │
                    │   Taxable ONLY in            │
                    │   residence state            │
                    └──────────────────────────────┘

IF ANY CONDITION FAILS:
→ Source state may tax under Article 15(1)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.2 Condition (a): The 183-Day Rule

**Text:**
> "the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate **183 days** in any **twelve month period** commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned"

```
183-DAY RULE - KEY POINTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COUNTING DAYS:
• Physical presence in source state counts
• Part-days count as full days (Commentary [5])
• Days need NOT be consecutive
• Aggregate all periods in the 12-month window

THE 12-MONTH PERIOD:
• Any 12-month period commencing OR ending in fiscal year
• Rolling 12-month test
• Not limited to calendar/fiscal year boundaries

EXAM EXAMPLE (June 2023 - Mr Ky):
• Two trips of 35 days + one trip of 70 days = 140 days
• 140 days < 183 days
• Condition (a) SATISFIED

WHAT COUNTS:
✓ Days physically present for work
✓ Day trips (even partial presence)
✓ Arrival and departure days
✓ Days present for any reason (not just work)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4.3 Condition (b): Employer Not Resident of Source State

**Text:**
> "the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an **employer who is not a resident** of the other State"

**Purpose:** Grant taxing rights to the state that recognises the cost of remuneration as a deduction from taxable profits (Commentary [6.2]).

**Key Issues:**
- Who is the "employer"?
- Formal employer vs economic employer
- "Paid by, or on behalf of" interpretation

### 4.4 Condition (c): Remuneration Not Borne by PE

**Text:**
> "the remuneration is **not borne by a permanent establishment** which the employer has in the other State"

**Purpose:** If employer has PE in source state that bears the cost, source state should have taxing rights.

**"Borne by" interpretation:**
- Need not be actually charged to PE's profit and loss
- If remuneration **ought to be** borne by PE, condition fails
- Look at whether PE is economic employer (Commentary [8.14])

---

## 5. THE ECONOMIC EMPLOYER CONCEPT

### 5.1 Critical Exam Topic

The June 2023 exam extensively tested the economic employer concept. This is where the **formal employer** (legal contract) may differ from the **economic employer** (substance).

### 5.2 OECD Commentary Approach

**Commentary on Article 15(2), [8.14]:**
> "The whole context of the employment should be reviewed to determine which entity is the 'economic employer'"

```
ECONOMIC EMPLOYER - SUBSTANCE OVER FORM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FORMAL EMPLOYER:                 ECONOMIC EMPLOYER:
────────────────────────         ────────────────────────
• Employment contract            • Bears risk/responsibility
• Pays salary                    • Controls the work
• Issues payslip                 • Integrates employee
• Legal relationship             • Substantive relationship

OECD TWO-STEP TEST:

STEP 1: NATURE OF SERVICES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• How integrated is the employee in the host entity's business?
• Does the employee bear entrepreneurial risk?
• Who benefits from the services?

STEP 2: CONTROL FACTORS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Who has authority to instruct the employee?
• Who controls where work is performed?
• Who provides tools and materials?
• Who determines work schedule and holidays?
• Who can select/dismiss the employee?
• Who can impose disciplinary sanctions?
• Are costs recharged to host entity?

KEY INDICATOR (Commentary [8.15]):
Direct charging of payments to another enterprise for services
provided by the individual is RELEVANT when considering whether
an employment relationship exists with that other enterprise.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 5.3 Commentary Examples

**Example 3 (Commentary [8.21]) - Secondments in Group Companies:**
- Employee seconded from Company A (State R) to Company B (State S)
- Analysis focuses on integration and control
- Key: Which entity bears risk/responsibility for results?

**Example 6 (Commentary [8.26]) - Manager in Group Companies:**
- Manager performs services for multiple group companies
- Consider function's integral nature to each business
- Employment relationship follows substantive control

### 5.4 June 2023 Exam Application (Mr Ky)

From the suggested solution:
> "The Commentary on Article 15(1) prescribes a 'substance over form' approach whereby the whole context of the employment should be reviewed to determine which entity is the 'economic employer'... Central to this approach is the identification of which entity bears the responsibility or risk for the results produced by the individual's work."

**Factors considered:**
- DynaCorp (Home Country) had employment contract with Mr Ky
- DynaCorp "required" Mr Ky to make trips to Country A
- DynaCorp paid salary and bonus
- No charging arrangement between DynaCorp and AlphaCorp
- **Conclusion:** DynaCorp was employer for Article 15(2)(b)

---

## 6. ARTICLE 15(3): SHIP AND AIRCRAFT CREW

### 6.1 The Rule

> "remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised **aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic**... may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the **place of effective management** of the enterprise is situated"

### 6.2 Rationale

- Ship/aircraft crew work in multiple jurisdictions
- POEM provides stable connecting factor
- Aligns with Article 8 (shipping/air transport profits)

### 6.3 Scope

```
ARTICLE 15(3) - SHIP/AIRCRAFT CREW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

APPLIES TO:
• Employment aboard ship in international traffic
• Employment aboard aircraft in international traffic
• Employment aboard boat in inland waterways transport

TAXING RIGHT:
• POEM state of the operating enterprise MAY tax
• Residence state also has taxing rights
• Double taxation relief under Article 23

KEY TERM: "Regular complement"
• Crew members regularly employed on the vessel/aircraft
• Not passengers or occasional workers

JUNE 2023 EXAM:
"Mr Ky is a senior procurement specialist for DynaCorp and
therefore Article 15(3) is not further considered here."
→ Article 15(3) only for crew members

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## 7. UN MODEL DIFFERENCES

### 7.1 Current Position

The UN Model Article 15 is substantially similar to the OECD Model, with minor drafting variations.

### 7.2 Proposed UN Article 15(4) - Remote Workers (2023-2024)

The UN Committee of Experts has proposed an additional paragraph for remote workers:

```
UN PROPOSED ARTICLE 15(4) - REMOTE WORKERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUE:
Employee resident in State A works remotely for employer in State B
→ Under traditional rules, only State A can tax (residence)
→ State B (employer's state) has NO taxing rights

UN PROPOSAL:
Grant additional taxing rights to EMPLOYER'S STATE OF RESIDENCE
even if employee never physically worked there

KEY DIFFERENCE:
• OECD: Physical presence determines source taxation
• UN proposal: Employer residence also creates nexus

STATUS: Under consideration (not yet adopted)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## 8. SPECIAL ISSUES

### 8.1 Stock Options

**Commentary on Article 15, [12.2]-[12.5]:**

Stock options generally fall within Article 15 as employment income:
- Grant of option → May be taxable event
- Exercise of option → Typically Article 15
- Sale of underlying shares → May be Article 13 (capital gains)

**Key question:** Where was employment exercised during relevant period?

### 8.2 Termination Payments

Termination payments for work done before employment ended fall within Article 15. Attribution depends on where employment was exercised during the relevant period.

### 8.3 Cross-Border Employment Scenarios

| Scenario | Analysis |
|----------|----------|
| **Short-term assignment (<183 days)** | Apply Article 15(2) - all three conditions |
| **Long-term secondment (>183 days)** | Article 15(1) - source state may tax |
| **Multiple employers** | Consider economic employer for each |
| **Group company assignment** | Substance over form analysis |
| **Remote working** | Employment exercised where employee physically present |

---

## 9. EXAM APPLICATION

### 9.1 How Article 15 Appears in Exams

Article 15 typically appears in:
1. **Comprehensive scenario questions** - Like June 2023 Mr Ky
2. **Short-term assignment analysis** - Apply all three conditions
3. **Economic employer questions** - Who is the employer?
4. **Interaction with other articles** - Articles 16-19, Article 21
5. **Stock option taxation** - Attribution of income

### 9.2 Answer Framework

```
ARTICLE 15 EXAM FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. CHARACTERISE THE INCOME (2-3 marks)
   "The income (salary/bonus/etc.) appears to be employment income
    under Article 15 because..."
   - Employee relationship exists
   - Not covered by Articles 16-19 (lex specialis)
   - If not employment income → Consider Article 21

2. IDENTIFY RESIDENCE STATE (2 marks)
   "X is resident of State A for purposes of the DTA..."
   (Apply Article 4 if dual residence)

3. WHERE IS EMPLOYMENT EXERCISED? (2-3 marks)
   "The employment is exercised in State B because..."
   - Physical presence during work
   - If only in residence state → Article 15(1) first sentence
   - If in other state → Continue analysis

4. APPLY ARTICLE 15(1) (3-4 marks)
   "Under Article 15(1), State B may tax the remuneration
    derived from employment exercised there..."
   - Both states have taxing rights
   - Double taxation relief under Article 23

5. CONSIDER ARTICLE 15(2) (6-8 marks)
   "However, Article 15(2) may exclude source taxation if..."

   Condition (a): 183 days
   - Count days of presence in source state
   - Any 12-month period commencing/ending in fiscal year

   Condition (b): Employer not resident
   - Identify the employer (economic employer analysis)
   - Is employer resident of source state?

   Condition (c): Not borne by PE
   - Does employer have PE in source state?
   - Is remuneration borne by that PE?

6. CONCLUSION (2-3 marks)
   "All three conditions are [satisfied/not satisfied]..."
   - If ALL met → Residence state only
   - If ANY fails → Source state may tax

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 9.3 Common Exam Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Applying only 183-day rule | Must satisfy ALL THREE conditions |
| Ignoring economic employer | Use substance over form analysis |
| Confusing residence of employee vs employer | 15(2)(b) refers to employer's residence |
| Missing lex specialis articles | Check Articles 16-19 first |
| Wrong 183-day calculation | Part-days count; any 12-month period |

---

## 10. SUMMARY: KEY POINTS FOR EXAM

```
