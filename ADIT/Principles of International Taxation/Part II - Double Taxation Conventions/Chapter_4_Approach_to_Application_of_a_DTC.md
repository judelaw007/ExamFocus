## 1. INTRODUCTION: WHY THIS TOPIC MATTERS

Understanding how to apply a DTC to a concrete scenario is the single most important practical skill tested in the ADIT Principles of International Taxation exam. Unlike theoretical knowledge that can be memorised, this skill requires systematic application of a structured methodology to determine which country can tax what income, and how double taxation is relieved.

The OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD MTC) and UN Model Double Taxation Convention (UN MDTC) provide the framework for over 3,000 bilateral tax treaties globally. When a cross-border transaction occurs, the tax practitioner must navigate through the treaty provisions systematically to determine the tax treatment. The examiners consistently test this analytical skill through scenario-based questions that require candidates to work through the treaty articles in the correct sequence.

## 2. THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH: STEP-BY-STEP METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Overview of the Application Sequence

When applying a DTC to any cross-border scenario, follow this **mandatory sequence**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         DTC APPLICATION METHODOLOGY - 6-STEP FRAMEWORK          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 1: Is the DTC in force and applicable?                   │
│     ↓    (Articles 30-32: Entry into force, termination)       │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 2: Is the taxpayer a "person" covered by the DTC?        │
│     ↓    (Article 1: Persons covered + Article 3: Definitions) │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 3: Is the tax covered by the DTC?                        │
│     ↓    (Article 2: Taxes covered)                            │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 4: Is the person a "resident" for treaty purposes?       │
│     ↓    (Article 4: Residence + tie-breaker if dual resident) │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 5: Which distributive rule applies to allocate taxing    │
│     ↓    rights? (Articles 6-22)                               │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 6: How is double taxation eliminated?                    │
│          (Articles 23A/23B: Exemption or Credit method)        │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This sequence reflects the logical structure of the OECD MTC itself. The treaty first establishes its scope (who is covered, what taxes apply), then allocates taxing rights through distributive rules, and finally provides relief mechanisms.

### 2.2 Understanding Why the Sequence Matters

The sequence is not arbitrary—each step depends on the conclusions from previous steps:

| Step | If Answer is "No" | Consequence |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1. DTC in force? | Treaty does not apply | Domestic law only governs |
| 2. Person covered? | Treaty does not apply to that person | Domestic law only governs |
| 3. Tax covered? | Treaty does not cover that tax | Domestic law applies to that tax |
| 4. Resident? | Treaty benefits generally unavailable | Must apply tie-breaker if dual resident |
| 5. Distributive rule? | Default to Article 21 (Other income) | Residence state typically has exclusive right |
| 6. Relief method? | Depends on treaty/domestic law | Credit or exemption as applicable |

---

## 3. DETAILED ANALYSIS OF EACH STEP

### STEP 1: Is the DTC in Force and Applicable?

**Relevant Articles**: Articles 30, 31, 32 OECD MTC (Articles 30, 31 UN MDTC)

Before analysing the substantive provisions, confirm:
- **Entry into force** (Article 30/31): Has the treaty entered into force? Most treaties require ratification/exchange of instruments.
- **Temporal scope**: Does the treaty apply to the tax year in question? Treaties typically apply to taxes withheld at source from a specified date and to other taxes for tax years beginning after a specified date.
- **Territorial extension** (Article 30 OECD MTC): Does the treaty extend to any territories beyond the main jurisdiction?
- **Termination** (Article 32/31): Has either state terminated the treaty?

**Exam Tip**: In exam scenarios, the treaty is almost always assumed to be in force unless stated otherwise. However, briefly acknowledging this step demonstrates thoroughness.

---

### STEP 2: Is the Taxpayer a "Person" Covered?

**Relevant Articles**: Article 1 (Persons covered) + Article 3 (General definitions)

**Article 1(1)** provides: *"This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States."*

**Article 3(1)(a)** defines "person" to include:
- An individual
- A company
- Any other body of persons

| Entity Type | Treaty Coverage |
|-------------|----------------|
| Individual natural persons | ✓ Covered |
| Companies (corporations) | ✓ Covered |
| Partnerships | Depends on domestic law characterisation |
| Trusts | Depends on domestic law characterisation |
| Fiscally transparent entities | Complex—see Article 1(2) |
| Governments, subdivisions | May be covered as "persons" |

**Article 1(2)** (post-BEPS): Addresses fiscally transparent entities—income derived by or through such entities is considered income of a resident only to the extent the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income of a resident.

**Article 1(3)**: Confirms that the Convention shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its own residents (subject to specific exceptions like Articles 7(3), 9(2), 23A, 23B, 24).

**Exam Application**: When presented with a scenario, first identify:
1. What type of entity/person is involved?
2. Are they resident in one or both Contracting States?

---

### STEP 3: Is the Tax Covered?

**Relevant Article**: Article 2 (Taxes covered)

**Article 2(1)** provides that the Convention applies to *"taxes on income and on capital"*.

**Article 2(2)** states these are *"all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital, or on elements of income or of capital"*, including taxes on:
- Gains from alienation of property
- Taxes on wages or salaries paid by enterprises
- Taxes on capital appreciation

**Article 2(3)** lists the specific taxes covered for each Contracting State (this varies by treaty).

**Article 2(4)** provides that the Convention also applies to *"any identical or substantially similar taxes"* imposed after the date of signature.

| Tax Type | Generally Covered? |
|----------|-------------------|
| Income tax | ✓ Yes |
| Corporation tax | ✓ Yes |
| Capital gains tax | ✓ Yes |
| Withholding taxes | ✓ Yes |
| Social security contributions | Usually not (but check specific treaties) |
| VAT/GST | ✗ No |
| Stamp duties | ✗ Generally no |
| Inheritance/gift taxes | ✗ No (separate conventions exist) |

**Important Exception—Article 24(6)**: The non-discrimination article applies to *"taxes of every kind and description"*, not just those covered by Article 2.

---

### STEP 4: Is the Person a "Resident" for Treaty Purposes?

**Relevant Article**: Article 4 (Resident)

This is often the most critical step in treaty analysis. A person must be a "resident" of at least one Contracting State to access treaty benefits.

#### 4.1 Definition of Resident

**Article 4(1)** defines "resident of a Contracting State" as *"any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature"*.

The definition:
- References **domestic law** of each State
- Requires **liability to tax** (not merely potential liability)
- Lists connecting factors: domicile, residence, place of management, etc.

**Exclusions**: Does NOT include persons liable to tax only on income from sources in that State or capital situated therein.

#### 4.2 Tie-Breaker Rules for Dual Residents

When a person is resident in both Contracting States under their respective domestic laws, the **tie-breaker rules** determine residence for treaty purposes:

**For Individuals—Article 4(2)**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           TIE-BREAKER CASCADE FOR INDIVIDUALS                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  Test 1: PERMANENT HOME                                         │
│          → Resident of State where permanent home is available  │
│          → If permanent home in both States, proceed to Test 2  │
│                           ↓                                     │
│  Test 2: CENTRE OF VITAL INTERESTS                             │
│          → Resident of State with closer personal & economic    │
│            relations                                            │
│          → If centre cannot be determined, proceed to Test 3    │
│                           ↓                                     │
│  Test 3: HABITUAL ABODE                                        │
│          → Resident of State where habitual abode exists        │
│          → If habitual abode in both/neither, proceed to Test 4 │
│                           ↓                                     │
│  Test 4: NATIONALITY                                           │
│          → Resident of State of which person is a national      │
│          → If national of both/neither, proceed to MAP          │
│                           ↓                                     │
│  Test 5: MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE                            │
│          → Competent authorities settle by mutual agreement     │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**For Companies/Entities—Article 4(3)**:

The 2017 OECD MTC introduced significant changes:
- **Pre-2017**: Dual-resident entities were resident where their "place of effective management" (POEM) was situated
- **Post-2017**: Competent authorities shall determine by mutual agreement, having regard to:
  - Place of effective management
  - Place of incorporation or constitution
  - Any other relevant factors

If no agreement is reached, the entity is not entitled to treaty benefits except as agreed by competent authorities.

**Exam Tip**: When a scenario involves potential dual residence, systematically work through each tie-breaker test, citing the relevant article paragraph and applying the facts.

---

### STEP 5: Which Distributive Rule Applies?

**Relevant Articles**: Articles 6-22 OECD MTC

The "distributive rules" (also called "allocative rules") determine which Contracting State(s) may tax specific types of income or capital. This is the core analytical step in treaty application.

#### 5.1 Structure of Distributive Rules

The distributive rules follow a consistent pattern:

| Type of Income/Capital | Article | Taxing Rights Allocation |
|------------------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Income from immovable property** | Art. 6 | Source state MAY tax (open rule) |
| **Business profits** | Art. 7 | Residence state; Source state only if PE |
| **Shipping/air transport** | Art. 8 | POEM state has exclusive right |
| **Associated enterprises** | Art. 9 | Adjustment provisions |
| **Dividends** | Art. 10 | Both may tax; Source limited to 5%/15% |
| **Interest** | Art. 11 | Both may tax; Source limited (usually 10%) |
| **Royalties** | Art. 12 | Residence state only (OECD); Source may tax (UN) |
| **Capital gains** | Art. 13 | Depends on asset type |
| **Independent personal services** | Art. 14 | Deleted from OECD; retained in UN |
| **Employment income** | Art. 15 | Generally where employment exercised |
| **Directors' fees** | Art. 16 | State where company is resident |
| **Entertainers/sportspersons** | Art. 17 | State where activities performed |
| **Pensions** | Art. 18 | Residence state (OECD); variations exist |
| **Government service** | Art. 19 | Paying state (generally) |
| **Students** | Art. 20 | Exempt in study state (if from abroad) |
| **Other income** | Art. 21 | Residence state (exclusive) |
| **Capital (wealth)** | Art. 22 | Depends on asset type |

#### 5.2 Understanding "May Tax" vs "Shall Be Taxable Only"

The language of distributive rules is critical:

| Treaty Language | Meaning | Example |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| "may be taxed" or "may tax" | The State HAS THE RIGHT to tax but is not obliged to | "Income from immovable property... **may be taxed** in that other State" (Art. 6) |
| "shall be taxable only" | EXCLUSIVE taxing right—other State must not tax | "Profits of an enterprise... **shall be taxable only** in that State" (Art. 7(1)) |
| "may also be taxed" | Source state ALSO has the right (in addition to residence state) | Dividends "**may also be taxed** in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident" (Art. 10(2)) |

**Critical Understanding**: "May be taxed" does NOT mean "must be taxed"—it merely permits taxation. The State must still have a domestic law basis to actually impose the tax.

#### 5.3 Priority Rules Between Distributive Articles

When income could potentially fall under multiple articles, **priority rules** determine which article takes precedence:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              PRIORITY RULES - KEY RELATIONSHIPS                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  Article 6 (Immovable property) takes priority over:           │
│  → Article 7 (Business profits) - Art. 6(4) explicitly states  │
│  → Article 21 (Other income) - Art. 21(2)                      │
│                                                                 │
│  Article 7 (Business profits) is subject to:                   │
│  → Articles 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 21 - Art. 7(4)         │
│                                                                 │
│  Articles 10, 11, 12 (Investment income) give way if:          │
│  → Income effectively connected to PE (Art. 10(4), 11(4), 12(3))│
│  → In which case Article 7 applies                             │
│                                                                 │
│  Article 21 (Other income) is residual:                        │
│  → Applies only if no other article covers the income          │
│  → Subject to Article 6 and 7 priority rules                   │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example—December 2023 Exam Q6**: The suggested solution illustrates this methodology when analysing whether rental income fell under Article 6 (immovable property), Article 7 (business profits), or Article 21 (other income). The analysis correctly noted that Article 6 takes priority, and only if income doesn't have the requisite nexus to immovable property would Article 21 potentially apply.

#### 5.4 The PE Threshold in Distributive Rules

Many distributive rules hinge on whether a **Permanent Establishment (PE)** exists:

| If PE EXISTS in Source State | If NO PE in Source State |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Art. 7: Source state may tax profits attributable to PE | Art. 7: Residence state has exclusive taxing right |
| Art. 10(4): Dividends taxed as business profits if effectively connected to PE | Art. 10: Dividends taxed per Art. 10(2) limits |
| Art. 11(4): Interest taxed as business profits if effectively connected to PE | Art. 11: Interest taxed per Art. 11(2) limits |
| Art. 12(3): Royalties taxed as business profits if effectively connected to PE | Art. 12: Residence state only (OECD MTC) |

---

### STEP 6: How is Double Taxation Eliminated?

**Relevant Articles**: Articles 23A (Exemption method) and 23B (Credit method)

Once the distributive rules have allocated taxing rights, the residence state must provide relief where the source state has taxed.

#### 6.1 The Two Methods

**Article 23A—Exemption Method**:
- Residence state EXEMPTS the income that may be taxed by source state
- Often "exemption with progression"—exempt income may be considered for determining the tax rate on other income
- Used by countries like Netherlands, Belgium, France (for certain income)

**Article 23B—Credit Method**:
- Residence state ALLOWS A CREDIT for tax paid in source state
- Credit limited to residence state tax attributable to that income
- Used by countries like UK, USA, Japan

| Feature | Exemption Method | Credit Method |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Income excluded from tax base | Tax paid abroad deducted from domestic tax |
| **Tax rate** | Source state rate applies | Higher of source/residence rate applies |
| **Administration** | Simpler—no foreign tax calculation needed | Requires tracking foreign tax paid |
| **Capital Export Neutrality** | ✗ No—incentivises investment in low-tax states | ✓ Yes—same total tax regardless of location |
| **Capital Import Neutrality** | ✓ Yes—all investors taxed same in source state | ✗ No—tax depends on residence state |

#### 6.2 Practical Application

**Exemption Method Example**:
- Resident of State A earns 100,000 income
- 40,000 is from immovable property in State B (taxed there at 25% = 10,000)
- State A exempts the 40,000 but uses it to calculate the rate on 60,000
- If State A's progressive rate on 100,000 would be 35%, that rate applies to 60,000

**Credit Method Example**:
- Same facts as above
- State A taxes all 100,000 at 35% = 35,000
- State A allows credit for State B tax of 10,000
- Net State A tax = 25,000
- Total tax = 10,000 (State B) + 25,000 (State A) = 35,000

### 4.2 Worked Example 1: Employment Income Across Borders

**Scenario**: Maria, resident of Country X, is employed by XCo (also resident of Country X). In 2024, Maria is assigned to work in Country Y for 150 days. XCo pays Maria's salary of $100,000. Countries X and Y have a DTC based on the OECD MTC.

**Analysis**:

**Step 1—DTC in force**: Assume the X-Y DTC is in force (exam scenario).

**Step 2—Person covered**: Maria is an individual (Article 3(1)(a)), a "person" covered by Article 1.

**Step 3—Tax covered**: Income tax on employment income is covered (Article 2).

**Step 4—Residence**: Maria is resident of Country X under domestic law. No indication of dual residence.

**Step 5—Distributive Rule**: Employment income—Article 15 applies.

**Article 15(1)**: Salaries and wages "shall be taxable only in [residence State]" UNLESS employment is exercised in the other State. If exercised in Country Y, Country Y "may also tax".

**Article 15(2)** Exception (the "183-day rule"): Despite Article 15(1), Country X has exclusive right to tax if ALL three conditions are met:
1. Maria is present in Country Y for ≤183 days in any 12-month period ✓ (150 days)
2. Remuneration is paid by employer NOT resident in Country Y ✓ (XCo is X resident)
3. Remuneration is NOT borne by PE in Country Y ✓ (no PE mentioned)

**Conclusion**: All three conditions of Article 15(2) are satisfied. Country X has the exclusive right to tax Maria's employment income. Country Y cannot tax.

### 4.3 Worked Example 2: Income from Immovable Property

**Scenario**: Beta Ltd, resident of State A, owns a warehouse in State B which it rents out for $200,000 per year. State B imposes a 20% tax on rental income. States A and B have a DTC based on the OECD MTC. State A uses the credit method.

**Analysis**:

**Step 1-4**: DTC in force; Beta Ltd is a "company" (person covered); taxes covered; Beta Ltd resident of State A.

**Step 5—Distributive Rule**: Income from letting immovable property—Article 6 applies.

**Article 6(1)**: Income from immovable property "may be taxed" in the State where the property is situated (State B).

**Article 6(3)**: Applies to income from "direct use, letting, or use in any other form" of immovable property.

**Article 6(4)**: Also applies to income from immovable property of an enterprise.

**Result**: State B has the right to tax the rental income. It exercises this right: Tax = $200,000 × 20% = $40,000.

State A, as residence state, also has the right to tax (Article 6 is an "open" rule—both states may tax).

**Step 6—Relief**: Treaty uses credit method (Article 23B).
- State A taxes the $200,000 at its rate (assume 25% = $50,000)
- State A allows credit for State B tax of $40,000
- State A net tax = $50,000 - $40,000 = $10,000
- Total tax burden = $40,000 + $10,000 = $50,000

### 4.4 Worked Example 3: Characterisation Issues—Article Priority

**Scenario**: Delta Inc, resident of Country P, provides consulting services to clients in Country Q through a small office maintained in Country Q. Delta Inc also owns a building in Country Q which generates $50,000 rental income and is used 20% as the office and 80% rented to third parties.

**Analysis**:

This scenario involves **characterisation** issues:
- Is the rental income taxable under Article 6 (immovable property)?
- Is it taxable under Article 7 (business profits) because of the PE?
- How does the mixed-use affect the analysis?

**Article 6(4)** explicitly states that Article 6(1) and (3) apply to "income from immovable property of an enterprise". This means Article 6 takes priority over Article 7 for rental income.

**Commentary guidance**: The 80% rented portion clearly falls under Article 6—Country Q may tax this income ($40,000) as income from immovable property.

The 20% office portion: If Delta Inc operates a PE through the office, business profits attributable to that PE would fall under Article 7. But the "rental equivalent" or imputed income from self-use does not generate taxable income under Article 6.

**Conclusion**:
- $40,000 rental income: Article 6—Country Q may tax
- Business profits from PE activities: Article 7—Country Q may tax to extent attributable to PE
- Country P provides relief per Article 23A or 23B

## 5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN DTC APPLICATION

### 5.1 The Role of OECD Commentaries

The OECD Commentaries provide authoritative guidance on interpreting the OECD MTC. Key points:

- **Ambulatory vs Static interpretation**: Courts differ on whether to use Commentaries existing at treaty conclusion (static) or at time of application (ambulatory)
- **Article 3(2)**: Undefined terms take meaning from domestic law "unless the context otherwise requires"—Commentaries inform "context"
- **Persuasive authority**: Not legally binding but widely followed by courts and tax authorities

### 5.2 Anti-Avoidance Considerations

Post-BEPS, additional steps may be required:

**Article 29 (Entitlement to Benefits)**:
- **Principal Purpose Test (PPT)**: Benefits denied if obtaining them was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement
- **Limitation on Benefits (LOB)**: Detailed objective tests for treaty entitlement
- **Simplified LOB**: Combined with PPT in some treaties

**Beneficial Ownership**: For Articles 10-12, the recipient must be the "beneficial owner" of dividends, interest, or royalties to claim reduced rates.

│  • Treaties LIMIT but do not CREATE taxing rights              │

│  • Treaties cannot INCREASE domestic law taxation              │
│    - If domestic law doesn't tax, treaty cannot impose tax     │
│                                                                 │

## 7. ERROR PREVENTION CHECKLIST

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Common Error | Prevention Strategy |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Jumping straight to distributive rules without checking residence | ALWAYS confirm residence status first |
| Applying wrong article (e.g., Art. 7 instead of Art. 6 for rental income) | Check priority rules systematically |
| Forgetting the PE threshold in Art. 7, 10, 11, 12 | Ask: "Is there a PE?" for every business scenario |
| Confusing "may tax" with "shall be taxable only" | Note the exact treaty language |
| Applying tie-breaker tests in wrong order | Follow cascade: Home → Centre of vital interests → Habitual abode → Nationality → MAP |
| Not considering anti-avoidance provisions | Post-BEPS questions often require PPT analysis |
| Forgetting to explain relief method | Always conclude with how double taxation is eliminated |
| Applying OECD rules when UN MDTC applies | Check which model the scenario specifies |

---

## 8. DIFFERENCES: OECD MTC vs UN MDTC IN APPLICATION

When applying a DTC, check which model the treaty follows:

| Article | OECD MTC | UN MDTC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Art. 5 (PE) | Higher threshold | Lower threshold (service PE) |
| Art. 7 (Business profits) | AOA approach | Force of attraction alternative |
| Art. 12 (Royalties) | Residence state exclusive | Source state may tax |
| Art. 12A (Technical services) | Not included | Source state may tax |
| Art. 12B (Digital services) | Not included | Source state may tax |
| Art. 14 (Independent services) | Deleted | Retained |

## 9. EXAM TECHNIQUE: TIME ALLOCATION

For a 25-mark DTC scenario question (suggested 45 minutes):

| Component | Time | Marks |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Read and analyse facts | 5 mins | — |
| Structure answer outline | 3 mins | — |
| Steps 1-4 (Scope, Residence) | 8 mins | 5-6 marks |
| Step 5 (Distributive rules) | 15 mins | 12-14 marks |
| Step 6 (Relief method) | 7 mins | 4-5 marks |
| Review and conclusion | 7 mins | 2-3 marks |
