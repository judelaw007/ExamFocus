# Chapter 4: Approach to the Application of a DTC – Applying a DTC to a Concrete Scenario

## 1. Introduction: The Importance of Systematic Treaty Application

Understanding how to apply a double taxation convention to a concrete scenario is perhaps the most important practical skill in international taxation. The OECD Model Tax Convention and UN Model Double Taxation Convention provide the framework for over 3,000 bilateral tax treaties globally. When a cross-border transaction occurs, the tax practitioner must navigate through treaty provisions systematically to determine which country can tax what income and how double taxation is relieved.

This analytical process requires a structured methodology. Unlike domestic tax law where a single legislative framework applies, treaty application involves multiple interacting provisions that must be considered in the correct sequence. Each step in the analysis depends on conclusions from previous steps, meaning that errors at early stages propagate through the entire analysis.

The methodology presented in this chapter reflects the logical structure of the OECD Model itself. The treaty first establishes its scope—determining who is covered and what taxes apply—then allocates taxing rights through distributive rules, and finally provides relief mechanisms to eliminate double taxation. Understanding this structure and applying it systematically is essential for correct treaty analysis. Past examinations have consistently tested this analytical skill through scenario-based questions.

## 2. The Six-Step Methodology

### 2.1. Overview of the Application Sequence

When applying a DTC to any cross-border scenario, the following sequence should be followed:

**Step 1**: Is the DTC in force and applicable? (Articles 30-32)

**Step 2**: Is the taxpayer a "person" covered by the DTC? (Articles 1 and 3)

**Step 3**: Is the tax covered by the DTC? (Article 2)

**Step 4**: Is the person a "resident" for treaty purposes? (Article 4)

**Step 5**: Which distributive rule applies to allocate taxing rights? (Articles 6-22)

**Step 6**: How is double taxation eliminated? (Articles 23A/23B)

### 2.2. The Logic of the Sequence

This sequence is not arbitrary—each step depends on conclusions from previous steps. If the DTC is not in force, subsequent analysis is irrelevant. If the taxpayer is not a "person" covered, treaty benefits are unavailable. If the tax is not covered, the treaty does not apply to that particular charge. If the person is not a "resident," treaty benefits are generally inaccessible. Only after establishing these threshold requirements does the analysis proceed to the substantive allocation of taxing rights through the distributive rules, followed by relief provisions.

The sequence also reflects the treaty's internal logic. Articles 1-4 establish scope and definitions. Articles 6-22 contain the distributive rules allocating taxing rights. Articles 23A and 23B provide relief mechanisms. This structure ensures that the substantive provisions operate on a properly defined foundation of persons, taxes, and residency.

## 3. Establishing Scope (Steps 1-3)

### 3.1. Is the DTC in Force?

Before analysing substantive provisions, one must confirm that the treaty applies to the situation in question. Article 30 addresses entry into force, typically requiring ratification and exchange of instruments. The temporal scope must be verified—treaties usually apply to taxes withheld at source from a specified date and to other taxes for taxable periods beginning after a specified date. Article 32 addresses termination, which either party may invoke with appropriate notice.

In practical terms, most scenarios assume the treaty is in force. However, acknowledging this step demonstrates methodological thoroughness, and in some cases—particularly with recently concluded treaties or those subject to renegotiation—verification may be necessary.

### 3.2. Is the Taxpayer a Person Covered?

Article 1(1) provides that the Convention applies to "persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States." Article 3(1)(a) defines "person" to include an individual, a company, and any other body of persons.

This definition is broad. Individuals are clearly covered. Companies, defined in Article 3(1)(b) as any body corporate or entity treated as a body corporate for tax purposes, are covered. Partnerships, trusts, and other entities present more complexity—their treatment depends on how domestic law characterises them.

Article 1(2), introduced following the BEPS Project, addresses fiscally transparent entities. Income derived by or through such entities is considered income of a resident only to the extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income of a resident. This provision prevents treaty benefits from applying to income that is not actually subject to tax in either Contracting State.

Article 1(3) confirms that the Convention does not affect a Contracting State's right to tax its own residents, subject to specific exceptions including Articles 7(3), 9(2), 23A, 23B, and 24. This "saving clause" preserves domestic taxing jurisdiction over residents.

### 3.3. Is the Tax Covered?

Article 2 defines the taxes to which the Convention applies. Article 2(1) states that the Convention applies to "taxes on income and on capital." Article 2(2) clarifies that these include all taxes imposed on total income, total capital, or elements of income or capital, including taxes on gains from alienation of property.

Article 2(3) lists specific taxes covered for each Contracting State—this varies between treaties. Article 2(4) provides that the Convention also applies to "any identical or substantially similar taxes" imposed after the date of signature, ensuring the treaty remains relevant as tax systems evolve.

Certain taxes are typically not covered: value added taxes, social security contributions (though some treaties include them), stamp duties, and inheritance or gift taxes (separate conventions exist for these). However, Article 24(6) on non-discrimination applies to "taxes of every kind and description," extending beyond Article 2's scope.

## 4. Determining Residence (Step 4)

### 4.1. Definition of Resident

Residence determination is often the most critical step in treaty analysis. A person must be a "resident" of at least one Contracting State to access treaty benefits.

Article 4(1) defines "resident of a Contracting State" as any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of domicile, residence, place of management, or any other criterion of a similar nature. The definition references domestic law of each State and requires liability to tax—not merely potential liability. Importantly, it excludes persons liable to tax only on income from sources in that State or capital situated therein, ensuring that limited fiscal connections do not confer residence status.

### 4.2. Tie-Breaker Rules for Individuals

When an individual qualifies as resident of both Contracting States under their respective domestic laws, Article 4(2) provides tie-breaker rules to determine residence for treaty purposes. These rules apply in a strict hierarchical sequence:

**Test 1—Permanent Home**: The individual is resident where a permanent home is available. If a permanent home is available in both States, proceed to Test 2.

**Test 2—Centre of Vital Interests**: The individual is resident where personal and economic relations are closer. This requires examination of family ties, social connections, occupation, political and cultural activities, and business location. If the centre cannot be determined, proceed to Test 3.

**Test 3—Habitual Abode**: The individual is resident where a habitual abode exists. If a habitual abode exists in both States or neither, proceed to Test 4.

**Test 4—Nationality**: The individual is resident of the State of which they are a national. If a national of both States or neither, proceed to Test 5.

**Test 5—Mutual Agreement Procedure**: The competent authorities shall settle the question by mutual agreement.

The cascade must be followed in sequence. One cannot jump to later tests without first determining that earlier tests are inconclusive.

### 4.3. Tie-Breaker Rules for Entities

Article 4(3) addresses dual residence of entities. The 2017 OECD Model introduced significant changes. Under pre-2017 versions, dual-resident entities were deemed resident where their "place of effective management" was situated. This provided a definitive tie-breaker.

The 2017 version replaced this with competent authority determination. Where a person other than an individual is resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the State of residence for treaty purposes, having regard to place of effective management, place of incorporation or constitution, and any other relevant factors. If no agreement is reached, the entity is not entitled to treaty benefits except as agreed by the competent authorities.

This change reflected concerns that place of effective management was susceptible to manipulation. The UK Upper Tribunal's decision in Haworth v HMRC [2024] illustrates the complexity of applying the place of effective management test, confirming that it is not identical to the "central management and control" test used for determining corporate residence under domestic law—the place of effective management concept is potentially broader, requiring consideration of all circumstances leading to relevant decisions, not merely where decisions were formally taken.

## 5. Applying Distributive Rules (Step 5)

### 5.1. Structure of Distributive Rules

The distributive rules in Articles 6-22 allocate taxing rights between Contracting States for specific types of income and capital. This is the core analytical step in treaty application. The OECD Model addresses income from immovable property (Article 6), business profits (Article 7), shipping and air transport (Article 8), dividends (Article 10), interest (Article 11), royalties (Article 12), capital gains (Article 13), employment income (Article 15), directors' fees (Article 16), entertainers and sportspersons (Article 17), pensions (Article 18), government service (Article 19), students (Article 20), and other income (Article 21).

Each distributive rule follows a consistent analytical structure: it identifies the type of income, specifies which State or States may tax, and sets any applicable limitations. The rules operate as a comprehensive code—every item of income or capital should fall within one (and generally only one) distributive rule.

### 5.2. Treaty Language: "May Tax" Versus "Shall Be Taxable Only"

The precise language of distributive rules carries significant legal meaning, and past examinations have directly tested understanding of these distinctions.

"May be taxed" or "may tax" indicates that the State has the right to tax but is not obliged to do so. This language grants a taxing right without creating a taxing obligation. For example, Article 6(1) provides that income from immovable property "may be taxed" in the State where the property is situated.

"Shall be taxable only" indicates an exclusive taxing right—the other State must refrain from taxation. For example, Article 7(1) provides that business profits "shall be taxable only" in the State of residence unless attributable to a permanent establishment in the other State.

"May also be taxed" indicates that the source State has taxing rights in addition to the residence State. This typically applies to passive income with limited source taxation. For example, Article 10(2) provides that dividends "may also be taxed" in the State of which the paying company is resident, subject to specified rate limits.

Critically, "may be taxed" does not mean "must be taxed." Treaty provisions merely permit taxation—actual imposition requires a domestic law basis in the relevant State.

### 5.3. Priority Rules Between Articles

When income could potentially fall under multiple articles, priority rules determine which prevails. Some priority rules are explicit; others are implicit.

Article 6(4) explicitly provides that income from immovable property of an enterprise falls under Article 6, not Article 7. Article 21(2) confirms that Article 6 also takes priority over Article 21 for income from immovable property.

Article 7(4) provides that business profits that include items of income dealt with separately in other Articles are covered by those other Articles. Thus, if dividends are received by an enterprise, Article 10 applies rather than Article 7—unless the dividends are effectively connected to a permanent establishment, in which case Articles 10(4) and similar provisions redirect to Article 7.

Articles 10(4), 11(4), and 12(3) address the relationship between investment income articles and business profits. Where dividends, interest, or royalties are effectively connected to a permanent establishment through which the recipient carries on business, such income falls under Article 7 rather than the specific investment income article.

Article 21 on other income is explicitly residual—it applies only if no other article covers the income in question.

### 5.4. The Permanent Establishment Threshold

Many distributive rules depend on whether a permanent establishment exists in the source State. This threshold fundamentally affects the allocation of taxing rights.

For business profits under Article 7, the residence State has exclusive taxing rights unless the enterprise carries on business through a permanent establishment in the other State. If a permanent establishment exists, the source State may tax profits attributable to it.

The permanent establishment threshold also affects investment income. Under Articles 10(4), 11(4), and 12(3), if dividends, interest, or royalties are effectively connected to a permanent establishment, the specific investment income articles do not apply and the income is instead taxed as business profits under Article 7.

## 6. Eliminating Double Taxation (Step 6)

### 6.1. The Exemption Method

Article 23A provides the exemption method for eliminating double taxation. Where a resident derives income or owns capital that may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the residence State exempts such income or capital from its tax base.

Most exemption systems operate as "exemption with progression"—the exempt income is considered when determining the tax rate applicable to the resident's remaining income. This preserves progressive rate structures while excluding the exempt income from the tax base.

Countries using the exemption method for various income types include the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. The exemption approach reflects capital import neutrality—all investors in a source State face the same tax burden regardless of their residence State.

### 6.2. The Credit Method

Article 23B provides the credit method. Where a resident derives income that may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the residence State allows a deduction from its tax equal to the tax paid in the source State. The credit is limited to the residence State tax attributable to that income.

Countries primarily using the credit method include the United Kingdom, United States, and Japan. The credit approach reflects capital export neutrality—residents face the same total tax burden regardless of where they invest, ensuring that investment decisions are not distorted by tax considerations.

Comparing the methods: under exemption, the effective tax rate equals the source State rate. Under credit, the effective rate equals the higher of the source or residence State rates. Exemption is administratively simpler but may encourage investment in low-tax jurisdictions. Credit ensures uniform treatment of residents but requires tracking foreign taxes paid.

## 7. Treaty and Domestic Law Interaction

Several fundamental principles govern the relationship between treaty provisions and domestic tax law.

Treaties limit but do not create taxing rights. A treaty provision stating that income "may be taxed" requires domestic law to actually impose the tax. Treaties cannot independently create tax obligations where none exist under domestic law.

Treaties may reduce domestic law taxation. Where domestic law imposes a 30% withholding tax on dividends, a treaty limiting source taxation to 15% reduces the applicable rate. This is the primary relief function of treaties for source-State taxation.

Treaties cannot increase domestic law taxation. If domestic law does not tax certain income, the treaty cannot impose taxation. Treaties are relief mechanisms, not charging provisions.

The interaction also depends on constitutional arrangements. In monist systems, treaties are self-executing and automatically form part of domestic law upon ratification. In dualist systems, implementing legislation is required to give treaties domestic legal effect.

## 8. OECD and UN Model Differences

When applying a DTC, identifying which model underlies the treaty is essential because significant differences affect taxing rights allocation.

Permanent establishment thresholds differ. The UN Model provides lower thresholds, including a services permanent establishment (Article 5(3)(b)) that deems PE to exist if services are furnished through employees present for more than 183 days in any 12-month period—without requiring a fixed place of business.

Royalties treatment differs fundamentally. Under Article 12 of the OECD Model, royalties are taxable only in the residence State. The UN Model permits source-State taxation at negotiated rates.

The UN Model includes provisions absent from the OECD Model. Article 12A permits source taxation of fees for technical services without requiring permanent establishment. Article 12B permits source taxation of income from automated digital services.

Article 14 on independent personal services was deleted from the OECD Model in 2000 but retained in the UN Model, providing an alternative basis for source-State taxation of professional services.

Article 7 on business profits may include a "force of attraction" alternative in UN Model-based treaties, extending source-State taxation to activities identical or similar to those conducted through a permanent establishment even if not attributable to it.

These differences reflect the Models' different orientations—the OECD Model favouring residence-State taxation suited to capital-exporting countries, and the UN Model preserving source-State taxing rights important to capital-importing developing countries.
