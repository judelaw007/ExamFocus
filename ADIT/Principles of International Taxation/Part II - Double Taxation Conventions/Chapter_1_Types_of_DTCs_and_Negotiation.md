# Chapter 1: Types of Double Taxation Conventions and Negotiation Processes

### 1. Introduction to Double Taxation Conventions

#### 1.1. The Bilateral Architecture of International Taxation

The international tax system is characterised by its foundation upon bilateral instruments. The network of bilateral double taxation conventions (DTCs) has evolved from a handful of treaties in the late nineteenth century to over 3,000 bilateral tax treaties currently in force.

This bilateral architecture developed because states preferred individual negotiations preserving sovereignty, different economic relationships required tailored solutions, domestic constitutional requirements varied between states, and trust-building occurred more naturally on a country-by-country basis.

However, this bilateral framework creates inherent challenges including complexity, inconsistency across treaty networks, and difficulties addressing tax issues involving more than two jurisdictions. These limitations have prompted growing consideration of multilateral approaches.

#### 1.2. Fundamental Purposes of Double Taxation Conventions

Double taxation conventions serve several fundamental purposes. The primary purpose is **prevention of juridical double taxation** by allocating taxing rights between jurisdictions and providing relief mechanisms (exemption or credit methods).

These purposes reflect the evolution of international tax policy over the past century. The traditional focus on preventing double taxation emerged from recognition that overlapping tax claims deterred cross-border commerce and investment. However, the more recent emphasis on preventing non-taxation acknowledges a fundamental policy shift: DTCs must balance relief from excessive taxation with prevention of no taxation at all.

A second purpose, formalised in the 2017 OECD Model Tax Convention Preamble, is **prevention of non-taxation** through tax evasion and avoidance. This reflects the post-BEPS evolution acknowledging that DTCs should not create opportunities for double non-taxation.

DTCs also **facilitate international trade and investment** by providing certainty, reducing tax barriers, and creating stable frameworks for business planning. **Administrative cooperation** between tax authorities includes exchange of information, assistance in collection, and simultaneous examinations. Finally, modern DTCs incorporate **anti-avoidance measures** such as the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) and Limitation on Benefits (LOB) provisions.

### 2. Classification of Double Taxation Conventions

Double taxation conventions can be classified according to various criteria, with the most significant distinctions being the number of contracting states and the scope of coverage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This classification matters because the structure of tax agreements fundamentally affects their effectiveness, flexibility, and political feasibility. The choice between bilateral and multilateral approaches reflects deep tensions between national sovereignty and international coordination.

##### 2.1.1. Bilateral Conventions

Bilateral conventions are treaties between two sovereign states establishing rules for allocating taxing rights and providing relief from double taxation. These instruments are individually negotiated based on model conventions, typically following the OECD or UN Model structure.

Bilateral DTCs offer flexibility to address specific bilateral concerns while respecting sovereignty and reflecting different levels of economic development. However, over 3,000 separate instruments create considerable complexity, resulting in inconsistent provisions across treaty networks, opportunities for treaty shopping, and difficulties addressing triangular cases involving more than two states.

##### 2.1.2. Multilateral Conventions

Multilateral conventions involve three or more states and may be either global in scope or regional in application. These instruments represent attempts to address some of the limitations of purely bilateral approaches.

The most significant global multilateral instruments include:

| Instrument | Scope | Focus | Signatories |
|------------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **MLI** (2016) | Global | Modifies bilateral DTCs for BEPS measures | 104+ |
| **MCMAATM** (1988/2010) | Global | Administrative cooperation | 150+ |
| **Nordic Convention** (1996) | Regional | Comprehensive DTC between Nordic states | 5 |
| **Andean Pact Decision 578** | Regional | Tax coordination for Andean Community | 4 |
| **EU Arbitration Convention** | Regional | Transfer pricing dispute resolution | EU members |

The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI) represents a particularly novel approach. Rather than replacing bilateral treaties, the MLI modifies them through a matching mechanism, creating what is termed a "synthesised text" combining the original bilateral treaty with MLI modifications.

#### 2.2. Classification by Scope of Coverage

```

                                           Airlines    Tax Treaties
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The distinction between comprehensive and limited agreements reflects pragmatic considerations. Comprehensive conventions provide certainty across all income types but require substantial negotiation resources and political commitment. Limited agreements permit jurisdictions to cooperate on specific matters—such as information exchange—without the political sensitivity of allocating taxing rights, making them particularly valuable when broader agreement proves impossible.

##### 2.2.1. Comprehensive Conventions

Comprehensive conventions are full-scope treaties covering income and capital taxation, following the complete OECD or UN Model structure. These treaties include scope provisions, definitional articles, distributive rules, methods for relief from double taxation, special provisions such as non-discrimination and mutual agreement procedures, and final provisions. They represent the vast majority of bilateral tax treaties in force.

##### 2.2.2. Limited and Sector-Specific Agreements

Limited conventions address specific aspects of international taxation rather than providing comprehensive coverage.

**Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs)** are based on the OECD Model TIEA developed in 2002. These agreements focus solely on the exchange of tax information between jurisdictions and contain no distributive rules or relief provisions. TIEAs became particularly common with low-tax jurisdictions as part of the international initiative against harmful tax practices.

**Shipping and Air Transport Agreements** are limited to provisions similar to Article 8 of the OECD Model, addressing taxation of profits from international shipping and air transport operations. These agreements address specific industry needs and may exist alongside comprehensive DTCs.

**Inheritance and Estate Tax Treaties** cover succession taxes separately from income taxation. These instruments are less common globally, as many jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated estate taxation.

#### 2.3. Model Tax Conventions and Their Role in Negotiations

Modern bilateral DTCs are almost universally negotiated using model conventions as templates. These models provide standardised structures and language that facilitate negotiations while allowing for country-specific modifications.

| Model | Publisher | Primary Orientation | Key Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **OECD Model** | OECD (1963, updated regularly) | Residence-state bias | Lower source taxation; developed country focus |
| **UN Model** | UN (1980, 2021 latest) | Source-state bias | Greater source taxing rights; developing country focus |
| **US Model** | US Treasury | US-specific | Strong anti-avoidance; specific US provisions |

The **OECD Model Tax Convention**, first published in 1963 and regularly updated, forms the basis of the vast majority of bilateral treaties worldwide. This model serves as the international benchmark for treaty negotiation, interpretation, and application. The OECD Model reflects a residence-state bias, granting primary taxing rights to the state of residence and limiting source-state taxation.

The **UN Model Double Taxation Convention** was developed specifically for use in treaties between developed and developing countries. This model provides stronger source-state taxing rights through various mechanisms, including lower permanent establishment thresholds with specialised provisions for services permanent establishments and insurance permanent establishments, Article 12A addressing Fees for Technical Services, Article 12B covering Automated Digital Services, and generally higher permitted withholding rates for passive income.

The dominance of these model conventions in treaty negotiations has generated discussion in recent years about whether model-based drafting undermines the bilateral nature of tax treaties and the genuine sovereignty of negotiating states, particularly for developing countries with limited technical resources. While models facilitate negotiations and promote consistency, some commentators argue that strict adherence to model provisions may result in treaties that do not fully reflect the specific interests and policy priorities of both contracting states.

### 3. Multilateral Instruments: Operation and Significance

#### 3.1. The BEPS Multilateral Instrument

The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, developed under BEPS Action 15, represents the most significant multilateral development in international taxation. The MLI entered into force on 1 July 2018 and currently has over 104 signatories, modifying nearly 2,000 bilateral treaties.

The MLI represents a revolutionary approach to treaty modification, addressing what would otherwise be an impossible challenge: updating thousands of bilateral treaties to reflect BEPS measures. Without the MLI, countries would face decades of bilateral renegotiations. However, this innovation comes at the cost of significant interpretive complexity.

               "SYNTHESISED TEXT"
               (Original DTC + MLI modifications)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The MLI operates through a sophisticated matching mechanism. When countries sign the MLI, they designate which of their existing bilateral treaties will be **Covered Tax Agreements (CTAs)**. For any bilateral treaty to be modified by the MLI, both parties to that treaty must list it as a CTA and make compatible choices regarding which MLI provisions will apply.

The MLI contains several categories of provisions. **Minimum standards** (Articles 6, 7, and 16) are mandatory for all signatories and address the treaty preamble, prevention of treaty abuse through the Principal Purpose Test or equivalent provisions, and improvements to mutual agreement procedures. **Optional provisions** allow signatories to choose which additional measures to adopt, such as transparent entities, dual residency, and various anti-avoidance rules. **Reservations and notifications** permit countries to opt out of certain provisions or specify how provisions will apply to their CTAs.

The concept of **reservations** deserves particular attention. Signatories may enter reservations to preserve existing bilateral treaty provisions rather than having them modified by the MLI. For example, a country might reserve the right not to apply certain MLI provisions to treaties already containing equivalent measures. These reservations add flexibility but also complexity, as each bilateral relationship under the MLI must be analysed to determine which provisions actually apply.

The result is a **synthesised text**—the combination of the original bilateral treaty and the applicable MLI modifications. This synthesised text must be construed to understand the operative provisions between any two MLI signatories. The OECD provides an online tool to assist in determining how the MLI affects specific bilateral treaties.

One notable limitation is that the United States has not signed the MLI, leaving a significant gap in global coverage. The MLI also addresses only treaty-related BEPS measures and does not modify the fundamental distributive rules of bilateral treaties.

#### 3.2. Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters

The **Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MCMAATM)**, jointly developed by the OECD and Council of Europe, serves as the primary global instrument for administrative cooperation in tax matters. With over 150 participating jurisdictions, the Convention provides a comprehensive framework for international tax cooperation.

The MCMAATM facilitates multiple forms of administrative assistance: exchange of information in all forms (on request, spontaneous, and automatic), simultaneous tax examinations enabling coordinated audits, service of documents across borders, assistance in the collection of tax debts, and joint audits between tax authorities of different jurisdictions.

This framework addresses a critical limitation of bilateral DTCs: administrative cooperation provisions in thousands of separate treaties create inconsistent standards and gaps in coverage. The MCMAATM provides a single, comprehensive legal basis enabling tax authorities to cooperate effectively regardless of whether bilateral DTCs exist or contain adequate cooperation provisions.

This Convention provides the legal foundation for implementing key global transparency initiatives, including the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) for automatic exchange of financial account information, Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) under BEPS Action 13, and automatic exchange of rulings under BEPS Action 5.

#### 3.3. Regional Multilateral Instruments

Several regional multilateral instruments provide models for more geographically limited cooperation.

The **Nordic Convention on Income and Capital** (1996), concluded between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the Faroe Islands, functions as a comprehensive multilateral DTC for the Nordic region. Sometimes described as a hybrid instrument, it operates as a single comprehensive framework while preserving certain bilateral relationships between the parties.

**Andean Pact Decision 578** (2004) establishes tax coordination among Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This instrument adopts source-based taxation principles among member states, reflecting developing country priorities for preserving source taxation rights.

The **EU Arbitration Convention** (1990) provides for mandatory arbitration of transfer pricing disputes between EU member states. This convention served as a model for subsequent developments in arbitration provisions, including those incorporated into the OECD Model through BEPS Action 14.

#### 4.1. The Treaty Negotiation Process

Treaty negotiation follows a structured process involving multiple phases over periods that may extend for several years.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The **pre-negotiation phase** involves policy decisions about whether a treaty serves national interests, requiring economic cost-benefit analysis. Countries select a model convention as base, identify necessary modifications, and assemble negotiating teams.

These pre-negotiation decisions carry enormous significance. The choice between OECD and UN Models, for example, fundamentally affects the balance of taxing rights. Developing countries often lack the analytical resources to conduct rigorous cost-benefit analysis, potentially entering negotiations at a significant informational disadvantage.

During **active negotiation**, parties exchange draft texts and engage in multiple rounds of article-by-article negotiations, resolving differences through compromise and recording agreements in protocols or memoranda.

The **conclusion phase** begins with initialling the agreed text, followed by legal review, translation, formal signature, domestic ratification procedures, and exchange of instruments of ratification for entry into force.

Treaty relationships require **ongoing management** through periodic review and updating via protocol negotiations that often prove as lengthy as original negotiations.

#### 4.2. International Guidance for Treaty Negotiation

Several international organisations provide guidance for treaty negotiations, particularly targeting developing countries.

The **UN Manual for the Negotiation of Bilateral Tax Treaties** offers practical negotiation strategies, detailed explanations of key provisions, and emphasises protecting source-state taxing rights.

The **Platform for Collaboration on Tax** (IMF, OECD, UN, World Bank) provides capacity-building support through toolkits addressing benefit-cost analysis and frameworks for evaluating whether proposed treaties serve national interests.

Key guidance emphasises that negotiators must exercise care when defining terms, consider economic impacts of each provision, ensure domestic implementation capacity, and conduct rigorous analysis of whether treaties provide genuine reciprocity.

#### 4.3. Practical Challenges in Treaty Negotiation

Treaty negotiation presents numerous practical challenges, particularly for developing countries.

| Challenge | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Asymmetric bargaining power** | Developed countries often have greater negotiating capacity and expertise |
| **Revenue implications** | Developing countries may cede valuable taxing rights |
| **Technical complexity** | Requires specialised expertise many countries lack |
| **Time and resources** | Negotiations can take years; significant staff commitment |
| **Domestic law alignment** | Treaty provisions must work within existing domestic frameworks |
| **Model convention bias** | OECD Model favours residence states; UN Model may not fully address all concerns |

**Asymmetric bargaining power** arises when developed countries maintain larger, more experienced negotiating teams while developing countries have limited expertise. **Revenue implications** require careful analysis, as treaties may reduce tax collection for capital-importing states without equivalent reciprocal benefits. The IMF has noted instances where developing countries negotiated treaties contrary to their economic interests. **Technical complexity** demands specialised knowledge spanning domestic tax law, international tax principles, and treaty interpretation. **Time and resource requirements** create constraints, with negotiations often extending over multiple years.

### 5. The Bilateral-Multilateral Debate in International Taxation

The tension between bilateral and multilateral approaches to international tax agreements has intensified in recent years as the international tax system addresses increasingly complex global challenges.

#### 5.1. The Case for Multilateral Tax Agreements

Advocates for multilateral tax agreements advance several compelling arguments.

**Complexity reduction**: The current system of over 3,000 bilateral treaties creates enormous complexity. A multilateral agreement could reduce this to a single instrument or significantly fewer instruments with standardised regulations facilitating compliance.

**Addressing systemic challenges**: Multilateral approaches can eliminate treaty shopping opportunities, resolve triangular cases involving multiple jurisdictions that bilateral treaties cannot address, and create a level playing field for smaller economies.

**Efficiency gains**: Countries would not need to negotiate thousands of individual bilateral relationships. Amendments could be implemented more quickly once consensus is reached, and coordinated approaches become possible for global challenges such as taxation of the digitalised economy.

**Practical benefits**: Single documents are easier to access and reference. Common interpretation might develop more readily, reducing uncertainty and decreasing administrative and compliance costs.

#### 5.2. Challenges and Limitations of Multilateral Approaches

Despite potential benefits, multilateral approaches face substantial challenges.

**Sovereignty concerns** remain paramount. Tax policy represents a core aspect of national sovereignty, and states resist ceding control to multilateral frameworks. Countries value the ability to use tax incentives strategically in international competition.

**Negotiation challenges**: Achieving consensus among many states with diverse interests proves extremely difficult. The MLI experience demonstrates that accommodating diversity requires numerous options and reservations, reintroducing complexity. Lengthy negotiation processes may produce outdated provisions by implementation. Concerns arise about dominant countries exercising undue influence.

**Practical limitations**: Reduced flexibility for bespoke solutions, potential resistance from large economies that value bilateral leverage, and confidential negotiations that may erode taxpayer trust.

**MLI-specific concerns**: Rather than simplifying the system, the MLI creates an additional analytical layer. The United States' non-participation leaves a major gap. The MLI addresses only certain anti-avoidance provisions, not fundamental distributive rules. Various options and reservations may paradoxically create new planning opportunities.

#### 5.3. Contemporary Developments and Trends

The international tax landscape shows clear evidence of movement towards multilateralism while bilateral instruments remain foundational.

The **OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS** represents a significant multilateral development with over 140 member jurisdictions participating in developing international tax standards. This Framework demonstrates unprecedented levels of international tax cooperation.

The **Two-Pillar Solution** to address tax challenges of digitalisation includes multilateral elements. Pillar One envisages a Multilateral Convention implementing Amount A, which would reallocate certain profits of large multinational enterprises to market jurisdictions. The Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) under Pillar Two also involves a Multilateral Convention enabling source taxation of certain undertaxed payments. These developments represent the most ambitious attempts at multilateral approaches to substantive allocation of taxing rights since the 1920s.

The **UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation**, under development, reflects developing countries' desires for a more inclusive multilateral framework for international tax cooperation. This initiative stems from concerns that existing multilateral processes inadequately represent developing country interests and perspectives.

Despite these multilateral developments, **bilateral treaties remain dominant** in the international tax system. Countries continue negotiating new bilateral treaties and updating existing ones. The United States maintains a clear preference for bilateral approaches. The bilateral network provides the foundation upon which multilateral instruments like the MLI operate.

The likely future involves **hybrid approaches** combining bilateral and multilateral elements. Bilateral treaties may continue governing fundamental distributive rules while multilateral instruments address specific issues such as anti-avoidance, dispute resolution, and administrative cooperation. The success of purely multilateral approaches depends substantially on achieving genuine consensus among states with divergent interests—a challenge that has proven formidable throughout the history of international tax cooperation.
