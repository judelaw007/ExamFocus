## Chapter 13: Relevance of the "Other Income" Article – Article 21, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 21

Article 21 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) serves as the treaty's residual or "catch-all" provision. It addresses income that does not fall within the scope of any other distributive article—Articles 6 through 20. Every item of income received by a treaty resident must be allocated to one distributive rule, and Article 21 ensures complete coverage by capturing anything that escapes the preceding specific provisions.

The article's function is both practical and structural. Practically, it prevents gaps in the treaty's coverage that could lead to unrelieved double taxation or unintended double non-taxation. Structurally, it completes the comprehensive allocation framework, ensuring that negotiating parties need not anticipate every possible type of income—the residual rule handles unanticipated categories automatically.

#### 1.2. Policy Rationale

The policy rationale for Article 21 reflects fundamental treaty design principles. The OECD Model favours residence-state taxation for income without strong territorial connection to the source state. Where specific distributive rules allocate source-state rights—business profits connected to permanent establishments, income from immovable property, employment exercised locally—the territorial nexus justifies source taxation. For residual income lacking such connection, the residence state's comprehensive jurisdiction over its residents provides the appropriate taxing nexus.

This residence-based allocation also reflects administrative considerations. Miscellaneous income items often arise from diverse sources, making source-state taxation impractical. The residence state, with its comprehensive relationship with the taxpayer, can more effectively administer taxation of such income.

#### 1.3. Scope of Application

The scope of Article 21 extends beyond income of a class not expressly dealt with to include income from sources not expressly mentioned. This dual scope is critical—even familiar income types may fall within Article 21 if they arise from unexpected sources or circumstances not contemplated by specific articles.

The Commentary confirms that Article 21's scope is not confined to income arising in a Contracting State; it extends also to income from third States. This ensures that treaty residents receive protection from double taxation on worldwide income, not merely income arising in the other Contracting State.

#### 1.4. Historical Development

Article 21 has existed in the OECD Model since the 1963 Draft Convention, reflecting early recognition that specific income categories could not anticipate every transaction type. The article's formulation has remained relatively stable, with the core residence-state exclusive taxation principle unchanged through successive Model updates.

The UN Model's addition of paragraph 3—permitting source-state taxation—represented a significant departure from OECD orthodoxy. This addition responded to developing country concerns that exclusive residence-state taxation transferred fiscal resources from capital-importing to capital-exporting countries. The UN approach acknowledges that source states have legitimate interests in taxing miscellaneous income arising within their territories, even where no specific territorial nexus would otherwise support source taxation.

### 2. The Text of Article 21

#### 2.1. OECD Model Article 21

Article 21 of the OECD MTC 2017 contains two paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1**: "Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State."

**Paragraph 2**: "The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of the income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply."

#### 2.2. Structure and Logic

Paragraph 1 establishes the basic rule: exclusive residence-state taxation for income not covered elsewhere. The phrase "wherever arising" emphasises the comprehensive scope—income need not arise in either Contracting State to fall within Article 21.

Paragraph 2 creates an exception for income effectively connected with a permanent establishment. Where the recipient carries on business through a PE in the other state and the income-generating property or right is effectively connected to that PE, Article 7 (Business Profits) applies instead. This exception maintains consistency with the treaty's PE-based allocation framework—income connected to local business operations should be taxed by the state where those operations occur.

The exclusion for immovable property income from paragraph 2's exception preserves the situs-state's paramount right over income from real property, reflecting the strong territorial nexus that immovable property creates regardless of business connections.

### 3. Detailed Analysis of Key Elements

#### 3.1. "Items of Income"

The phrase "items of income" is deliberately broad, encompassing any economic benefit that constitutes income under either Contracting State's domestic law. This includes regular income streams, one-time receipts, deemed income, and even income acquired through unlawful means such as embezzlement—case law has confirmed that Article 21 covers income of indeterminate or unusual source.

The characterisation of a receipt as "income" depends on domestic law. Article 21 does not define income independently but relies on each state's domestic classification. This may create asymmetric outcomes where one state treats a receipt as income while the other does not.

#### 3.2. "Not Dealt With in the Foregoing Articles"

This phrase establishes Article 21's residual nature. An income item falls within Article 21 only if it is not covered by any of Articles 6-20. The determination requires systematic analysis of each preceding article to confirm that none applies.

The relationship between Article 21 and other distributive articles involves priority rules. Where an income item could potentially fall within multiple articles, the specific article takes precedence over the general residual rule. Article 21 applies only when no specific article governs the income.

Certain items commonly falling within Article 21 include:
- Lottery and gambling winnings (not covered by specific articles)
- Alimony and maintenance payments between private parties
- Scholarships and grants not qualifying under Article 20 (Students)
- Income from sources in third states not covered by specific rules
- Certain types of annuities not covered by pension provisions
- Damages and compensation payments in specific circumstances

#### 3.3. "Wherever Arising"

This phrase confirms that Article 21 applies to income from any source—the other Contracting State, third states, or even the residence state itself. The comprehensive scope ensures that treaty residents receive complete protection from double taxation, addressing situations where third-state income might otherwise face unrelieved taxation.

For example, a resident of State A receiving income from State C (a third country) may face taxation by both State A (residence) and State C (source). While the A-B treaty cannot affect State C's taxation, it can prevent State B from also taxing this income if the resident has connections there.

#### 3.4. "Taxable Only in That State"

The phrase "taxable only" grants exclusive taxing rights to the residence state. The source state (or any other state) may not tax income falling within Article 21. This exclusive allocation differs from "may be taxed" language in other articles, which permits concurrent taxation subject to relief.

Exclusive residence-state taxation eliminates the need for double taxation relief mechanisms. Where Article 21 applies, only one state may tax, preventing double taxation by design rather than requiring credit or exemption.

### 4. The Permanent Establishment Exception

#### 4.1. Scope of Paragraph 2

Paragraph 2 redirects income to Article 7 when three conditions are satisfied: the recipient carries on business in the other state through a permanent establishment; the right or property generating the income is effectively connected with that PE; and the income is not from immovable property as defined in Article 6(2).

This exception reflects the treaty's fundamental architecture. Income connected to business operations in a state should be taxed by that state as business profits, regardless of how the income might otherwise be characterised. The PE-attribution principle overrides Article 21's residence-based allocation.

#### 4.2. Effective Connection Requirement

The requirement that income be "effectively connected" with the PE requires a functional relationship between the income-generating property or right and the PE's business activities. Mere ownership by an enterprise with a PE is insufficient—the property or right must actively contribute to the PE's operations.

For example, if an enterprise operates a manufacturing PE in State B but holds investment securities unconnected to manufacturing operations, income from those securities is not effectively connected to the PE and remains within Article 21's residence-state allocation. Conversely, income from trade receivables generated by the PE's business would be effectively connected.

#### 4.3. Immovable Property Exclusion

The exclusion for immovable property income preserves Article 6's situs-state allocation regardless of PE connections. Even if immovable property is effectively connected with a PE, the income remains subject to Article 6 rather than being redirected to Article 7. This reflects the exceptional territorial nexus that immovable property creates.

### 5. UN Model Differences

#### 5.1. The Additional Paragraph 3

The UN Model Convention includes a third paragraph not present in the OECD Model:

**UN Paragraph 3**: "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State."

This provision permits source-state taxation of other income, departing significantly from the OECD's exclusive residence-state approach.

#### 5.2. Policy Rationale for UN Approach

The UN Model's source-state taxation right reflects developing country interests. Developing countries often serve as source states for income flowing to developed-country residents. Exclusive residence-state taxation under the OECD approach would deny source states any taxing rights over miscellaneous income arising within their territories.

The UN provision permits source countries to tax such income if their domestic law so provides. This preserves source-state fiscal autonomy while still requiring double taxation relief from the residence state under Article 23.

#### 5.3. Practical Implications

Under the UN approach, "other income" may face concurrent taxation—the source state exercises its paragraph 3 rights while the residence state taxes under paragraph 1. Article 23 then requires the residence state to provide relief through credit or exemption.

Treaty negotiators from developing countries often insist on the UN Model's paragraph 3, while developed countries may prefer the OECD's exclusive residence-state approach. Bilateral treaties reflect negotiated compromises between these positions.

### 6. Relationship with Other Articles

#### 6.1. Priority and Characterisation

Determining whether Article 21 applies requires analysing whether any specific article governs the income. This characterisation exercise can be complex where income has characteristics suggesting multiple possible articles.

The general principle is that specific articles take precedence over the residual rule. If income qualifies as dividends under Article 10, interest under Article 11, or royalties under Article 12, those specific provisions apply regardless of how the income might otherwise be characterised.

#### 6.2. Article 20 (Students) Interaction

Article 21 frequently interacts with Article 20 (Students). When student payments fail to qualify for Article 20 protection—because the source condition is not satisfied, or the student is no longer "visiting"—the payments may fall within Article 21 as other income.

For maintenance payments sourced within the host state, Article 20 cannot apply due to the source requirement. If the payments do not constitute employment income under Article 15, Article 21 provides the default allocation rule, granting taxing rights to the student's residence state.

#### 6.3. Article 13 (Capital Gains) Boundary

The boundary between Article 21 (Other Income) and Article 13 (Capital Gains) requires careful analysis. Income representing appreciation in asset value realised through alienation falls within Article 13. Periodic income from the asset's use falls within the relevant specific article (dividends, interest, royalties, rent) or Article 21.

Some items straddle this boundary—annuities may represent both capital and income elements, and the applicable article depends on characterisation under domestic law and treaty interpretation.

### 7. Examples of Article 21 Application

#### 7.1. Lottery and Gambling Winnings

Lottery prizes and gambling winnings typically fall within Article 21 because no specific article addresses them. The residence state has exclusive taxing rights under the OECD Model, while both residence and source states may tax under UN-based treaties.

This classification has practical significance where gambling occurs across borders—online gambling from a residence state, casino winnings in a visited state, or lottery prizes from third countries all potentially engage Article 21.

#### 7.2. Alimony and Maintenance Payments

Private maintenance payments between individuals—alimony, child support, or similar arrangements—generally fall within Article 21 when no specific article applies. Government-provided maintenance is typically exempt or covered by Article 19 (Government Service), but private payments lack specific coverage.

The residence state of the recipient has exclusive taxing rights under the OECD Model. Some bilateral treaties include specific alimony provisions modifying this default allocation.

#### 7.3. Damages and Compensation

Compensation payments require case-by-case analysis. Damages replacing employment income may fall within Article 15; damages replacing business profits within Article 7. However, damages for non-economic harm (personal injury, reputation) or punitive damages may lack a corresponding specific article and fall within Article 21.

The characterisation depends on what the damages replace—income replacement follows the character of the replaced income, while standalone compensation falls within the residual rule.

#### 7.4. Income from Third States

A treaty resident receiving income from a third country may invoke Article 21 to prevent taxation by the other Contracting State. While the treaty cannot affect the third country's taxation, it can prevent the other treaty partner from exercising any taxing rights over such income.

This protection is particularly valuable for residents with connections to multiple states—preventing claims based on former residence, citizenship, or other connecting factors that might otherwise trigger taxation.

### 8. Commentary Analysis

#### 8.1. Key Commentary Provisions

The Commentary on Article 21 emphasises its residual nature and broad scope. Commentary paragraph 1 confirms that Article 21 provides "a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of the Convention."

The Commentary also addresses specific situations:
- Dual residence cases where Article 4 deems residence in one state
- Income from sources in third states
- The relationship between paragraphs 1 and 2

#### 8.2. Interpretive Guidance

The Commentary provides interpretive guidance on characterisation disputes. Where income could arguably fall within multiple articles, the Commentary generally supports applying the most specific applicable provision, with Article 21 serving as the true residual.

This interpretive approach prevents Article 21 from being invoked to circumvent limitations in specific articles—taxpayers cannot characterise dividend income as "other income" to avoid Article 10's withholding provisions.

### 9. Practical Application

#### 9.1. Systematic Analysis Approach

Applying Article 21 requires systematic exclusion of all specific articles. The adviser should:
1. Identify the income item and its characteristics
2. Analyse whether each specific article (6-20) applies
3. Confirm that no specific article governs the income
4. Apply Article 21's residence-state allocation (or UN paragraph 3 if applicable)
5. Check for PE connection triggering paragraph 2's exception

This methodical approach ensures correct characterisation and prevents overlooking applicable specific provisions.

#### 9.2. Treaty Variations

Bilateral treaties vary significantly in their Article 21 formulations. Some treaties:
- Include the UN Model's source-state taxation provision
- Limit Article 21 to income subject to tax in the residence state
- Add specific provisions for particular income types
- Modify the PE exception's scope

Practitioners must consult the specific bilateral treaty rather than assuming OECD or UN Model language applies unchanged.

### 10. Emerging Issues

#### 10.1. Digital Economy Income

Novel income types arising from the digital economy may fall within Article 21 when they do not clearly constitute business profits, royalties, or other specifically addressed categories. Income from data monetisation, platform participation, or digital services may lack clear characterisation under traditional treaty categories.

The UN Model's new Article 12B (Automated Digital Services) addresses some such income, but treaties without this provision may see more income falling within Article 21's residual scope.

#### 10.2. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets

Income from cryptocurrency—staking rewards, airdrops, hard forks—may fall within Article 21 when it does not constitute business profits, capital gains, or other specifically addressed income. The characterisation depends on the nature of the activity generating the income and the taxpayer's circumstances.

As digital assets evolve, treaty interpretation must adapt. Article 21's flexible residual scope provides a mechanism for addressing unanticipated income types, though it may require clarifying amendments as digital economy practices mature.

#### 10.3. Subject to Tax Rules

Recent treaty developments include "subject to tax" provisions limiting treaty benefits to income actually taxed in the residence state. Such provisions, prominent in the UN Model's 2021 updates, may affect Article 21's operation by conditioning residence-state exclusive rights on actual taxation.

These developments reflect ongoing concerns about double non-taxation arising from residence-state exemptions combined with source-state treaty relief.
