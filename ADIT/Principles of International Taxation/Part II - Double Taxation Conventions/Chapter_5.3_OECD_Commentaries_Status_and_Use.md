## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE OECD COMMENTARIES

### 1.1 What Are the OECD Commentaries?

The OECD Commentaries are explanatory notes that accompany each article of the OECD Model Tax Convention. They constitute the most widely referenced source for treaty interpretation worldwide and serve multiple functions:

- **Interpretation guidance** on treaty provisions
- **Examples of application** to specific factual situations
- **Background and policy rationale** for provisions
- **Alternative provisions** for bilateral negotiation
- **Reservations** (OECD member disagreements with articles)
- **Observations** (OECD member disagreements with Commentary interpretation)
- **Positions** (non-OECD member views)

**Key facts**:
- First published: 1963 (Draft Convention)
- Current version: 2017 (with 2025 Update approved November 2025)
- Length: Approximately 550 pages in the 2017 OECD MTC
- Post-BEPS additions: Approximately 150 pages of new Commentary added in 2017 (Hattingh, 2018)
- 2025 Update: Addresses remote working PE, natural resources, Article 9, and Amount B

### 1.2 The Central Question: Legal Status

The fundamental question about the OECD Commentaries is their **legal status**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Introduction to the OECD MTC (paragraph 29) itself acknowledges that the Commentaries are "not a legally binding document." Despite this, tax officials worldwide give great weight to the guidance contained in the Commentaries, finding them useful both in deciding day-to-day questions of detail and in resolving larger issues involving policy and purpose.

---

## 2. LEGAL STATUS UNDER THE VCLT FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Classification Under VCLT Articles 31-32

The Commentaries' status under the VCLT framework is debated. The question of how the OECD Commentary fits within the terms of the Vienna Convention is significant because the VCLT refers to various extrinsic materials that can be consulted for treaty interpretation, but the Commentary does not fit neatly into any category.

| VCLT Provision | Argument For | Argument Against |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Art. 31(2)(a)** – Agreement between parties | Made "in connection with" treaty conclusion | Not specific to any bilateral DTC; made by OECD, not parties |
| **Art. 31(2)(b)** – Instrument accepted by parties | May be "accepted" through Model adoption | No formal acceptance mechanism |
| **Art. 31(3)(a)** – Subsequent agreement | Updates reflect consensus on interpretation | Not agreement between specific DTC parties |
| **Art. 31(3)(b)** – Subsequent practice | Reflects how treaties are applied | Practice of OECD, not necessarily DTC parties |
| **Art. 32** – Supplementary means | Can confirm or resolve ambiguity | Some argue should be primary, not supplementary |

**Prevailing view**: The Commentaries are best classified as **supplementary means of interpretation** under Article 32 VCLT. In *Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation* (Australia, 1990), Justice McHugh observed that whilst the OECD Model and Commentaries may not strictly amount to work preparatory to a particular DTC, they are "documents which form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements" and "provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties."

### 2.2 The OECD's Own Position

The OECD MTC Introduction (paragraphs 29-36.1) advocates for the Commentaries' interpretive relevance:

**Paragraph 29**: *"Although the Commentaries are not designed to be annexed in any manner to the conventions signed by Member countries... they can nevertheless be of great assistance in the application and interpretation of the conventions."*

**Paragraph 35**: *"Changes or additions to the Commentaries are normally applicable to the interpretation and application of conventions concluded before their adoption, because they reflect the consensus of the OECD member countries as to the proper interpretation of existing provisions."*

**Key Introduction Paragraphs Summary**:

| Paragraph | Key Guidance |
|-----------|--------------|
| Para 29 | Commentaries not legally binding but "of great assistance" |
| Para 30 | Member countries may file Observations indicating how they will apply provisions |
| Para 31 | Reservations signal intent to deviate from Model text |
| Para 33-34 | Commentary represents agreement on principles; changes reflect OECD consensus |
| Para 35 | Changes "normally applicable" to treaties concluded before adoption (ambulatory) |
| Para 36-36.1 | Ambulatory inappropriate where changes have "changed the conclusions" rather than clarifying |

This essentially advocates an **ambulatory approach**—using current Commentaries even for older treaties—but with an important qualification in paragraph 36 that limits this where Commentary has fundamentally changed rather than clarified interpretation.

### 2.3 The "Persuasive Value" Doctrine

The leading formulation of the Commentaries' status comes from *Commerzbank AG v IRC* [1990]:

> "Subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."

This principle has been consistently applied across jurisdictions, establishing that:
- Courts are not required to consult or consider the Commentaries
- The guidance is not binding on national courts, even courts of OECD member states
- Weight depends on the quality and cogency of the reasoning presented
- The Commentaries serve as persuasive but non-binding supplementary aids

---

## 3. THE STATIC VS AMBULATORY DEBATE

### 3.1 The Core Issue

A central controversy is whether courts should use:
- **Static approach**: Commentaries existing at the time of treaty conclusion
- **Ambulatory approach**: Current Commentaries (including post-treaty updates)

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Arguments for Each Approach

**Static Approach Arguments**:
1. Parties' intentions fixed at conclusion—cannot be changed unilaterally
2. Later Commentary not negotiated or consented to by parties
3. VCLT Article 31 focuses on meaning at conclusion
4. Legal certainty and predictability for taxpayers
5. Cannot impose new obligations via Commentary updates
6. Post-treaty revisions "do not reflect the intentions of the drafters" (*Alta Energy*)

**Ambulatory Approach Arguments**:
1. Commentaries clarify existing meaning, do not change it
2. Treaty terms should be interpreted dynamically
3. Reflects current international consensus
4. Practical—courts often lack access to historical versions
5. OECD member countries have implicitly accepted updates
6. "Would be unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena" (*Smallwood*)

### 3.3 The Linderfalk-Hilling View

Scholars Linderfalk and Hilling (2015) argue that no universal choice between static and ambulatory approaches can be made. Instead, the appropriate approach depends on **case-specific assessment** considering:
- Nature of the Commentary change (clarification vs new interpretation)
- Whether change was foreseeable to treaty parties
- Evidence of parties' intent regarding future Commentary use
- Whether applying updated Commentary would change treaty obligations

This conclusion contrasts with the position of many practitioners who seek a general principle to resolve all cases.

### 3.4 When Each Approach May Be Appropriate

**Ambulatory approach may be justified when**:
- Commentary merely **clarifies** existing interpretation
- Change was **foreseeable** at treaty conclusion
- Both parties are **OECD members** who participated in updates
- Treaty contains **explicit reference** to using current OECD guidance
- Commentary **expands upon concepts already found** in earlier versions

**Static approach generally appropriate when**:
- Commentary **reverses** previous interpretation
- Change addresses **issues not contemplated** at treaty conclusion
- One party is **non-OECD member** who did not participate in update
- Applying updated Commentary would **expand obligations**
- Later Commentary was "created out of thin air" (*Alta Energy*)

---

## 4. COURT PRACTICE WORLDWIDE

### 4.1 United Kingdom

The UK adopts a **qualified ambulatory approach**, treating Commentaries as persuasive but not binding:

**Commerzbank AG v IRC [1990]**:
- *"Subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."*
- Established the foundational principle for UK practice

**Fowler v HMRC [2020] (UK Supreme Court)**:
- OECD Commentaries post-dating a DTC should be given *"such persuasive force as aids to interpretation as the cogency of their reasoning deserves."*
- Weight depends on whether Commentary clarifies or changes meaning
- Confirmed UK's generally ambulatory inclination

**Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA [2006]**:
- Court of Appeal held that "beneficial owner" has an "international fiscal meaning not derived from the domestic laws of contracting states"
- Applied OECD Commentary and Conduit Company Report extensively
- Beneficial ownership requires recipient to "enjoy the full privilege to directly benefit from the income"

**Smallwood (UK)**:
- *"It would be unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena"*
- Important to consider the purpose of the treaty and relevant Commentary

### 4.2 Canada

Canada has adopted a **predominantly static approach** following *Alta Energy*:

**Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L v The Queen [2021] (SCC)**:
- Supreme Court held that Commentary updates after treaty conclusion cannot determine meaning
- *"Commentaries on art. 1 of the OECD Model Treaty that postdate the Treaty cannot be relied on to introduce terms that modify the Treaty"*
- Where Luxembourg had filed an observation contrary to OECD position, Commentary not applicable
- Treaty text prevails over subsequent Commentary
- The 2003 Commentary changes were described as "created out of thin air by the OECD"

**Prévost Car Inc v The Queen [2009]**:
- Federal Court of Appeal used Commentary on beneficial ownership
- Commentary is "a helpful complement to the earlier Commentaries, insofar as they are eliciting, rather than contradicting, views previously expressed"
- Emphasised treaty text as primary

### 4.3 Germany

Germany maintains a **strongly static approach**:

**German Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) Decision (5 December 2023, published May 2024)**:
- Ruled that a version of the OECD Commentary that did not exist before the treaty came into force cannot be relied upon
- Rejected arguments based on post-treaty Commentary
- This contradicts the official position of the German tax authorities (Finance Ministry decree favouring ambulatory interpretation)
- Creates tension between judicial and administrative approaches within Germany

### 4.4 United States

US courts generally follow an **ambulatory approach**, but with important qualifications:

- Regularly apply current Commentaries
- However, **Treasury Technical Explanations take precedence** over OECD Commentary
- Because US treaties are patterned on the US Model, not OECD Model, the IRS and Treasury view OECD Commentary as non-binding interpretive and background material

**Taisei Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (104 T.C. 558)**:
- The court "effectively adopt[ed] the interpretation supplied by later commentaries, which conflicted with the interpretation at the time the treaty went into effect"

The US Technical Explanations expressly state that they apply "notwithstanding a different interpretation in the Commentary on the OECD Model."

### 4.5 Other Jurisdictions

| Jurisdiction | General Approach | Key Cases/Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **France** | Cautious—later Commentaries have "comforting" value only | *SA Andritz* (2003): Post-treaty Commentary cannot be decisive |
| **Germany** | Static (BFH 2023) | Bundesfinanzhof contradicts Ministry's ambulatory preference |
| **Netherlands** | Case-by-case "limited dynamic interpretation" | Hoge Raad case pending for principled decision |
| **Italy** | Considers but not decisive | Commentary as "comforting element" |
| **India** | Uses Commentary extensively | Delhi High Court follows *Thiel* approach |
| **Australia** | Qualified ambulatory | *Thiel* (1990): Commentary as Article 32 supplementary means |
| **Spain** | Static (2020) | Supreme Court: Commentaries "cannot be applied retroactively" |

---

## 5. THE COMMENTARIES AND NON-OECD MEMBERS

### 5.1 The Problem

A significant issue arises when Commentaries are used to interpret DTCs involving **non-OECD member countries**:

- Non-members did not participate in Commentary drafting
- Have no "vote" on Commentary updates
- May have filed "Positions" disagreeing with OECD approach
- Using OECD Commentary against them raises legitimacy concerns

### 5.2 Positions of Non-OECD Economies

Since 1997, non-OECD countries can state their **Positions** on the OECD MTC and Commentary:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Location** | Separate section at end of OECD Model (NOT within Commentary proper) |
| **Content** | Express disagreement with Articles AND Commentary |
| **Weight** | Limited interpretive weight compared to Reservations/Observations |
| **Countries** | Include major economies: India, China, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa |

**Important**: Because Positions do not form part of the Commentary, they generally carry lower interpretive weight than Reservations and Observations made by OECD members.

### 5.3 When Commentary May Be Relevant for Non-Member Treaties

The Commentary may still be relevant when:
- DTC text follows OECD MTC wording closely
- Non-member has not filed contrary Position
- Both parties negotiated based on OECD Model
- Commentary reflects generally accepted international tax principles
- Treaty was concluded when non-member participated in OECD work

---

## 6. RESERVATIONS, OBSERVATIONS, AND POSITIONS

### 6.1 Definitions

| Type | Made By | Subject | Location | Effect |
|------|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Reservations** | OECD members | MTC Articles | Within Commentary | Signals intent to adopt different treaty text |
| **Observations** | OECD members | Commentary interpretation | Within Commentary | Signals disagreement with interpretation |
| **Positions** | Non-OECD members | Both Articles & Commentary | Separate section | Express non-member views |

The 2017 OECD Model contained **226 reservations**, with highest concentrations on Article 5 (29), Article 10 (22), and Article 13 (20). Articles 26-28 had no reservations.

### 6.2 Impact on Interpretation

**Where Reservation/Observation exists**:
- Commentary guidance **not applicable** to that country's treaties
- *"To the extent that a member country has entered reservations or observations... the guidance in the OECD Commentary is not applicable to that country's tax treaties"* (Arnold, 2021)

**Alta Energy (Canada, 2021)**: The Supreme Court noted Luxembourg's Observation disagreeing with post-treaty Commentary changes. Luxembourg had stated it "does not share the interpretation... which provide that there is generally no conflict between anti-abuse provisions of the domestic law of a Contracting State and the provisions of its tax conventions." Interpreting the Treaty with reference to the 2003 Commentaries would overlook this registered observation.

### 6.3 Exam Application

When analysing a DTC provision:
1. Check if either party has filed **Reservation** on the Article
2. Check if either party has filed **Observation** on relevant Commentary
3. Check if either party is **non-OECD member with Position**
4. If so, Commentary guidance may not apply to that treaty
5. Consider whether party participated in drafting the relevant Commentary version

---

## 7. THE UN MODEL COMMENTARY

### 7.1 UN MDTC Commentary

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention (UN MDTC) has its own Commentary:
- First published: 1980
- Current version: 2021
- Specifically addresses developing country concerns
- Often references OECD Commentary where provisions align
- More source-state focused than OECD

### 7.2 Relationship with OECD Commentary

| Feature | OECD Commentary | UN Commentary |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | OECD member focus | Developed/developing country focus |
| **Length** | More extensive (~550 pages) | Generally shorter |
| **Source taxation** | Residence-biased | More source state rights |
| **Articles 12A, 12B** | Not covered | Extensive commentary on FTS, ADS |
| **Cross-references** | Limited UN references | Frequently cites OECD |
| **Update frequency** | More regular updates | Less frequent updates |

When interpreting a DTC based on UN MDTC, the **UN Commentary** should be the primary reference, though OECD Commentary may supplement where provisions are identical.

---

## 8. POST-BEPS: THE EVOLVING ROLE OF COMMENTARIES

### 8.1 BEPS and Commentary Updates

The 2015 BEPS Project led to substantial Commentary changes in 2017:
- Approximately **150 pages** of new Commentary (Hattingh, 2018)
- New provisions required new explanatory material
- Pre-existing provisions received updated interpretation

**Key BEPS-related Commentary additions**:

| Article | BEPS Action | Commentary Changes |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Preamble | Action 6 | Anti-abuse purpose language |
| Article 1 | Action 2 | Transparent entities guidance |
| Article 5 | Action 7 | PE avoidance, commissionaire |
| Article 7 | Actions 8-10 | Profit attribution |
| Article 29 | Action 6 | PPT/LOB detailed explanation |

### 8.2 Soft Law vs Hard Law Boundary

The June 2024 exam (Q2) explored the boundary between soft law (Commentary) and hard law (treaty provisions):

*"The boundary between soft law (Commentary) and hard law (CTA provisions) may be less than clear."*

**For CTAs (MLI-modified treaties)**:
- MLI provisions are hard law (binding)
- Commentary on equivalent OECD MTC provisions may be highly relevant
- Explanatory Statement also influences interpretation

**For non-CTAs**:
- Commentary relevance depends on treaty wording
- Pre-BEPS treaties may resist post-BEPS Commentary application
- "Opt-out" from MLI may signal disagreement with BEPS measures

### 8.3 Concerns About "Backdoor" BEPS Implementation

Some scholars raise concerns that using updated Commentary to interpret older treaties effectively implements BEPS measures "through the backdoor" (Brauner, 2018):
- Countries that did not adopt MLI provisions
- Non-OECD members who did not participate in BEPS
- Pre-BEPS treaties negotiated under different assumptions
- Undermines the opt-in/opt-out flexibility of the MLI

### 8.4 The 2025 OECD Update

The November 2025 Update to the OECD MTC includes significant Commentary changes:

**Remote Working Guidance (Article 5)**:
- Addresses when employee's home or another location in a different country could create a PE
- Key principle: Simply working from home does NOT automatically create PE
- Facts and circumstances of each case are critical

**Natural Resources Provision**:
- Optional standard provision on extractive activities
- Enlarges source state taxing rights
- Lower PE threshold based on bilaterally agreed minimum time period

**Article 9 Clarifications**:
- Application in relation to domestic interest deductibility rules
- BEPS Action 4 alignment

## 12. KEY TAKEAWAYS

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          STATUS AND USE OF OECD COMMENTARIES                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  1. LEGAL STATUS: Not binding, but highly persuasive            │
│     "Persuasive value depending on cogency" (Commerzbank)       │
│     Para 29 of Introduction acknowledges non-binding nature     │
│                                                                 │
│  2. VCLT CLASSIFICATION: Best viewed as supplementary means     │
│     (Art. 32) or context-informing material (Thiel, 1990)       │
│                                                                 │
│  3. STATIC VS AMBULATORY: No universal answer                   │
│     • Static: Uses Commentary at treaty conclusion              │
│       (Canada-Alta Energy, Germany-BFH 2023, Spain 2020)        │
│     • Ambulatory: Uses current Commentary                       │
│       (UK-Fowler, US generally, OECD position)                  │
│     • Case-by-case: Linderfalk-Hilling approach                 │
│                                                                 │
│  4. RESERVATIONS/OBSERVATIONS limit applicability               │
│     • If party filed contrary position, Commentary may not apply│
│     • Check BOTH parties' positions (Alta Energy)               │
│     • Non-OECD Positions carry less weight                      │
│                                                                 │
│  5. NON-OECD MEMBERS: More limited Commentary relevance         │
│     • Did not participate in drafting                           │
│     • Positions express their views but outside Commentary      │
│                                                                 │
│  6. POST-BEPS: 150+ pages of new Commentary in 2017             │
│     • Soft law/hard law boundary blurred                        │
│     • 2025 Update: remote working, natural resources, Art. 9    │
│     • Concern about "backdoor" BEPS implementation              │
│                                                                 │
│  7. UN COMMENTARY: Separate source for UN Model treaties        │
│     • More source-state focused                                 │
│     • Covers Articles 12A (FTS), 12B (ADS)                      │
│                                                                 │
│  8. PRACTICAL USE: Quote specific paragraphs when possible      │
│     • Commentary on Article X, [paragraph number]               │
│     • Check for jurisdictional approach before applying         │
│                                                                 │
