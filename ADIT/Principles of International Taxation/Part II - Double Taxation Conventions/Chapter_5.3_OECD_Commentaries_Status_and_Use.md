# Chapter 5.3: The OECD Commentaries – Status and Use

## 1. Introduction to the OECD Commentaries

The OECD Commentaries are explanatory notes that accompany each article of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD MTC). They constitute the most widely referenced source for treaty interpretation worldwide and serve multiple functions: providing interpretation guidance on treaty provisions, offering examples of application to specific factual situations, explaining the background and policy rationale for provisions, presenting alternative provisions for bilateral negotiation, and recording reservations, observations, and positions of member and non-member countries.

First published in 1963 alongside the Draft Convention, the Commentaries have evolved substantially. The current version dates from 2017, with the most recent update approved by the OECD Council in November 2025. The 2017 edition spans approximately 550 pages, with the post-BEPS additions in 2017 alone accounting for approximately 150 pages of new Commentary material. The 2025 Update addresses several contemporary issues including remote working and permanent establishment, natural resources, and Article 9 clarifications.

### 1.1. The Central Question of Legal Status

The fundamental question about the OECD Commentaries concerns their legal status. They are not legally binding instruments and do not form part of the treaty text itself. Yet in practice they are highly persuasive and regularly consulted by courts worldwide. Their ambulatory nature—being periodically updated—creates particular interpretive challenges.

The Introduction to the OECD MTC itself, at paragraph 29, acknowledges that the Commentaries are "not a legally binding document." Despite this, paragraph 29 continues by noting that the Commentaries "can nevertheless be of great assistance in the application and interpretation of the conventions" and that tax officials worldwide give great weight to the guidance they contain.

## 2. Legal Status under the VCLT Framework

### 2.1. Classification under VCLT Articles 31-32

The question of how the OECD Commentary fits within the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) framework is significant because the VCLT refers to various extrinsic materials that may be consulted for treaty interpretation, but the Commentary does not fit neatly into any single category.

Under Article 31(2)(a), which refers to agreements made "in connection with" treaty conclusion, one might argue that the Commentary qualifies since it was made in connection with the Model's development. However, the Commentary is not specific to any bilateral DTC and is made by the OECD, not by the contracting parties themselves. Similarly, Article 31(2)(b), concerning instruments "accepted" by the parties, presents difficulties because there is no formal acceptance mechanism for the Commentaries.

Article 31(3)(a), dealing with subsequent agreements on interpretation, and Article 31(3)(b), concerning subsequent practice, face comparable objections: the Commentary updates represent OECD consensus rather than agreement between specific DTC parties. Consequently, the prevailing view classifies the Commentaries as supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.

In *Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation* (Australia, 1990), Justice McHugh observed that whilst the OECD Model and Commentaries may not strictly amount to work preparatory to a particular DTC, they are "documents which form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements" and "provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties." This influential decision positioned the Commentaries as falling within the supplementary means of interpretation contemplated by Article 32.

### 2.2. The OECD's Position

The OECD MTC Introduction, at paragraphs 29 through 36.1, advocates for the Commentaries' interpretive relevance. Paragraph 29 states that "although the Commentaries are not designed to be annexed in any manner to the conventions signed by Member countries... they can nevertheless be of great assistance in the application and interpretation of the conventions."

Paragraph 35 contains the OECD's clearest statement on the temporal dimension of Commentary use: "Changes or additions to the Commentaries are normally applicable to the interpretation and application of conventions concluded before their adoption, because they reflect the consensus of the OECD member countries as to the proper interpretation of existing provisions." This essentially advocates an ambulatory approach—using current Commentaries even for older treaties.

However, paragraph 36 qualifies this position, stating that the ambulatory approach is inappropriate where Commentary changes have "changed the conclusions" rather than merely clarifying existing interpretation. Paragraph 36.1 further elaborates that where substantive changes are involved, the prior Commentary version should apply to treaties concluded before the change.

### 2.3. The Persuasive Value Doctrine

The leading formulation of the Commentaries' status in common law jurisdictions comes from *Commerzbank AG v IRC* [1990], where the court stated that "subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."

This principle establishes several important points: courts are not required to consult or consider the Commentaries; the guidance is not binding on national courts, even courts of OECD member states; the weight accorded depends on the quality and cogency of the reasoning presented; and the Commentaries serve as persuasive but non-binding supplementary aids. The *Commerzbank* formulation has been consistently applied across common law jurisdictions and forms the foundation for understanding the Commentaries' practical authority.

## 3. The Static versus Ambulatory Debate

### 3.1. The Core Issue

A central controversy in treaty interpretation concerns whether courts should apply Commentary that existed at the time of treaty conclusion (the static approach) or the current Commentary including post-treaty updates (the ambulatory approach). This debate reflects broader tensions between respecting the original intent of the contracting parties and maintaining contemporary relevance in treaty interpretation. *(a recurring examination topic)*

The static approach uses Commentaries existing at treaty conclusion, respecting the parties' original intent, providing greater legal certainty, and remaining consistent with traditional VCLT interpretation principles. Key jurisdictions favouring this approach include Canada following the *Alta Energy* decision and Germany following recent Bundesfinanzhof jurisprudence.

The ambulatory approach uses current or latest Commentaries, keeping interpretation current, reflecting evolving international consensus, and aligning with the OECD's own position as expressed in the Introduction at paragraph 35. Key jurisdictions with ambulatory inclinations include the United Kingdom following *Fowler v HMRC* and generally the United States.

### 3.2. Arguments for Each Approach

The static approach finds support in several considerations. The parties' intentions are fixed at treaty conclusion and cannot be changed unilaterally by subsequent OECD action. Later Commentary was not negotiated or consented to by the parties to any specific bilateral treaty. VCLT Article 31 focuses on meaning at the time of conclusion. Legal certainty and predictability for taxpayers require stable interpretation. New obligations cannot be imposed via Commentary updates without the parties' consent.

The ambulatory approach also has principled support. The Commentaries clarify existing meaning rather than change it, supporters argue. Treaty terms should be interpreted dynamically to address contemporary circumstances. Current Commentary reflects international consensus on proper interpretation. Practical considerations favour the ambulatory approach since courts often lack access to historical Commentary versions. OECD member countries have implicitly accepted updates through their participation in the Committee on Fiscal Affairs process.

### 3.3. When Each Approach May Apply

Scholars Linderfalk and Hilling have argued persuasively that no universal choice between static and ambulatory approaches can be made. Instead, the appropriate approach depends on case-specific assessment considering: the nature of the Commentary change (clarification versus new interpretation); whether the change was foreseeable to treaty parties; evidence of parties' intent regarding future Commentary use; and whether applying updated Commentary would substantively change treaty obligations.

An ambulatory approach may be justified when the Commentary merely clarifies existing interpretation, when the change was foreseeable at treaty conclusion, when both parties are OECD members who participated in the updates, when the treaty contains explicit reference to using current OECD guidance, or when the Commentary expands upon concepts already found in earlier versions.

A static approach is generally appropriate when Commentary reverses previous interpretation, when the change addresses issues not contemplated at treaty conclusion, when one party is a non-OECD member who did not participate in the update, or when applying updated Commentary would expand the parties' obligations. In *Alta Energy* [2021], the Supreme Court of Canada described certain 2003 Commentary changes as being "created out of thin air by the OECD," emphasising that such changes cannot bind parties who did not consent to them.

## 4. Court Practice Worldwide

### 4.1. United Kingdom

The United Kingdom adopts a qualified ambulatory approach, treating Commentaries as persuasive but not binding. The foundational principle was established in *Commerzbank AG v IRC* [1990], which held that "subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."

In *Fowler v HMRC* [2020], the UK Supreme Court confirmed this approach, holding that OECD Commentaries post-dating a DTC should be given "such persuasive force as aids to interpretation as the cogency of their reasoning deserves." The weight given depends on whether the Commentary clarifies or substantively changes the meaning. The Court in *Smallwood* had earlier observed that "it would be unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena."

*Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA* [2006] provides an important example of Commentary application. The Court of Appeal held that "beneficial owner" has an "international fiscal meaning not derived from the domestic laws of contracting states," applying OECD Commentary and the Conduit Company Report extensively to conclude that beneficial ownership requires the recipient to "enjoy the full privilege to directly benefit from the income."

### 4.2. Canada

Canada has adopted a predominantly static approach following the Supreme Court's decision in *Canada v Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L.* [2021]. The Court held that Commentary updates after treaty conclusion cannot determine treaty meaning, stating that "Commentaries on art. 1 of the OECD Model Treaty that postdate the Treaty cannot be relied on to introduce terms that modify the Treaty."

The Court noted that Luxembourg had filed an observation contrary to the OECD position, which made the Commentary guidance inapplicable to Luxembourg's treaties. Interpreting the Treaty with reference to the 2003 Commentaries would overlook this registered observation. Treaty text prevails over subsequent Commentary, and not only would applying later Commentary effectively amend the Treaty in a manner not agreed upon by the parties, but it would also usurp the role of the executive by allowing judicial amendment of bilateral treaties against the expressed wishes of the contracting states.

In the earlier *Prévost Car Inc v The Queen* [2009], the Federal Court of Appeal had used Commentary on beneficial ownership, noting that Commentary is "a helpful complement to the earlier Commentaries, insofar as they are eliciting, rather than contradicting, views previously expressed," while emphasising that treaty text remains primary.

### 4.3. Germany

Germany exhibits a significant tension between judicial and administrative approaches. In a decision dated 5 December 2023 (published May 2024), the German Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) ruled that a version of the OECD Commentary that did not exist before the treaty came into force cannot be relied upon. This represents a strongly static judicial approach.

This position contradicts the official stance of the German tax authorities. In a decree dated 19 April 2023, the German Ministry of Finance provided guidance stating that updates to the OECD model commentary must be considered when interpreting DTTs, even if a DTT was concluded prior to such updates, emphasising a dynamic application of the OECD model commentary. How this tension between the Bundesfinanzhof and the Ministry will be resolved remains to be seen.

### 4.4. United States

US courts generally follow an ambulatory approach but with important qualifications. Courts regularly apply current Commentaries to interpret tax treaties. However, Treasury Technical Explanations take precedence over OECD Commentary when the two diverge. Because US treaties are patterned on the US Model rather than the OECD Model, the IRS and Treasury view OECD Commentary as non-binding interpretive and background material.

The Technical Explanations to US treaties expressly state that they apply "notwithstanding a different interpretation in the Commentary on the OECD Model." In *Taisei Fire & Marine Insurance Co.*, the Tax Court effectively adopted the interpretation supplied by later commentaries even where this conflicted with the interpretation at the time the treaty went into effect.

### 4.5. Other Jurisdictions

Other jurisdictions display varying approaches. France has been cautious, with later Commentaries having only "comforting" value; in *SA Andritz* (2003), the Conseil d'État held that post-treaty Commentary cannot be decisive. The Netherlands applies a case-by-case "limited dynamic interpretation," with the Hoge Raad yet to deliver a definitive principled decision. Italy considers the Commentary but treats it as a "comforting element" rather than determinative. India uses Commentary extensively, with the Delhi High Court following the *Thiel* approach. Australia follows a qualified ambulatory approach based on *Thiel* (1990), treating Commentary as Article 32 supplementary means. Spain's Supreme Court in 2020 held that Commentaries "cannot be applied retroactively," adopting a static position.

## 5. The Commentaries and Non-OECD Members

A significant issue arises when Commentaries are used to interpret DTCs involving non-OECD member countries. Non-members did not participate in Commentary drafting, have no vote on Commentary updates, and may have filed "Positions" disagreeing with the OECD approach. Using OECD Commentary against them raises legitimacy concerns.

Since 1997, non-OECD countries have been able to state their Positions on the OECD MTC and Commentary. These Positions appear in a separate section at the end of the OECD Model, not within the Commentary proper. They may express disagreement with both Articles and Commentary interpretation. However, because Positions do not form part of the Commentary itself, they generally carry lower interpretive weight than Reservations and Observations made by OECD members. Countries that have filed Positions include major economies such as India, China, Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa.

The Commentary may still be relevant for treaties with non-members when the DTC text follows OECD MTC wording closely, the non-member has not filed a contrary Position, both parties negotiated based on the OECD Model, the Commentary reflects generally accepted international tax principles, or the treaty was concluded when the non-member was participating in OECD work.

## 6. Reservations, Observations, and Positions

### 6.1. Definitions and Distinctions

Three mechanisms allow countries to express disagreement with the OECD MTC and its Commentary. Reservations are made by OECD members in respect of MTC Articles, signalling intent to adopt different treaty text. They appear within the Commentary on the relevant article. The 2017 OECD Model contained 226 reservations, with highest concentrations on Article 5 (29), Article 10 (22), and Article 13 (20); Articles 26-28 had no reservations.

Observations are made by OECD members in respect of Commentary interpretation, signalling disagreement with how the Commentary interprets particular provisions. They also appear within the Commentary proper. *(covered in December 2023)*

Positions are made by non-OECD members and may address both Articles and Commentary. They appear in a separate section rather than within the Commentary, which affects their interpretive weight.

### 6.2. Impact on Interpretation

Where a country has filed a Reservation or Observation, the Commentary guidance is not applicable to that country's treaties on the relevant point. As Arnold (2021) notes, "to the extent that a member country has entered reservations or observations... the guidance in the OECD Commentary is not applicable to that country's tax treaties."

The *Alta Energy* decision illustrates this principle. The Supreme Court of Canada noted Luxembourg's Observation disagreeing with post-treaty Commentary changes. Luxembourg had stated it "does not share the interpretation... which provide that there is generally no conflict between anti-abuse provisions of the domestic law of a Contracting State and the provisions of its tax conventions." Interpreting the Treaty with reference to the 2003 Commentaries would overlook this registered observation.

When analysing a DTC provision, practitioners should check whether either party has filed a Reservation on the Article, whether either party has filed an Observation on the relevant Commentary, and whether either party is a non-OECD member with a Position. If so, Commentary guidance may not apply to that treaty. Consideration should also be given to whether the party participated in drafting the relevant Commentary version.

## 7. The UN Model Commentary

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention (UN MDTC) has its own Commentary, first published in 1980 with the current version dating from 2021. It specifically addresses developing country concerns and is more source-state focused than the OECD Commentary.

The UN Commentary often references the OECD Commentary where provisions align between the two Models, with changes and additions appearing in italics within square brackets to indicate UN-specific guidance. However, important differences exist. The UN Model retains Article 14 on Independent Personal Services, which the OECD deleted in 2000. The UN Commentary covers Articles 12A (Fees for Technical Services) and 12B (Income from Automated Digital Services) extensively, as these provisions have no OECD equivalent. The UN Model applies a six-month threshold for construction PEs under Article 5(3)(a), compared to twelve months under the OECD Model.

When interpreting a DTC based on the UN MDTC, the UN Commentary should be the primary reference, though OECD Commentary may supplement where provisions are identical.

## 8. The Post-BEPS Evolution of Commentaries

### 8.1. BEPS Commentary Additions

The 2015 BEPS Project led to substantial Commentary changes in the 2017 update, adding approximately 150 pages of new material. New provisions required new explanatory material, while pre-existing provisions received updated interpretation. *(covered in June 2024)*

Key BEPS-related Commentary additions included the Preamble anti-abuse purpose language (Action 6), Article 1 transparent entities guidance (Action 2), Article 5 PE avoidance and commissionaire arrangements (Action 7), Article 7 profit attribution guidance (Actions 8-10), and Article 29 detailed explanation of the PPT and LOB provisions (Action 6).

The boundary between soft law (Commentary) and hard law (treaty provisions) has become less clear in the post-BEPS environment. For Covered Tax Agreements modified by the MLI, the MLI provisions are hard law, but Commentary on equivalent OECD MTC provisions remains highly relevant for interpretation. The MLI Explanatory Statement also influences interpretation of MLI-modified treaties.

Some scholars have raised concerns that using updated Commentary to interpret older treaties effectively implements BEPS measures "through the backdoor" for countries that did not adopt MLI provisions, for non-OECD members who did not participate in BEPS, for pre-BEPS treaties negotiated under different assumptions, and in ways that undermine the opt-in and opt-out flexibility of the MLI.

### 8.2. The 2025 Update

The November 2025 Update to the OECD MTC includes significant Commentary changes addressing contemporary issues. On remote working under Article 5, the revised Commentary provides clarification on when an employee's home or another location in a different country could create a "fixed place of business" permanent establishment. The key principle established is that simply working from home does not automatically create a PE; the facts and circumstances of each case are critical.

The Update also includes an optional standard provision on activities in connection with the exploration and exploitation of extractable natural resources, enlarging source state taxing rights by means of a lower PE threshold based on a bilaterally agreed minimum time period. Commentary on Article 9 has been significantly reworked to reaffirm the central role of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and clarify the interaction between Article 9 and domestic rules on thin capitalisation and interest limitation, including the BEPS Action 4 recommendations.
