## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE OECD COMMENTARIES

### 1.1 What Are the OECD Commentaries?

The OECD Commentaries are explanatory notes that accompany each article of the OECD Model Tax Convention. They provide:
- Interpretation guidance on treaty provisions
- Examples of application to specific situations
- Background and policy rationale for provisions
- Alternative provisions for bilateral negotiation
- Reservations (OECD member disagreements with articles)
- Observations (OECD member disagreements with Commentary interpretation)
- Positions (non-OECD member views)

**Key facts**:
- First published: 1963 (Draft Convention)
- Current version: 2017 (with ongoing updates)
- Length: Approximately 550 pages in the 2017 OECD MTC
- Post-BEPS additions: Approximately 150 pages of new Commentary added in 2017 (Hattingh, 2018)

### 1.2 The Central Question: Legal Status

The fundamental question about the OECD Commentaries is their **legal status**:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Introduction to the OECD MTC (paragraph 29) itself acknowledges that the Commentaries are "not a legally binding document."

---

## 2. LEGAL STATUS UNDER THE VCLT FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Classification Under VCLT Articles 31-32

The Commentaries' status under the VCLT framework is debated. Possible classifications:

| VCLT Provision | Argument For | Argument Against |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Art. 31(2)(a)** – Agreement between parties | Made "in connection with" treaty conclusion | Not specific to any bilateral DTC; made by OECD, not parties |
| **Art. 31(2)(b)** – Instrument accepted by parties | May be "accepted" through Model adoption | No formal acceptance mechanism |
| **Art. 31(3)(a)** – Subsequent agreement | Updates reflect consensus on interpretation | Not agreement between specific DTC parties |
| **Art. 31(3)(b)** – Subsequent practice | Reflects how treaties are applied | Practice of OECD, not necessarily DTC parties |
| **Art. 32** – Supplementary means | Can confirm or resolve ambiguity | Should be primary, not supplementary |

**Prevailing view**: The Commentaries are best classified as **supplementary means of interpretation** under Article 32 VCLT, or as persuasive material that informs the "context" under Article 31.

### 2.2 The OECD's Own Position

The OECD MTC Introduction (paragraphs 33-36.1) advocates for the Commentaries' interpretive relevance:

**Paragraph 29**: *"Although the Commentaries are not designed to be annexed in any manner to the conventions signed by Member countries... they can nevertheless be of great assistance in the application and interpretation of the conventions."*

**Paragraph 35**: *"Changes or additions to the Commentaries are normally applicable to the interpretation and application of conventions concluded before their adoption, because they reflect the consensus of the OECD member countries as to the proper interpretation of existing provisions."*

This essentially advocates an **ambulatory approach**—using current Commentaries even for older treaties.

---

## 3. THE STATIC VS AMBULATORY DEBATE

### 3.1 The Core Issue

A central controversy is whether courts should use:
- **Static approach**: Commentaries existing at the time of treaty conclusion
- **Ambulatory approach**: Current Commentaries (including post-treaty updates)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              STATIC VS AMBULATORY APPROACHES                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  STATIC APPROACH                                                │

│  • Respects parties' original intent                            │

│  • Consistent with traditional VCLT interpretation              │
│                                                                 │

│  • Reflects evolving consensus                                  │

│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Arguments for Each Approach

**Static Approach Arguments**:
1. Parties' intentions fixed at conclusion—cannot be changed unilaterally
2. Later Commentary not negotiated or consented to by parties
3. VCLT Article 31 focuses on meaning at conclusion
4. Legal certainty and predictability
5. Cannot impose new obligations via Commentary updates

**Ambulatory Approach Arguments**:
1. Commentaries clarify existing meaning, don't change it
2. Treaty terms should be interpreted dynamically
3. Reflects current international consensus
4. Practical—courts often lack access to historical versions
5. OECD member countries have implicitly accepted updates

### 3.3 The Linderfalk-Hilling View

Scholars Linderfalk and Hilling argue that no universal choice between static and ambulatory approaches can be made. Instead, the appropriate approach depends on **case-specific assessment** considering:
- Nature of the Commentary change (clarification vs new interpretation)
- Whether change was foreseeable to treaty parties
- Evidence of parties' intent regarding future Commentary use
- Whether applying updated Commentary would change treaty obligations

### 3.4 When Ambulatory Approach May Be Appropriate

The ambulatory approach may be justified when:
- Commentary merely **clarifies** existing interpretation
- Change was **foreseeable** at treaty conclusion
- Both parties are **OECD members** who participated in updates
- Treaty contains **explicit reference** to using current OECD guidance

The ambulatory approach is generally **inappropriate** when:
- Commentary **reverses** previous interpretation
- Change addresses **issues not contemplated** at treaty conclusion
- One party is **non-OECD member** who did not participate in update
- Applying updated Commentary would **expand obligations**

---

## 4. COURT PRACTICE WORLDWIDE

### 4.1 United Kingdom

The UK adopts a **qualified ambulatory approach**, treating Commentaries as persuasive but not binding:

**Commerzbank AG v IRC [1990]**:
- *"Subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."*

**Fowler v HMRC [2020] (UK Supreme Court)**:
- OECD Commentaries post-dating a DTC should be given *"such persuasive force as aids to interpretation as the cogency of their reasoning deserves."*
- Weight depends on whether Commentary clarifies or changes meaning

**Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA [2006]**:
- Court of Appeal used OECD Commentary on "beneficial owner"
- Adopted autonomous international meaning informed by Commentary

### 4.2 Canada

Canada generally follows a **more static approach**:

**Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L v The Queen [2021] (SCC)**:
- Supreme Court held that Commentary updates after treaty conclusion cannot determine meaning
- Where Luxembourg had filed an observation contrary to OECD position, Commentary not applicable
- Treaty text prevails over subsequent Commentary

**Prévost Car Inc v The Queen [2009]**:
- Federal Court of Appeal used Commentary on beneficial ownership
- But emphasised treaty text as primary

### 4.3 United States

US courts generally follow an **ambulatory approach**:
- Regularly apply current Commentaries
- Treasury Technical Explanations also considered
- Courts give significant weight to Commentary reasoning

### 4.4 Other Jurisdictions

| Jurisdiction | General Approach | Key Cases/Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **France** | Cautious—later Commentaries have "comforting" value only | *SA Andritz* (2003): Post-treaty Commentary cannot be decisive |
| **Germany** | Accepts Commentary as persuasive | Bundesfinanzhof references Commentary regularly |
| **Netherlands** | Generally ambulatory | Hoge Raad gives significant weight to Commentary |
| **Italy** | Considers but not decisive | Commentary as "comforting element" |
| **India** | Uses Commentary extensively | Often cited in beneficial ownership cases |
| **Australia** | Qualified ambulatory | *Lamesa* (1997) considered Commentary |

---

## 5. THE COMMENTARIES AND NON-OECD MEMBERS

### 5.1 The Problem

A significant issue arises when Commentaries are used to interpret DTCs involving **non-OECD member countries**:

- Non-members did not participate in Commentary drafting
- Have no "vote" on Commentary updates
- May have filed "Positions" disagreeing with OECD approach

### 5.2 Positions of Non-OECD Economies

Since 1997, non-OECD countries can state their **Positions** on the OECD MTC and Commentary. Key points:
- Located in separate section (not within Commentary proper)
- Do not form part of the Commentary
- Express disagreement with Articles AND Commentary
- Limited interpretive weight compared to Reservations/Observations

### 5.3 When Commentary May Be Relevant for Non-Member Treaties

The Commentary may still be relevant when:
- DTC text follows OECD MTC wording
- Non-member has not filed contrary Position
- Both parties negotiated based on OECD Model
- Commentary reflects generally accepted international tax principles

---

## 6. RESERVATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS

### 6.1 Definitions (Building on Chapter 5.1)

| Type | Made By | Subject | Location | Effect on Commentary |
|------|---------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Reservations** | OECD members | MTC Articles | Within Commentary | Signals intent to adopt different treaty text |
| **Observations** | OECD members | Commentary interpretation | Within Commentary | Signals disagreement with interpretation |
| **Positions** | Non-OECD members | Both Articles & Commentary | Separate section | Express non-member views |

### 6.2 Impact on Interpretation

**Where Reservation/Observation exists**:
- Commentary guidance **not applicable** to that country's treaties
- *"To the extent that a member country has entered reservations or observations... the guidance in the OECD Commentary is not applicable to that country's tax treaties"* (Arnold, 2021)

**Alta Energy (Canada, 2021)**: The Supreme Court noted Luxembourg's Observation on Article 1 meant post-treaty Commentary could not override parties' original intentions.

### 6.3 Exam Application

When analysing a DTC provision:
1. Check if either party has filed **Reservation** on the Article
2. Check if either party has filed **Observation** on relevant Commentary
3. If so, Commentary guidance may not apply to that treaty
4. Consider whether party is OECD member or non-member with Position

---

## 7. THE UN MODEL COMMENTARY

### 7.1 UN MDTC Commentary

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention (UN MDTC) also has its own Commentary:
- First published: 1980
- Current version: 2021
- Specifically addresses developing country concerns
- Often references OECD Commentary where provisions align

### 7.2 Relationship with OECD Commentary

| Feature | OECD Commentary | UN Commentary |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | OECD member focus | Developed/developing country focus |
| **Length** | More extensive | Generally shorter |
| **Source taxation** | Residence-biased | More source state rights |
| **Articles 12A, 12B** | Not covered | Extensive commentary |
| **Cross-references** | Limited UN references | Frequently cites OECD |

When interpreting a DTC based on UN MDTC, the **UN Commentary** should be the primary reference, though OECD Commentary may supplement where provisions are identical.

---

## 8. POST-BEPS: THE EVOLVING ROLE OF COMMENTARIES

### 8.1 BEPS and Commentary Updates

The 2015 BEPS Project led to substantial Commentary changes in 2017:
- Approximately **150 pages** of new Commentary (Hattingh, 2018)
- New provisions required new explanatory material
- Pre-existing provisions received updated interpretation

**Key BEPS-related Commentary additions**:
| Article | BEPS Action | Commentary Changes |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Preamble | Action 6 | Anti-abuse purpose |
| Article 1 | Action 2 | Transparent entities |
| Article 5 | Action 7 | PE avoidance |
| Article 7 | Actions 8-10 | Profit attribution |
| Article 29 | Action 6 | PPT/LOB explanation |

### 8.2 Soft Law vs Hard Law Boundary

The June 2024 exam (Q2) explored the boundary between soft law (Commentary) and hard law (treaty provisions):

*"The boundary between soft law (Commentary) and hard law (CTA provisions) may be less than clear."*

**For CTAs (MLI-modified treaties)**:
- MLI provisions are hard law (binding)
- Commentary on equivalent OECD MTC provisions may be highly relevant
- Explanatory Statement also influences interpretation

**For non-CTAs**:
- Commentary relevance depends on treaty wording
- Pre-BEPS treaties may resist post-BEPS Commentary application
- "Opt-out" from MLI may signal disagreement with BEPS measures

### 8.3 Concerns About "Backdoor" BEPS Implementation

Some scholars raise concerns that using updated Commentary to interpret older treaties effectively implements BEPS measures "through the backdoor" (Brauner, 2018):
- Countries that did not adopt MLI provisions
- Non-OECD members who did not participate in BEPS
- Pre-BEPS treaties negotiated under different assumptions
