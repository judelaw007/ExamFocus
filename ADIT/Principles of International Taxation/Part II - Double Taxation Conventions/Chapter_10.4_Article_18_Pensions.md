## Chapter 10.4: Pensions – Article 18, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 18

Article 18 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) allocates taxing rights over pensions and other similar remuneration paid in consideration of past employment. Unlike the source-based taxation that generally applies to active employment income under Article 15, Article 18 establishes exclusive residence state taxation as the default rule under the OECD Model.

The provision addresses a category of income that arises after the employment relationship has ended but derives from that relationship. Pensions represent deferred compensation for past services, and the policy question is whether they should be taxed where the employment was performed (source principle) or where the recipient resides when receiving payment (residence principle).

#### 1.2. Policy Rationale for Residence Taxation

The OECD Model favours residence state taxation for several reasons. Administrative simplicity is paramount: pensioners typically reside in a single country and can more easily comply with one tax system rather than multiple source countries where they may have worked during their careers. The residence state is better positioned to assess the pensioner's overall ability to pay tax, taking into account worldwide income and personal circumstances.

Additionally, pensions are often funded from multiple sources accumulated over careers spanning several countries, making source allocation administratively complex. The residence state can apply progressive rates appropriately and provide personal allowances suited to the taxpayer's circumstances.

However, this residence-based approach has been criticised by developing countries. When workers from developed countries work in developing countries for extended periods, build pension entitlements there, and then retire to their home countries, the developing country where employment was exercised loses all taxing rights over the resulting pension income. This concern underlies the UN Model's departure from exclusive residence taxation. *(covered in June 2025)*

### 2. The Text of Article 18

#### 2.1. OECD Model Article 18

Article 18 of the OECD MTC 2017 provides: "Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 19, pensions and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State."

The opening phrase "subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 19" establishes that government service pensions take priority under Article 19(2). Private employment pensions fall within Article 18, while pensions for government service are governed by Article 19(2)'s separate rules.

#### 2.2. Key Elements

The provision contains several significant elements. The income covered comprises "pensions and other similar remuneration," extending beyond periodic payments to include lump sums and other forms of retirement benefit. The recipient must be "a resident of a Contracting State" at the time of payment—residence is determined under Article 4, and changes in residence may alter taxing rights. The critical nexus is "in consideration of past employment," requiring that the payment relate to a previous employment relationship rather than independent services or unrelated annuities. The taxing right is expressed as "taxable only," indicating exclusive residence state taxation with no source state right.

### 3. Scope and Definitions

#### 3.1. Meaning of "Pensions"

The term "pensions" is not defined in Article 3 of the OECD MTC, leaving interpretation to domestic law under Article 3(2) subject to context. The Commentary provides guidance: pensions generally include periodic payments made after retirement, lump-sum payments in lieu of periodic payments, payments from employer-established pension schemes, and payments from private pension arrangements linked to employment.

The phrase "other similar remuneration" extends Article 18 to cover lump-sum commutations of pension rights, early retirement payments, severance payments related to past employment, and deferred compensation arrangements. Commentary paragraph 5 confirms that restructuring pension benefits as lump sums rather than periodic payments does not change the tax treatment.

#### 3.2. "In Consideration of Past Employment"

This phrase establishes the essential nexus between the payment and a previous employment relationship. Two implications follow. First, an employment nexus is required—payments for independent personal services fall outside Article 18. Second, the location of past employment is irrelevant for Article 18 purposes; only the recipient's residence at the time of payment matters.

An individual who worked in Country X for thirty years and then retires to Country Y receives pension payments taxable only in Country Y under OECD Article 18. Country X, where employment was exercised, must exempt the pension payments.

#### 3.3. Social Security Payments

Social security payments are not expressly covered by OECD Article 18. The Commentary at paragraphs 24-28 acknowledges that countries may include social security within Article 18, add a separate provision for social security, or allow source state taxation. In the absence of a specific provision, social security payments may fall under Article 21 (Other Income), resulting in residence state taxation.

Many bilateral treaties include explicit social security provisions to address this gap. The treatment varies significantly across treaty networks.

### 4. UN Model Differences

#### 4.1. Alternative Approaches

The UN Model Tax Convention takes a fundamentally different approach to pension taxation, reflecting developing country preferences for source-based taxation. The UN MDTC provides alternative provisions that negotiating states may adopt.

Alternative A follows the OECD approach: pensions are taxable only in the residence state. This option suits countries with roughly balanced pension flows or those prioritising administrative simplicity.

Alternative B permits source state taxation. Under this approach, pensions may be taxed in both the source state (where the pension arises) and the residence state, with the residence state providing credit for source state tax. For social security specifically, Alternative B may grant the source state exclusive taxing rights.

#### 4.2. Significance for Developing Countries

The UN Model's source taxation alternative addresses developing country revenue concerns. When workers from developed countries work in developing countries, build pension entitlements, and then retire abroad, the OECD Model grants exclusive taxation to the developed country of retirement. The UN Model's Alternative B allows the developing country where employment occurred to share in taxing the resulting pension income.

This reflects the broader tension in international tax policy between capital-exporting countries (favouring residence taxation) and capital-importing countries (favouring source taxation).

### 5. Relationship with Article 19

#### 5.1. Priority of Government Pensions

Article 18 expressly states it is "subject to" Article 19(2), meaning government service pensions take priority. Under Article 19(2), pensions paid by a Contracting State or political subdivision for services rendered to that State are taxable only in the paying state.

An exception exists where the recipient is both resident and a national of the other Contracting State. In that case, the pension falls back to Article 18 and is taxable only in the residence state.

#### 5.2. Practical Distinction

The distinction matters because it determines which state has exclusive taxing rights. Private employment pensions are taxable in the residence state under Article 18. Government service pensions are taxable in the paying state under Article 19(2). Government pensions paid to nationals of the residence state revert to residence taxation under Article 18.

An individual who worked for both government and private employers receives split treatment: government pension taxable in the paying state, private pension taxable in the residence state.

### 6. Pension Fund Issues

#### 6.1. Treaty Access for Pension Funds

Pension funds face unique challenges in accessing treaty benefits. Article 4(1) requires that a person be "liable to tax" to qualify as a resident for treaty purposes, yet pension funds are typically tax-exempt in their residence state.

Some countries interpret "liable to tax" broadly, treating exempt entities as nonetheless resident because they fall within the scope of the tax system. Other countries, including Chile and France, take the position that pension funds are not residents for treaty purposes due to their exempt status.

The Commentary at paragraph 8.9 to Article 4 acknowledges this divergence and recommends that countries negotiate explicit provisions clarifying pension fund treaty access.

#### 6.2. Pension Fund Investment Income

When pension funds invest cross-border, source country withholding taxes on dividends and interest create a particular problem. The pension fund cannot credit the withholding tax against its exempt income, resulting in unrelieved economic burden.

Commentary paragraph 69 to Article 18 (and Commentary 13.1 to Article 10) recommends that pension funds should be exempt from source state taxation on investment income to mirror their treatment in the residence state. Some treaties, such as the UK-Hungary DTA, include explicit pension fund exemption provisions. *(covered in June 2022)*

### 7. Saving Clause Exception

#### 7.1. Article 1(3) and Pensions

The saving clause in Article 1(3) of the OECD MTC 2017 preserves a Contracting State's right to tax its own residents. However, Article 18 is excepted from the saving clause.

This exception means that the source state cannot use the saving clause to override Article 18's exclusive residence allocation. If a pensioner was formerly resident in the source state and built pension entitlements there before moving to the residence state, Article 18 ensures the residence state has exclusive taxing rights. The source state cannot invoke the saving clause to tax its former resident's pension.

### 8. Practical Considerations

#### 8.1. Cross-Border Pension Contributions

An issue not fully addressed by Article 18 concerns cross-border pension contributions. When an employee contributes to a pension scheme in Country A, then moves to Country B and continues contributing, several questions arise: whether contributions are deductible in Country B, how investment returns are taxed, and how the final pension is allocated between countries.

Article 18 addresses only the taxation of pension payments when received. The contribution and accumulation phases require separate analysis under domestic law and other treaty provisions.

#### 8.2. Treaty Variations

Many bilateral treaties depart from the OECD Model. Some allow source taxation of pensions, either exclusively or with rate limitations. Others include specific social security provisions. Some provide explicit pension fund exemptions from withholding tax.

The US Model Treaty has historically included detailed pension scheme definitions and may permit source state taxation, departing from OECD's exclusive residence approach. When analysing pension taxation, reference to the specific treaty in question is essential rather than relying solely on the OECD Model.

### 9. Commentary Guidance

#### 9.1. Key Commentary Provisions

The Commentary on Article 18 provides important interpretive guidance. Paragraphs 3-5 address the meaning of "pension" and "similar remuneration," confirming that lump-sum payments and various forms of retirement benefit fall within the provision. Paragraphs 24-28 discuss social security payments and the options available to negotiating states. Paragraph 37 provides a model definition of "pension scheme" added in the 2017 update.

The 2017 addition of a pension scheme definition provides clarity for cross-border pension issues. A "pension scheme" of a Contracting State means any plan, scheme, fund, trust, or other arrangement established in that State which is generally exempt from income taxation or receives contribution deductibility, and which is operated principally to administer or provide pension or retirement benefits.

#### 9.2. BEPS Action 6 Recognition

The BEPS Action 6 Final Report explicitly addressed pension fund treaty access. It recognised that double non-taxation involving pension funds may be acceptable given their special status and confirmed that additional work would ensure pension funds are considered residents regardless of their exempt status. This recognition supports broader treaty access for pension funds and aligns with the policy goal of facilitating cross-border retirement savings.

### 10. Comparison Summary

#### 10.1. OECD vs UN Models

The fundamental difference between the OECD and UN Models concerns source state taxing rights. The OECD Model grants exclusive residence state taxation for private employment pensions, with no source state right. The UN Model offers alternatives: Alternative A mirrors the OECD approach, while Alternative B permits source state taxation either exclusively or with residence state credit.

This difference reflects broader policy tensions. OECD member countries, as predominantly capital exporters with balanced pension flows, favour residence taxation for administrative simplicity. Developing countries, often net pension sources due to expatriate workers building entitlements and retiring abroad, prefer source taxation to protect revenue.

#### 10.2. Key Distinctions

Several distinctions are critical for analysis. Article 18 applies to private employment pensions while Article 19(2) applies to government service pensions. Pensions relate to past employment while annuities without employment nexus fall under Article 21. Social security may require specific treaty provisions or fall to Article 21. Pension fund investment income raises separate issues regarding treaty access and withholding tax exemption.

Understanding these distinctions enables correct identification of the applicable treaty provision and accurate determination of taxing rights for cross-border pension situations.
