# Chapter 5.1: Interpretation of DTCs – General Approach to Interpretation

## 1. The Interpretation Challenge

### 1.1. Why Interpretation Matters

Double taxation conventions are international treaties that must be applied by domestic courts and tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. Unlike purely domestic legislation, DTCs present unique interpretive challenges arising from their bilateral nature and international law status.

Each Contracting State may interpret the same provision differently based on its legal traditions and domestic law context. Treaties often exist in multiple authentic language versions, creating potential for linguistic divergence. Economic and legal contexts evolve over the life of a treaty that may remain in force for decades. Many treaty terms are deliberately left undefined, creating ambiguity. Treaties based on the OECD and UN Models carry implicit interpretive guidance from those instruments.

The fundamental challenge in DTC interpretation is achieving consistent application across both Contracting States. Divergent interpretations can lead to either double taxation—the very problem DTCs seek to solve—or double non-taxation, creating unintended treaty benefits and opportunities for abuse.

### 1.2. The Dual Nature of Tax Treaties

Tax treaties occupy a unique position in international law. They are simultaneously international agreements subject to public international law principles, particularly the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and interstitial instruments that operate as overlays to domestic tax systems rather than as self-contained legal regimes. They represent bilateral bargains reflecting negotiated compromises between sovereign states with different tax systems and policy priorities. Most are model-based documents that draw meaning and structure from the OECD or UN Model Tax Conventions and their Commentaries. They must function as living instruments, applied to evolving commercial realities and new forms of economic activity not contemplated when the treaty was concluded.

This special character has been recognised by scholars who describe DTCs as "a special category of treaties, distinct from other types of treaties—in both implementation and modification." This distinctive nature affects how interpretation principles are applied.

## 2. The Vienna Convention Framework

### 2.1. General Rule of Interpretation (Article 31)

Tax treaties, as international agreements, are subject to the interpretation rules contained in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969. Article 31 establishes the general rule that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

The requirement of good faith interpretation is fundamental. It requires honest and reasonable interpretation adhering to the parties' common intentions, rejection of interpretations that frustrate treaty purposes, and fair dealing between Contracting States. Good faith does not permit a state to interpret provisions so as to achieve results contrary to the treaty's object or to impose additional obligations not recorded in the text.

The context for interpretation under Article 31(2) includes the text of the treaty, its preamble, and any annexes. It also encompasses any agreement relating to the treaty made between all parties in connection with its conclusion, and any instrument made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

Article 31(3) extends the interpretive context to include any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation or application of the treaty, any subsequent practice in application establishing agreement on interpretation, and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.

### 2.2. Supplementary Means of Interpretation (Article 32)

Article 32 provides for recourse to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty (travaux préparatoires) and the circumstances of its conclusion. These supplementary means may be used to confirm the meaning resulting from application of Article 31, or to determine the meaning when Article 31 interpretation leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

The OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentaries are generally classified as supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32. In the Australian High Court decision in *Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation* (1990), the court approved recourse to the OECD Model and Commentaries, observing that these documents "form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements and provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties."

### 2.3. Authentic Language Versions (Article 33)

Article 33 addresses treaties authenticated in two or more languages. The text is equally authoritative in each language unless the treaty provides that a particular text shall prevail in case of divergence. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text. When comparison of authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning not resolved by application of Articles 31 and 32, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.

This provision is particularly relevant for DTCs, which are typically concluded in the official languages of both Contracting States and sometimes in a third language (often English or French) as an additional authentic text.

## 3. Autonomous and Domestic Law Interpretation

### 3.1. The Central Interpretive Question

The central question in DTC interpretation is whether treaty terms should be given an autonomous (international) meaning—a uniform meaning derived from the treaty context, international practice, or the OECD/UN Models and Commentaries—or a domestic law meaning derived from the law of the State applying the treaty.

This choice has profound practical implications. An autonomous interpretation seeks the same meaning in both Contracting States, promoting uniformity and reducing the risk of double taxation from inconsistent interpretation. A domestic law interpretation allows each State to apply its own meaning, reflecting the interstitial nature of DTCs but potentially creating divergent results.

### 3.2. Autonomous (International) Meaning

Where the treaty context supports a uniform international meaning, courts should adopt an autonomous interpretation rather than referring to domestic law. The autonomous approach draws on the treaty text, OECD and UN Commentaries, and comparative international practice. It prioritises the object and purpose of the DTC and reduces the risk of double taxation arising from inconsistent interpretation between Contracting States.

Sources for determining an autonomous meaning include the treaty text and ordinary meaning of terms as the primary source, the OECD and UN Model Commentaries as highly persuasive authority, negotiating history and travaux préparatoires as supplementary materials, comparative case law from other jurisdictions as persuasive guidance, and academic commentary for analytical assistance.

The concept of "beneficial owner" provides an instructive example. Although undefined in DTCs, courts increasingly treat beneficial owner as having an autonomous international meaning rather than importing domestic trust law concepts. In *Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA* [2006] EWCA Civ 158, the UK Court of Appeal held that the term has "an international fiscal meaning not derived from the domestic laws of contracting states." The court applied the OECD Commentary and Conduit Company Report to conclude that beneficial ownership requires the recipient to "enjoy the full privilege to directly benefit from the income."

### 3.3. Domestic Law Reference

Under Article 3(2) of the OECD Model, where terms are not defined in the treaty and the context does not require an autonomous meaning, the applying State may reference its domestic law. This approach allows each State to apply its own meaning and reflects the interstitial nature of DTCs, which operate as overlays to domestic tax systems rather than as self-contained regimes.

The reference to domestic law under Article 3(2) specifically prioritises tax law meanings. The applying State must look first to the meaning under its domestic tax law, and only if the term is not defined in tax law may the meaning under other domestic law be applied.

### 3.4. Article 3(2): The Operative Rule

Article 3(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides that for the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State.

The words "at that time" were added in the 1995 update to confirm that Article 3(2) operates on an ambulatory basis—the meaning is determined at the time of application of the treaty, not at the time of its conclusion. This ambulatory approach allows treaties to accommodate changes in domestic law without the need for renegotiation. *(covered in June 2023)*

A limitation on the ambulatory approach is that amendments to domestic laws should not seriously alter the meaning of treaty terms as originally negotiated between the Contracting States. The Delhi High Court has ruled that amendments to domestic laws cannot alter treaty terms in ways that fundamentally change the bargain struck by the treaty parties.

## 4. Interpretive Hierarchy and Methodology

### 4.1. The Three-Step Approach

When interpreting a DTC provision, courts and practitioners follow a structured analytical sequence.

The first step is to determine whether the term is defined in the treaty. This requires checking Article 3(1) for general definitions and the specific article where the term appears for article-specific definitions. If the term is defined, the treaty definition applies.

If the term is not defined in the treaty, the second step is to consider whether the context requires an autonomous meaning. This involves examining the OECD and UN Commentaries, the object and purpose of the treaty, and comparative international practice. If the context supports an autonomous meaning, that international meaning should be applied.

Only if the term is undefined and the context does not require an autonomous meaning does the third step apply: reference to domestic law under Article 3(2). The domestic tax law meaning takes priority, with the meaning at the time of application (ambulatory approach) being applied.

### 4.2. The "Context Otherwise Requires" Test

The key phrase in Article 3(2) is "unless the context otherwise requires." This phrase determines when domestic law reference is appropriate and when an autonomous meaning must be sought.

Factors suggesting an autonomous meaning is required include guidance in the OECD Commentary on the relevant term, an established international tax meaning for the term, potential for absurd results if domestic law meanings are applied, risk of double taxation if different domestic meanings are applied in each Contracting State, and evidence from treaty negotiating history indicating a common understanding.

Factors suggesting domestic law reference is appropriate include absence of guidance in the Commentaries, a term representing a purely domestic concept with no international equivalent, treaty language expressly contemplating domestic variation, and no risk of double taxation from the application of domestic meanings.

### 4.3. Static versus Ambulatory Interpretation

A fundamental debate concerns whether to interpret treaty terms based on their meaning at the time of treaty conclusion (the static approach) or their meaning at the time of application (the ambulatory approach).

The static approach emphasises respect for the parties' original intent and legal certainty. Proponents argue that treaties should be interpreted based on what the parties understood when they negotiated and concluded the agreement.

The ambulatory approach emphasises keeping the treaty current with developments in law and practice. The explicit wording of Article 3(2), referring to the meaning "at that time" (meaning the time of application), supports this approach for domestic law references.

The current position, supported by the OECD Commentary and reflected in the 1995 amendment to Article 3(2), favours ambulatory interpretation for domestic law references. However, the question of which version of the OECD Commentary should apply remains more contested, as discussed in Chapter 5.3.

## 5. Reservations, Observations, and Positions

### 5.1. The Purpose of Departure Mechanisms

The OECD Model Tax Convention includes mechanisms for countries to express departures from the standard provisions and interpretations. These mechanisms allow agreement on the basic structure and approach of the Model while accommodating the diversity of national tax systems and policy preferences among member and non-member countries. *(covered in December 2023)*

### 5.2. Reservations by OECD Members

Reservations are stated views of OECD member countries regarding provisions of the OECD Model with which they disagree or wish to modify. A reservation signals the member's intention to deviate from the Model text in treaty negotiations. Reservations relate to the Article text itself, not to Commentary interpretations, and are located within the Commentary on the relevant Article.

The 2017 OECD Model contained 226 reservations. The highest concentrations were on Article 5 (29 reservations), Article 10 (22 reservations), and Article 13 (20 reservations). Articles 26 through 28 had no reservations.

Reservations permit a country to communicate the fact that they wish to leave open the possibility of adopting a position that may differ from the standard position. Whilst the inclusion of a reservation may signal disagreement with a relevant provision, countries may also make reservations because their domestic tax law or constitution may not permit them to adopt the relevant treaty wording.

### 5.3. Observations on Commentary

Observations are stated views of OECD member countries regarding the Commentary interpretation with which they disagree. Unlike reservations, observations do not express disagreement with the Article text itself. The Introduction to the OECD Model at paragraph 30 states that observations "usefully indicate the way in which those countries will apply the provisions of the Article in question."

Observations may be interpretive, expressing disagreement with a particular Commentary interpretation, or non-interpretive, communicating a domestic law position that may prevent the country from applying a particular interpretation. For example, certain countries have observed that they do not share the interpretation regarding when electronic servers may constitute permanent establishments.

### 5.4. Positions of Non-OECD Members

Positions are stated views of non-OECD members regarding both the OECD Model provisions and the Commentary. They are made by non-OECD countries participating in the OECD's work as observers or associated countries. Positions are located in a separate section at the end of the OECD Model and importantly do not form part of the Commentary.

This location difference is significant: because positions do not form part of the Commentary, they generally carry lower interpretive weight than reservations and observations made by OECD members. Major developing economies including India, China, and Brazil have registered positions on various articles.

### 5.5. Interpretive Significance

Where a country has entered a reservation or observation contrary to OECD guidance, the Commentary guidance is not applicable to that country's treaties. This principle was applied in the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in *Canada v Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L.* [2021] SCC 49, where Luxembourg's observation disagreeing with post-treaty Commentary changes proved determinative. The Court held that the relevant DTC could not be interpreted in line with OECD Commentaries that postdate the treaty where the contracting state had registered an observation contrary to those Commentaries.

## 6. Key Case Law on Interpretation

### 6.1. Alta Energy (Canada, 2021)

The Supreme Court of Canada's decision in *Canada v Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L.* (2021 SCC 49) represents the leading modern authority on treaty interpretation and the static/ambulatory debate. Luxembourg entity Alta claimed benefits under the Canada-Luxembourg treaty signed in 1999. The Crown sought to rely on 2003 revisions to the OECD Commentary on Article 1.

The majority held that Commentaries postdating the treaty cannot be relied upon to introduce terms that modify the treaty. To do so would effectively amend the treaty in a manner not agreed upon by the parties. The Court emphasised that Luxembourg had registered an observation disagreeing with the 2003 Commentary changes, making reliance on those later Commentaries inappropriate.

The decision affirmed the "high persuasive value" of the OECD Model and Commentaries while establishing limits on the use of post-treaty Commentary. Soft law may be relevant provided the ideas it contains could have been considered by the contracting states at the time of negotiation.

### 6.2. Indofood (UK, 2006)

In *Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA* [2006] EWCA Civ 158, the UK Court of Appeal addressed the meaning of "beneficial owner" in the Indonesia-Mauritius treaty. The Court held that the term has an "international fiscal meaning not derived from the domestic laws of contracting states."

The Court applied the OECD Commentary and Conduit Company Report to conclude that beneficial ownership requires the recipient to enjoy the full privilege to directly benefit from the income. An intermediary or conduit company that simply passes on funds collected under the same conditions does not satisfy this requirement. This case established the autonomous international approach to beneficial ownership interpretation.

### 6.3. Prévost Car (Canada, 2009)

In *Prévost Car Inc v The Queen* [2009] FCA 57, the Federal Court of Appeal addressed beneficial ownership in the context of dividends paid to a Netherlands holding company. The Court held that the "beneficial owner" of dividends is the person who receives the dividends for their own use and enjoyment and assumes the risk and control of the dividend received.

The Court concluded that OECD Commentary and the Conduit Companies Report are "a helpful complement to the earlier Commentaries, insofar as they are eliciting, rather than contradicting, views previously expressed." This formulation captures the distinction between Commentary that clarifies and Commentary that changes interpretation.

### 6.4. Thiel (Australia, 1990)

The High Court of Australia in *Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation* (1990) established the foundational authority for treating OECD Commentary as supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT. The Court observed that the OECD Model and Commentaries "form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements and provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties."

This classification has been widely followed internationally and provides the standard framework for understanding the legal status of OECD Commentary in treaty interpretation.

### 6.5. Fowler (UK, 2020)

The UK Supreme Court in *Fowler v HMRC* [2020] UKSC 22 addressed the interpretation of the employment income article. The Court confirmed that OECD Commentaries postdating a particular treaty should be given consideration in interpretation, following the UK's traditionally ambulatory inclination. The Court held that post-treaty Commentaries should be given "such persuasive force as aids to interpretation as the cogency of their reasoning deserves."

### 6.6. German Federal Tax Court (2023)

In its decision of 5 December 2023, the German Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) reinforced the static approach, ruling that a version of the OECD Commentary that did not exist before the treaty came into force cannot be relied upon. This contradicts the official position of the German tax authorities expressed in a 2023 Ministry of Finance decree favouring ambulatory interpretation—creating tension between judicial and administrative approaches within Germany.

## 7. The OECD Commentary in Treaty Interpretation

### 7.1. Nature and Purpose

The Commentaries accompany each Article of the OECD Model and provide guidance for treaty application. They explain Article provisions and their rationale, offer guidance on practical application, provide examples and illustrations for ambiguous terms, present alternative provisions, and document changes across different versions.

The Commentaries are not part of the treaty text itself. They serve as an interpretive guide but do not constitute binding legal obligations. This distinction has significant implications for how courts may use them when interpreting actual bilateral treaties.

### 7.2. Legal Status

The Commentaries possess the same soft law character as the Model itself—they are not legally binding. The Introduction to the OECD Model acknowledges at paragraph 29 that the Commentaries are not a legally binding document. As the UK courts have observed, "subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."

Most authorities classify the Commentaries under Article 32 VCLT as supplementary means of interpretation. The practical consequence is that courts generally treat the Commentaries as persuasive but non-binding guidance, with their weight depending on factors including the cogency of their reasoning, whether the treaty provision follows the Model wording, and whether the relevant country has registered reservations or observations.

### 7.3. Static versus Ambulatory Application

A central controversy concerns which version of the Commentary applies when interpreting a treaty. The static approach holds that only the Commentary version existing when the treaty was signed applies, respecting the parties' shared understanding at negotiation. The ambulatory approach permits later Commentary versions to inform interpretation, arguing that Commentary clarifies existing meaning rather than changing it.

The OECD position, set out in paragraphs 33-37 of the Introduction, essentially advocates for the ambulatory approach. It states that subsequent modifications to the Commentary should normally be followed since they reflect the consensus of OECD member countries as to proper interpretation. However, this is qualified by the important caveat that ambulatory application would not be appropriate where modifications have "changed the conclusions" of the Commentary rather than merely clarified them.

### 7.4. National Approaches

National courts have adopted divergent approaches to the static/ambulatory question. Canada adopted a largely static approach in *Alta Energy*. The UK follows an ambulatory approach, confirmed in *Fowler*. Germany's Federal Tax Court maintains a static approach, contradicting the Finance Ministry's administrative position. Australia takes a mixed approach following *Thiel*, treating Commentaries as Article 32 supplementary means. The Netherlands applies a case-by-case "limited dynamic interpretation."

This divergence among major jurisdictions means that the same treaty provision may be interpreted differently depending on which country's courts are considering it—creating practical uncertainty for taxpayers and tax authorities alike.

## 8. The Impact of BEPS and the MLI on Interpretation

### 8.1. Changes to the Object and Purpose

The BEPS Project has fundamentally affected treaty interpretation by revising the stated object and purpose of tax treaties. The OECD Model 2017 Preamble now expressly states that the treaty is intended to eliminate double taxation "without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this Convention for the indirect benefit of residents of third States)."

This revised Preamble affects interpretation of all treaty provisions. The prevention of abuse is now explicitly recognised as a co-equal objective alongside the elimination of double taxation. Courts must consider both objectives when applying interpretive principles.

### 8.2. Increased Complexity

The BEPS Project has been described as introducing both soft law (BEPS Final Reports, updated Commentary) and hard law (the Multilateral Instrument, domestic implementing legislation) into the international tax framework. This multiplication of interpretive sources has added complexity to DTC interpretation. *(covered in June 2024)*

The MLI modifies existing treaty provisions through a complex matching mechanism. Questions arise about the relationship between MLI provisions, the Explanatory Statement to the MLI, the underlying treaty text, and the OECD Commentary. The Explanatory Statement's legal status is contested—it may qualify as an agreement related to the treaty under Article 31(2)(a) VCLT for members of the ad hoc group that drafted the MLI, or as a supplementary means under Article 32 more broadly.

### 8.3. The Principal Purpose Test

The Principal Purpose Test in Article 7 of the MLI (and Article 29 of the OECD Model 2017) creates new interpretive challenges. The PPT denies treaty benefits where one of the principal purposes of an arrangement was to obtain a benefit, unless granting the benefit would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty provisions.

This inherently requires interpretation of object and purpose at both the treaty and provision level. The subjective and objective elements of the PPT, and the scope of the proviso regarding accordance with object and purpose, generate significant interpretive uncertainty.

## 9. Qualification Conflicts and Resolution

### 9.1. The Problem of Divergent Characterisation

A qualification conflict arises when Contracting States characterise the same income differently for treaty purposes. For example, State A may treat a payment as interest under Article 11 while State B treats the same payment as dividends under Article 10. Such conflicts can result in either double taxation (if both states claim taxing rights) or double non-taxation (if neither state taxes the income).

The causes of qualification conflicts include different domestic law characterisations of the same legal relationship, different interpretations of treaty terms, and changes in domestic law under the ambulatory approach that affect characterisation.

### 9.2. Approaches to Resolution

Several approaches to resolving qualification conflicts have been proposed. Autonomous qualification requires both states to derive a common characterisation from the treaty context, achieving uniformity but not always practically achievable. Source state qualification applies the characterisation determined by the state where the income arises, providing certainty but potentially allowing the source state to control treaty outcomes through domestic law changes. Residence state qualification applies the characterisation determined by the state of the recipient's residence. Lex fori qualification allows each state to apply its own characterisation, which can produce inconsistent results.

### 9.3. OECD Guidance

The OECD Commentary generally favours source state characterisation for the distributive rules, reasoning that the source state's law determines what type of income arises within its territory. However, qualification conflicts remain a challenging interpretive issue without a universally accepted solution. The Mutual Agreement Procedure under Article 25 provides a mechanism for competent authorities to resolve specific cases of qualification conflict.
