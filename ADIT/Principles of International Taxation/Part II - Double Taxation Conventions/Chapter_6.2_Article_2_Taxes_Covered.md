## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE MATERIAL SCOPE

### 1.1 Purpose of Article 2

While Article 1 defines the **personal scope** (who is covered), Article 2 defines the **material scope** (what taxes are covered). Together, these provisions determine the boundaries of a DTC's application.

**Key question Article 2 answers**:
> **"Which taxes fall within the scope of this treaty?"**

### 1.2 Why Material Scope Matters

Understanding Article 2 is critical because:
- DTCs only apply to **covered taxes**—not all taxes
- New taxes (e.g., digital services taxes) may or may not be covered
- Some provisions (e.g., exchange of information, non-discrimination) may have broader scope
- Errors in identifying covered taxes can invalidate treaty analysis

## 3. ARTICLE 2(1)-(2): DEFINING COVERED TAXES

### 3.1 "Taxes on Income and on Capital"

The core requirement is that the tax must be imposed on **income** or **capital**:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Taxes on income** | Corporate income tax, personal income tax, withholding taxes on dividends/interest/royalties |
| **Taxes on capital** | Net wealth tax, property tax, inheritance tax (in some models) |
| **Taxes on elements of income** | Tax on specific types of income (rental income, business profits) |
| **Taxes on elements of capital** | Tax on specific assets (real property, securities) |

### 3.2 What Makes a Tax "On Income or Capital"?

**Commentary [2]-[3]** provides guidance:

The key test is the **basis of the tax**—is it computed on income or capital, or some element thereof?

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.3 Taxes NOT Covered

| Tax Type | Why Not Covered |
|----------|-----------------|
| **VAT/GST** | Tax on consumption, not income or capital |
| **Customs duties** | Tax on imports, not income or capital |
| **Excise duties** | Tax on specific goods, not income or capital |
| **Stamp duties** (generally) | Tax on transactions, not income or capital (but see exceptions) |
| **Social security contributions** | Usually not covered (but see Commentary [3]) |

**Exception**: Some bilateral treaties specifically include or exclude certain taxes.

### 3.4 Commentary Guidance

**Commentary [2]**:
> *"The Convention applies to taxes on income and on capital. It is immaterial on behalf of which authorities, whether the State itself or its political subdivisions or local authorities, the tax is levied."*

**Commentary [3]** on social security contributions:
> *"As regards compulsory contributions to social security schemes... the question of whether or not such contributions fall within the scope of the Convention will depend on the characteristics of each scheme..."*

---

## 4. ARTICLE 2(3): EXISTING TAXES

### 4.1 Purpose of the Enumeration

Article 2(3) requires each Contracting State to **list** the existing taxes to which the Convention applies. This serves several purposes:
- Provides **legal certainty** about which taxes are covered
- Acts as a **snapshot** at the time of signature
- Uses "in particular" = **non-exhaustive** list

### 4.2 Typical Taxes Listed

| State | Typical Taxes Listed |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Most countries** | Income tax, corporation tax |
| **Some countries** | Local income taxes, capital gains tax |
| **Countries with net wealth taxes** | Wealth tax, property tax |

### 4.3 "In Particular"

The phrase "in particular" in Article 2(3) is important:
- The list is **illustrative**, not exhaustive
- Other taxes meeting the Article 2(1)-(2) criteria are also covered
- Provides flexibility for unlisted taxes

---

## 5. ARTICLE 2(4): FUTURE TAXES

### 5.1 The Continuity Principle

Article 2(4) ensures that DTCs remain relevant as tax systems evolve:
- Treaties would become obsolete if they only covered taxes existing at signature
- New taxes that are "identical or substantially similar" are automatically covered
- No need to renegotiate the treaty for every tax change

### 5.2 "Identical or Substantially Similar"

This is the **key interpretive issue** under Article 2:

```

│         "IDENTICAL OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR" TEST               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  IDENTICAL:                                                     │
│  • Same tax with different name                                 │
│  • Merger of existing taxes into one                            │
│  • Clear replacement of existing tax                            │
│                                                                 │
│  SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR:                                         │
│  • Same base (income or capital)                                │
│  • Same or similar methodology                                  │
│  • Same or similar purpose                                      │
│  • Imposed in addition to or in place of existing tax           │
│                                                                 │
│  NOT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR:                                     │
│  • Different tax base entirely                                  │
│  • Novel methodology unrelated to income/capital                │
│  • Different fiscal purpose                                     │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5.3 Commentary Guidance on Article 2(4)

**Commentary [8]**:
> *"Paragraph 4 provides that the Convention applies also to taxes that are imposed after the signature of the Convention in a Contracting State in addition to, or in place of, an existing tax of that State if such taxes are identical or substantially similar to the existing taxes..."*

The Commentary emphasizes:
- The test is whether the **new tax** is identical or substantially similar to **existing taxes**
- Not whether the new tax is covered by the general definition in Article 2(1)-(2)
- This creates potential gaps for truly novel taxes

### 5.4 Notification Obligation

Article 2(4) second sentence requires:
> *"The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws."*

This ensures:
- Both States are aware of changes
- Disputes about coverage can be addressed promptly
- Transparency in treaty application

## 6. CONTEMPORARY ISSUE: DIGITAL SERVICES TAXES

### 6.1 The Challenge

Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) present a significant challenge for Article 2:
- Are DSTs "taxes on income" or something else?
- Are they "substantially similar" to existing income taxes?
- If not covered, what are the implications?

### 6.2 June 2023 Exam Reference

The June 2023 exam explicitly addressed this issue:
> *"Whether [a tax] is a 'covered tax' for DTA purposes and more specifically whether it is an 'identical or substantially similar tax' for the purposes of Article 2."* (Rajgopalan, 2020)

### 6.3 Arguments For and Against Coverage

| DSTs ARE Covered | DSTs Are NOT Covered |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Ultimately a tax on income earned from digital services | Calculated on gross revenue, not income |
| Similar purpose to income tax (taxing business profits) | No deduction for expenses |
| Imposed in addition to existing income taxes | Novel methodology not related to income taxes |
| Some DSTs use turnover as proxy for profit | Base is revenue/turnover, not income or capital |

### 6.4 Practical Implications

If a DST is **NOT** a covered tax:
- No treaty relief available
- No limitation on source State's taxing rights
- No double taxation relief under Article 23
- BUT: Non-discrimination (Article 24) may still apply (broader scope)

If a DST **IS** a covered tax:
- Treaty applies normally
- Source State taxing rights may be limited
- Double taxation relief available

---

## 7. BROADER SCOPE FOR CERTAIN ARTICLES

### 7.1 Articles with Extended Material Scope

Some treaty provisions apply to taxes **beyond** those covered by Article 2:

| Article | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| **Article 24 (Non-discrimination)** | May apply to "taxes of every kind and description" (paragraph 6) |
| **Article 26 (Exchange of Information)** | May apply to "taxes of every kind" (in many treaties) |
| **Article 27 (Assistance in Collection)** | May extend beyond income/capital taxes |

### 7.2 US Model Approach

The US Model takes a **different approach** to Article 2:
- Does not contain a general description of covered taxes
- Only lists **specific taxes** for each State
- Separate broader provisions for Articles 24 and 26

---

## 8. ARTICLE 2: UN MDTC DIFFERENCES

### 8.1 Comparison

| Element | OECD MTC | UN MDTC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Paragraph 1** | Taxes on income and capital | Identical |
| **Paragraph 2** | Definition | Identical |
| **Paragraph 3** | Existing taxes listed | Identical approach |
| **Paragraph 4** | Future taxes | Identical |

The UN Model follows the OECD structure closely for Article 2.

### 8.2 Developing Country Considerations

Developing countries may have:
- More varied tax structures
- More frequent tax reforms
- Greater reliance on transaction taxes (customs, excise) not covered by DTCs

---

## 9. EXAM APPLICATION

### 9.1 How Article 2 Appears in Exams

Article 2 typically appears in:
1. **DTC application scenarios** – confirming the tax is covered before analysis
2. **New/novel tax questions** – is a DST or similar tax covered?
3. **Treaty interpretation questions** – meaning of "substantially similar"

### 9.3 Common Exam Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Assuming all taxes are covered | Only taxes on income and capital are covered |
| Ignoring Article 2 in DTC analysis | Always confirm material scope before applying treaty |
| Treating Article 2(3) as exhaustive | "In particular" means illustrative, not exhaustive |
| Applying Article 2(4) incorrectly | Test is similarity to existing taxes, not to general definition |

*This note covers syllabus topic II.F.2: Article 2: Taxes Covered (Level 3). Article 2 defines the material scope of a DTC, specifying that the Convention applies to taxes on income and on capital. The key interpretive issue is whether new taxes (particularly digital services taxes) are "identical or substantially similar" to existing taxes under Article 2(4). Some provisions like non-discrimination and exchange of information may have broader material scope.*
