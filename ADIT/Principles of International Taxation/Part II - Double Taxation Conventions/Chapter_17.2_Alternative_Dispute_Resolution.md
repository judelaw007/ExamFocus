## Chapter 17.2: Alternative Means of Resolving International Tax Disputes

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. The Need for Alternative Mechanisms

While the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) under Article 25 provides the primary treaty-based mechanism for resolving international tax disputes, its limitations have prompted the development of alternative and supplementary mechanisms. The traditional MAP's best-endeavours approach does not guarantee resolution, and complex cases may remain unresolved for years. These challenges have driven innovation in international tax dispute resolution, producing a range of mechanisms that complement or extend beyond the basic MAP framework.

The growing complexity of international taxation, particularly in transfer pricing, has increased both the volume and difficulty of cross-border disputes. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating across multiple jurisdictions face heightened risks of inconsistent treatment by different tax authorities. This environment has created demand for mechanisms that provide greater certainty, faster resolution, or both.

#### 1.2. Spectrum of Dispute Resolution Options

International tax disputes may be addressed through various mechanisms along a spectrum from prevention to resolution. At one end, advance pricing agreements and cooperative compliance programmes seek to prevent disputes before they arise. At the other end, mandatory binding arbitration provides a guaranteed resolution mechanism when competent authorities cannot agree. Between these extremes lie enhanced MAP procedures, mediation, and specialised regional mechanisms such as the EU Dispute Resolution Directive.

The choice among these mechanisms depends on factors including the nature of the dispute, the jurisdictions involved, the taxpayer's risk tolerance, and the time and resources available. Understanding each mechanism's strengths and limitations is essential for effective dispute management.

### 2. Arbitration

#### 2.1. Treaty-Based Arbitration Under Article 25(5)

Article 25(5) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides for mandatory binding arbitration where competent authorities are unable to reach agreement under the MAP within two years. The taxpayer must request arbitration in writing, and the arbitration decision is binding on both Contracting States unless the taxpayer rejects the mutual agreement implementing the decision.

Arbitration under Article 25(5) addresses the fundamental weakness of the traditional MAP—the absence of guaranteed resolution. By providing a default to arbitration when competent authorities cannot agree, the mechanism ensures that disputes will ultimately be resolved rather than remaining indefinitely unresolved.

However, arbitration is not available in all circumstances. If a court or administrative tribunal of either State has already rendered a decision on the disputed issues, those issues cannot be submitted to arbitration. This limitation preserves the primacy of domestic judicial determinations.

#### 2.2. MLI Part VI Arbitration

The Multilateral Instrument (MLI) introduced a mechanism for countries to adopt mandatory binding arbitration through a single multilateral action rather than renegotiating bilateral treaties individually. Part VI of the MLI (Articles 18-26) contains the arbitration provisions, which apply where both treaty partners have opted into this part of the MLI. *(covered in June 2024)*

Countries may choose to adopt Part VI in whole or in part, and may make reservations limiting its application to certain categories of cases. The MLI approach significantly expands the availability of arbitration by allowing countries to introduce arbitration provisions across multiple treaties simultaneously.

As of late 2024, adoption of Part VI remains uneven. Many developed countries have opted into the arbitration provisions, while developing countries have generally been more cautious. The effectiveness of MLI arbitration therefore depends on the specific treaty relationships between the countries involved in a dispute.

#### 2.3. Types of Arbitration Process

Article 23 of the MLI provides for two types of arbitration process:

**Final Offer Arbitration (Baseball Arbitration)**: This is the default approach. Each competent authority submits a proposed resolution addressing all unresolved issues, and the arbitration panel must select one of the two proposals in its entirety. The panel cannot devise its own solution or select elements from both proposals. This approach encourages competent authorities to submit reasonable positions, as extreme positions risk being rejected in favour of the opposing proposal.

**Independent Opinion Arbitration**: Countries may reserve the right to apply this alternative approach. Under independent opinion arbitration, the panel is not limited to choosing between the competent authorities' proposals but may deliver a reasoned decision addressing the issues in dispute. This approach more closely resembles traditional arbitration but provides less incentive for competent authorities to moderate their positions.

Most countries that have adopted Part VI have accepted final offer arbitration as the default. Only a small number of jurisdictions, including Japan and Malta, have opted for independent opinion arbitration in certain treaty relationships.

Arbitration decisions have no precedential value beyond the specific case and are kept confidential. Information provided during arbitration proceedings receives the same protection as information obtained under normal competent authority procedures.

### 3. Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)

#### 3.1. Purpose and Function

Advance Pricing Agreements represent a preventive approach to international tax disputes, particularly in transfer pricing. An APA is a prospective agreement between a taxpayer and one or more tax administrations that determines the appropriate transfer pricing methodology for specified transactions over a defined period, typically three to five years.

By agreeing the methodology in advance, APAs eliminate the risk of subsequent disputes over the covered transactions. This provides certainty for taxpayers and reduces examination burdens for tax administrations. APAs are particularly valuable for complex or high-value transactions where the risk of inconsistent treatment by different jurisdictions is significant.

#### 3.2. Types of APAs

APAs may be unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral:

**Unilateral APAs** involve agreement between the taxpayer and a single tax administration. While simpler to negotiate, unilateral APAs do not bind other jurisdictions and may not prevent double taxation if another jurisdiction takes a different view of the appropriate transfer pricing methodology.

**Bilateral APAs** involve the taxpayer and two tax administrations, typically the jurisdictions at both ends of the covered transactions. The competent authorities negotiate through the MAP framework to reach a consistent approach. Bilateral APAs provide protection against double taxation between the participating jurisdictions.

**Multilateral APAs** extend bilateral APAs to three or more jurisdictions, providing coordinated certainty across multiple treaty relationships. While more complex to negotiate, multilateral APAs address the reality that many MNE transfer pricing structures involve multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.

The APA process typically takes three to four years for bilateral agreements, reflecting the complexity of negotiating agreed methodologies across jurisdictions. This timeline contrasts with the faster but less certain approaches offered by newer mechanisms.

### 4. EU Dispute Resolution Mechanism

The EU Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism, established by Directive 2017/1852, provides an enhanced framework for resolving tax disputes between EU Member States. The Directive has been in force since 1 July 2019 and applies to disputes concerning the interpretation and application of tax treaties and the EU Arbitration Convention.

The mechanism operates in stages. Initially, taxpayers may submit complaints to the competent authorities, who must endeavour to resolve the dispute through a MAP-like process within two years (extendable to three years). If the MAP does not resolve the dispute, the taxpayer may request the establishment of an Advisory Commission.

The Advisory Commission comprises representatives of the competent authorities and independent persons drawn from a maintained list. The Commission delivers an opinion on how to resolve the dispute, and the competent authorities must either accept the opinion or reach a different agreement within six months. If they fail to do so, the Advisory Commission's opinion becomes binding.

This structure addresses the traditional MAP's non-binding nature by providing a default to a binding resolution mechanism. The EU framework thus offers taxpayers within the EU a guaranteed path to resolution, even where competent authorities cannot reach agreement through normal channels. *(covered in December 2023)*

### 5. International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP)

The International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP) represents an innovative approach to providing tax certainty through multilateral cooperative risk assessment. Developed by the OECD, ICAP enables MNE groups to engage with multiple tax administrations simultaneously to obtain assurance regarding the compliance risk level of their cross-border transactions.

Unlike APAs, ICAP does not provide legally binding certainty. Rather, it offers "comfort letters" indicating that participating tax administrations consider the covered transactions to present low compliance risk. This lower level of certainty is balanced by significantly faster timelines—typically 6 to 12 months compared to three to four years for bilateral APAs.

ICAP is particularly suited to MNEs with relatively straightforward transfer pricing structures that are consistently applied across multiple jurisdictions. The programme focuses on transfer pricing and permanent establishment risks, addressing the areas that generate the largest proportion of international tax disputes.

The relationship between ICAP and other mechanisms is complementary. Issues identified during ICAP that cannot be resolved may be addressed through APAs, examinations, or MAP. Transactions already covered by pending or completed bilateral APAs are excluded from ICAP review.

### 6. Other Alternatives

#### 6.1. Mediation

Mediation involves the use of a neutral third party to facilitate agreement between disputing parties. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not produce a binding decision—the mediator assists the parties in reaching their own resolution.

Tax mediation remains relatively uncommon internationally. Only a small number of countries, including the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, and Greece, offer government-provided mediation in tax disputes. Germany has conducted pilot programmes in certain regions. The limited adoption reflects both the complexity of international tax disputes and the traditional preference for bilateral negotiation between competent authorities.

Where available, mediation may help resolve disputes that have become deadlocked due to positional bargaining or communication difficulties. The presence of a neutral third party can help parties identify creative solutions and move beyond entrenched positions.

#### 6.2. Investor-State Arbitration

International investment treaties increasingly provide for investor-state arbitration, which may encompass tax measures that allegedly violate investment protections such as fair and equitable treatment or expropriation standards. The number of tax-related investor-state arbitration cases has grown significantly, more than doubling between 2010 and 2021 according to United Nations data.

Investor-state arbitration operates outside the tax treaty framework and applies different legal standards. While tax treaties address the allocation of taxing rights between states, investment treaties protect investors against certain government actions that harm their investments. Tax measures may potentially engage both frameworks simultaneously.

The growth of investor-state arbitration in tax matters has raised concerns about the interaction between investment law and tax sovereignty. Some recent investment treaties include carve-outs or limitations for tax measures, reflecting efforts to clarify the boundary between legitimate taxation and compensable expropriation.

### 7. Choosing Among Mechanisms

#### 7.1. Factors Influencing Selection

The choice among dispute resolution mechanisms involves weighing several factors. For prospective certainty on transfer pricing, APAs offer the strongest protection but require significant time investment—typically three to four years for bilateral agreements. ICAP provides faster assurance with less formal certainty, suiting MNEs with straightforward structures seeking quick confirmation of their approach.

For disputes that have already arisen, the traditional MAP remains the primary avenue, with arbitration providing a backstop where competent authorities cannot agree. Within the EU, the Dispute Resolution Mechanism offers enhanced guarantees of resolution. The specific mechanism available depends on the treaty provisions between the relevant jurisdictions.

#### 7.2. Complementary Use

These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. An MNE might use ICAP for initial assurance, pursue APAs for high-risk transactions, and resort to MAP and arbitration if disputes nonetheless arise. The OECD's work on tax certainty has emphasised the importance of a coherent ecosystem of mechanisms that work together rather than in isolation.

The trend in international tax dispute resolution is toward greater certainty and more reliable resolution pathways. While the traditional MAP remains important, the development of binding arbitration, enhanced regional mechanisms, and preventive programmes has significantly expanded the options available to taxpayers and tax administrations alike.
