## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE GATEWAY TO TREATY BENEFITS

### 1.1 Purpose of Article 1

Article 1 is the **gateway provision** of every DTC. It defines who can access treaty benefits by establishing the personal scope of the convention. Before any substantive treaty provision (distributive rules, relief methods, etc.) can apply, the person must first satisfy Article 1.

The fundamental question Article 1 answers:
> **"Who is entitled to invoke the provisions of this treaty?"**

### 1.2 Position in DTC Structure

Article 1 operates as the **first filter** in applying a DTC:

## 2. ARTICLE 1 TEXT AND STRUCTURE

### 2.1 Full Text (OECD MTC 2017)

**Article 1(1)**:
> *"This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States."*

**Article 1(2)**:
> *"For the purposes of this Convention, income derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income of a resident of that State."*

**Article 1(3)**:
> *"This Convention shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents except with respect to the benefits granted under paragraph 3 of Article 7, paragraph 2 of Article 9 and Articles 19, 20, 23 [A] [B], 24, 25 and 28."*

## 3. ARTICLE 1(1): PERSONAL SCOPE

### 3.1 Key Elements

**"Persons"**: Defined in Article 3(1)(a) as:
- An individual
- A company
- Any other body of persons

**"Residents"**: Defined in Article 4:
- Liable to tax by reason of domicile, residence, place of management, or similar criterion
- Excludes persons taxed only on source-basis income

**"One or both Contracting States"**:
- Most provisions require residence in ONE State
- Some provisions (e.g., non-discrimination) may apply to residents of both

### 3.2 The Resident Requirement

The residence requirement is crucial because DTCs are designed to resolve conflicts between:
- **Residence State** (State where person is resident)
- **Source State** (State where income arises)

If a person is not resident in either Contracting State, the treaty simply does not apply to them. This is the first and most fundamental filter.

### 3.3 Relationship with Article 4

Article 1 and Article 4 work together:

| Article | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Article 1** | Establishes that the treaty applies to residents |
| **Article 4(1)** | Defines what "resident" means for treaty purposes |
| **Article 4(2)** | Resolves dual residence for individuals (tie-breaker) |
| **Article 4(3)** | Resolves dual residence for entities (CA determination) |

**Commentary [1]**: *"The Convention is applicable to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. The definition of 'resident of a Contracting State' is found in Article 4."*

---

## 4. ARTICLE 1(2): FISCALLY TRANSPARENT ENTITIES

### 4.1 Background and Purpose

Prior to 2017, DTCs were silent on fiscally transparent entities (partnerships, LLPs, trusts, etc.), creating significant uncertainty and potential for:
- **Double taxation** (both entity and members taxed, neither getting relief)
- **Double non-taxation** (neither entity nor members taxed)

Article 1(2), added in the 2017 update, codifies principles from the 1999 OECD Partnership Report.

### 4.2 What Are Fiscally Transparent Entities?

**Definition**: Entities or arrangements where income is not taxed at the entity level but instead "flows through" to be taxed in the hands of the members/participants.

**Examples**:
- Partnership firms
- Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)
- Certain trusts
- Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) electing disregarded status
- Sociétés en nom collectif (France)
- Offene Handelsgesellschaft (Germany)

### 4.3 How Article 1(2) Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        ARTICLE 1(2) - FISCALLY TRANSPARENT ENTITIES             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  KEY PRINCIPLE:                                                 │
│  Income "derived by or through" a transparent entity is         │
│  treated as income of a resident of a Contracting State         │
│  BUT ONLY to the extent that the income is treated as           │
│  income of that resident for taxation purposes                  │
│                                                                 │
│  EXAMPLE:                                                       │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  Partnership P (State A) ← Income from State B                  │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  Partner X (resident of State A, 50% share)                     │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  If State A treats X as taxable on 50% of P's income:           │
│  → X may claim treaty benefits on that 50%                      │
│  → Treaty applies because income is "treated as income          │
│    of a resident of State A for purposes of taxation"           │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.4 Conflict Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Transparent in Source State, Opaque in Residence State**
- Source State sees income as belonging to partners
- Residence State sees income as belonging to entity
- **Risk**: Neither provides relief → double taxation

**Scenario 2: Opaque in Source State, Transparent in Residence State**
- Source State taxes the entity
- Residence State taxes the partners
- **Risk**: Entity claims relief in Source State, partners claim relief in Residence State → double non-taxation or confusion

Article 1(2) addresses these by looking to how the **residence State** treats the income for tax purposes.

### 4.5 Key Case: General Motors Company USA v. ACIT (2024)

In this recent Indian case, the Delhi ITAT held that a US LLC electing to be treated as a disregarded entity for US tax purposes was entitled to India-US treaty benefits. The Tribunal found:
- The LLC qualifies as a "person" under the treaty
- It meets the "liable to tax" requirement under Article 4
- Treaty benefits flow to the US parent treating the LLC's income as its own

---

## 5. ARTICLE 1(3): THE SAVING CLAUSE

### 5.1 Purpose

The saving clause preserves each Contracting State's right to tax its **own residents** without limitation from the treaty. It reflects the principle that DTCs primarily limit **source State** taxation, not residence State taxation.

### 5.2 The Clause Explained

**Article 1(3)**: The Convention shall **not affect** the taxation by a Contracting State of its residents...

This means:
- State A can tax its own residents on worldwide income
- The DTC doesn't prevent this
- The DTC primarily limits what State B (source) can tax

### 5.3 Exceptions to the Saving Clause

The saving clause is subject to important exceptions:

| Exception Article | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Article 7(3)** | Deduction of expenses for PE |
| **Article 9(2)** | Corresponding adjustment for transfer pricing |
| **Article 19** | Government service |
| **Article 20** | Students |
| **Article 23A/23B** | Relief from double taxation |
| **Article 24** | Non-discrimination |
| **Article 25** | Mutual agreement procedure |
| **Article 28** | Diplomatic agents and consular officers |

**Why these exceptions?** These provisions would be meaningless if the residence State could simply override them by taxing its own residents.

### 5.4 Reservations on Saving Clause

Notable reservations on Article 1(3):

| Country | Reservation |
|---------|-------------|
| **United States** | Broader saving clause—reserves right to tax citizens and residents (including former citizens and long-term residents) without regard to the Convention, with certain exceptions |
| **France** | Has made reservations regarding Article 1(3) |
| **Germany** | Has made reservations regarding Article 1(3) |
| **Ireland** | Has made reservations regarding Article 1(3) |
| **Hungary** | Has made reservations regarding Article 1(3) |

The US reservation is particularly important for US citizens living abroad, who remain subject to US taxation despite treaty provisions.

## 6. ARTICLE 1 AND TREATY ABUSE

### 6.1 Connection to Anti-Abuse Framework

Article 1 works with other provisions to prevent treaty abuse:

### 6.2 Key Case: Alta Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg (2021)

This Canadian Supreme Court case is essential for understanding Article 1 in the treaty abuse context.

**Facts**:
- Luxembourg company (Alta Energy) held shares in Canadian company
- Sold shares at substantial capital gain
- Canada sought to tax the gain
- Alta claimed exemption under Canada-Luxembourg treaty

**Majority (6:3)**:
- Object of Articles 1 and 4 is to allow **all persons** who are residents under the laws of a Contracting State to claim treaty benefits
- Residence need only create **potential** for comprehensive liability
- No implicit "substance" requirement should be read into Articles 1 and 4
- Declined to deny treaty benefits based on lack of economic substance in Luxembourg

**Minority**:
- Object of DTA is to assign taxing rights to State with **closest economic connection**
- Alta had no genuine economic connection with Luxembourg
- Was "a mere conduit interposed in Luxembourg for residents of third party states"

**Commentary [1] Analysis** (December 2023 exam reference):
*"While the OECD MTC recognizes residence as a tax nexus... the mere fact of being a resident of a Contracting State does not automatically entitle a person to DTA benefits."*

### 6.3 Implications for Treaty Shopping

Article 1 alone is **insufficient** to prevent treaty shopping:
- It only requires residence—not substance
- Courts generally will not "read in" substance requirements
- Must be combined with Article 29 (PPT, LOB) for effective anti-abuse

As the December 2023 exam noted: *"Although it is hard to draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of Art. 1 alone as a means of preventing DTA shopping, Art. 1 is one of the key provisions in the OECD MTC through which the intention expressed in the Preamble to the MTC is put in effect."*

## 7. ARTICLE 1: UN MDTC DIFFERENCES

### 7.1 Comparison

The UN Model follows the OECD structure closely for Article 1:

| Element | OECD MTC | UN MDTC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Paragraph 1** | Identical | Identical |
| **Paragraph 2** | Fiscally transparent entities | Identical (added 2017) |
| **Paragraph 3** | Saving clause | Identical (added 2017) |

### 7.2 Developing Country Considerations

While the text is identical, developing countries often:
- Have more fiscally transparent entities in their economies
- Face greater treaty shopping risks from conduit structures
- May benefit more from robust Article 29 provisions alongside Article 1

---

## 8. EXAM APPLICATION

### 8.1 How Article 1 Appears in Exams

Article 1 typically appears in:
1. **Treaty shopping questions** (December 2023 Q6) - as part of anti-abuse framework
2. **DTC application scenarios** - as first step in analysis
3. **Fiscally transparent entity questions** - Article 1(2) application
4. **Treaty interpretation questions** - who can invoke treaty

### 8.3 Common Exam Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Assuming residence = automatic treaty benefits | Commentary [1]: residence alone does not automatically entitle person to DTA benefits |
| Reading "substance" requirements into Article 1 | Alta: Courts generally will not read in substance requirements |
| Ignoring Article 1(2) for partnerships | Must apply 1(2) to determine if income is treated as resident's income |
| Forgetting saving clause exceptions | Article 1(3) has important exceptions for Articles 7(3), 9(2), 19, 20, 23A/B, 24, 25, 28 |

*This note covers syllabus topic II.F.1: Article 1: Persons Covered (Level 3). Article 1 establishes the personal scope of a DTC, determining who can access treaty benefits. The 2017 amendments added provisions for fiscally transparent entities (paragraph 2) and the saving clause (paragraph 3). Article 1 works with Article 4 (residence) and Article 29 (entitlement to benefits) as part of the gateway framework for treaty access.*
