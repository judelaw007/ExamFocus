# Chapter 6.1: Scope of a DTC – Article 1: Persons Covered

## 1. The Gateway Provision

### 1.1. Purpose and Function

Article 1 is the gateway provision of every double taxation convention. It defines who can access treaty benefits by establishing the personal scope of the convention. Before any substantive treaty provision can apply—whether distributive rules allocating taxing rights, relief methods eliminating double taxation, or procedural mechanisms for dispute resolution—the person seeking benefits must first satisfy Article 1.

The fundamental question Article 1 answers is who is entitled to invoke the provisions of the treaty. This is distinct from the material scope addressed by Article 2 (which taxes are covered) and the substantive entitlement requirements addressed by Article 29 (which residents actually qualify for benefits after anti-abuse tests). Article 1 provides the initial, threshold determination.

### 1.2. Position in DTC Application Sequence

When applying a double taxation convention to a concrete scenario, Article 1 operates as the first filter. The analysis proceeds through a sequence of preliminary determinations before reaching substantive provisions.

The first step asks whether the person is within the personal scope under Article 1. If a person falls outside this scope, the treaty simply does not apply to them, and no further analysis is required. The second step examines whether the tax in question falls within the material scope under Article 2. The third step determines in which State the person is resident under Article 4, which is essential for identifying residence and source States. The fourth step, introduced by the 2017 update, applies the entitlement to benefits tests under Article 29 to determine whether the resident actually qualifies for treaty benefits despite anti-abuse provisions. Only after passing these preliminary filters do the distributive rules (Articles 6-22) and relief methods (Articles 23A/23B) come into play.

This sequential structure reflects the treaty's architecture: personal scope establishes who can potentially claim benefits; residence determines the jurisdictional relationship; entitlement provisions determine who actually receives benefits; and distributive rules allocate those benefits.

## 2. Article 1 Text and Structure

### 2.1. Article 1(1): Personal Scope

Article 1(1) of the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 provides: "This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States."

This deceptively simple formulation contains two key concepts requiring further definition. The term "persons" is defined in Article 3(1)(a) as comprising an individual, a company, and any other body of persons. The term "company" is further defined in Article 3(1)(b) as any body corporate or any entity treated as a body corporate for tax purposes. The broad "any other body of persons" language accommodates diverse legal entities across different jurisdictions.

The term "resident" is not defined in Article 1 itself but in Article 4. Under Article 4(1), a person is resident in a Contracting State if they are liable to tax therein by reason of domicile, residence, place of management, or any other criterion of a similar nature. Critically, Article 4 excludes persons liable to tax only on income from sources within that State—the residence requirement demands a connection that creates potential liability on worldwide income, not merely source-basis taxation.

The phrase "one or both of the Contracting States" recognises that while most treaty provisions assume residence in one State and source in the other, some provisions (notably Article 24 on non-discrimination) may apply to residents of both States.

### 2.2. Article 1(2): Fiscally Transparent Entities

Article 1(2), added in the 2017 update, provides: "For the purposes of this Convention, income derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income of a resident of that State."

This provision codifies principles developed in the 1999 OECD Partnership Report and addresses a significant practical problem: characterisation conflicts involving fiscally transparent entities.

A fiscally transparent entity is one where income is not taxed at the entity level but instead flows through to be taxed in the hands of members or participants. Common examples include partnerships, limited liability partnerships, certain trusts, limited liability companies electing disregarded status, and various domestic equivalents such as the French société en nom collectif or German offene Handelsgesellschaft.

The problem arises because different jurisdictions may characterise the same entity differently. State A might treat an entity as transparent, taxing its members directly, while State B treats the same entity as opaque, taxing the entity itself. Without clear rules, such mismatches could result in either double taxation (where neither jurisdiction provides relief because each views a different taxpayer as the relevant person) or double non-taxation (where each jurisdiction assumes the other is taxing the income).

Article 1(2) resolves this by looking to whether the residence State actually treats the income as that of a resident for tax purposes. If a partnership's income flows through to partners resident in State A, and State A taxes those partners on that income, then those partners can claim treaty benefits on that income. The provision ensures that treaty benefits attach to persons who actually bear tax liability.

### 2.3. Article 1(3): The Saving Clause

Article 1(3), also added in 2017, provides: "This Convention shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents except with respect to the benefits granted under paragraph 3 of Article 7, paragraph 2 of Article 9 and Articles 19, 20, 23 [A] [B], 24, 25 and 28."

The saving clause preserves each Contracting State's right to tax its own residents without limitation from the treaty. It reflects a fundamental principle: double taxation conventions primarily operate to limit source State taxation, not residence State taxation. The residence State retains sovereignty over its own residents' worldwide income, subject only to specific exceptions.

This principle makes conceptual sense. The core problem DTCs address is competing claims by residence and source States over the same income. The residence State claims based on personal connection; the source State claims based on territorial connection. DTCs resolve this conflict by allocating taxing rights and requiring relief. But when the residence State taxes its own resident on foreign-source income, there is no conflict with another State's residence-based claim—only with any source-based claim, which the treaty addresses through the distributive rules and relief articles.

The exceptions listed in Article 1(3) are provisions that would be rendered meaningless if the residence State could simply override them. Article 7(3) concerns deduction of expenses attributable to a permanent establishment. Article 9(2) requires corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases—if the residence State could ignore this, transfer pricing relief would fail. Articles 19 and 20 address government service and students, providing specific protections that must bind the residence State. Articles 23A and 23B on relief methods would be pointless if the residence State were not bound. Article 24 on non-discrimination requires reciprocal obligations. Article 25 on mutual agreement procedure requires both States to participate. Article 28 on diplomatic agents reflects customary international law protections.

## 3. The Resident Requirement

### 3.1. Relationship with Article 4

Article 1 establishes that the treaty applies to residents; Article 4 defines what residence means. The relationship is sequential and definitional: Article 1 creates the requirement, and Article 4 provides the content.

Under Article 4(1), the key criterion is being "liable to tax" by reason of connecting factors such as domicile, residence, or place of management. This creates two elements: a legal susceptibility to taxation (liable to tax) and a personal connection justifying that susceptibility (the connecting factor).

For individuals, Article 4(2) provides tie-breaker rules where a person is resident in both Contracting States: permanent home, centre of vital interests, habitual abode, nationality, and ultimately competent authority determination. For entities, Article 4(3) was modified in 2017 to replace the automatic "place of effective management" tie-breaker with competent authority determination, reflecting recognition that dual-resident entities often involve artificial arrangements.

### 3.2. The "Liable to Tax" Standard

The meaning of "liable to tax" has generated significant controversy. The core question is whether actual payment of tax is required, or whether potential liability suffices.

The prevailing interpretation, confirmed by the Commentary and case law, is that potential or theoretical liability is sufficient. A person need not actually pay tax in a jurisdiction to be "liable to tax" there. The requirement is satisfied if the person is within the scope of the taxing jurisdiction based on personal connection, even if no tax is ultimately due because of exemptions, losses, or other provisions.

The Canadian Supreme Court in Alta Energy Luxembourg (2021) endorsed this interpretation. The majority held that residence need only create "potential" for comprehensive liability—the actual level or amount of tax is irrelevant. A Luxembourg company with minimal economic activity but formal incorporation and management in Luxembourg satisfied the residence requirement because Luxembourg law subjected it to potential worldwide taxation.

Similarly, the Delhi ITAT in General Motors Company USA v. ACIT (2024) held that a US LLC electing disregarded entity status was "liable to tax" in the United States because its income was taxed through its owner. The indirect taxation through the owner satisfied the "liable to tax" requirement because the income was subject to US taxation, albeit in the hands of a different legal person.

This interpretation is consistent with the treaty's purpose of addressing double taxation. Double taxation arises when two jurisdictions each claim taxing rights over the same income. If a person is within the scope of a jurisdiction's taxing power—even if that power is not exercised in a particular case—there is potential for double taxation that the treaty should address.

## 4. Fiscally Transparent Entities in Detail

### 4.1. Background and Policy Rationale

Prior to the 2017 update, DTCs were largely silent on fiscally transparent entities. The 1999 OECD Partnership Report provided interpretive guidance, but its non-binding status created uncertainty and inconsistent application.

The policy rationale for Article 1(2) rests on the principle that treaty benefits should attach to persons who actually bear tax on income. If an entity is transparent, its members bear the tax, and those members should be entitled to treaty protection. Conversely, if neither the entity nor any members are actually taxed on income, treaty benefits should not apply—the treaty's purpose of relieving double taxation has no application where there is no taxation to relieve.

This approach prevents both over-relief (granting benefits to entities that face no taxation) and under-relief (denying benefits to members who do face taxation on transparent entity income). It aligns the treaty entitlement with economic reality.

### 4.2. Characterisation Conflicts

Characterisation conflicts arise in two principal patterns.

In the first pattern, the entity is transparent in the source State but opaque in the residence State. The source State sees income as belonging to members and looks for member-level treaty entitlement. The residence State sees income as belonging to the entity and taxes only the entity. Unless carefully addressed, neither the entity nor the members may obtain treaty relief, because each State's analysis looks to a different taxpayer.

In the second pattern, the entity is opaque in the source State but transparent in the residence State. The source State taxes the entity and may apply withholding taxes accordingly. The residence State taxes the members on the transparent entity's income. Both the entity and members may seek treaty relief, creating potential for excess relief or confusion about which person is entitled to benefits.

Article 1(2) addresses these conflicts by focusing on the residence State's characterisation for determining treaty entitlement. Income through a transparent entity is "income of a resident" only to the extent the residence State actually treats it as such for taxation purposes. This creates a consistent rule: follow the residence State's characterisation to determine who can claim treaty benefits.

### 4.3. Recent Developments

The General Motors Company USA v. ACIT decision (2024) represents a significant recent application of transparent entity principles. The Delhi ITAT held that a US LLC electing disregarded entity treatment qualified for India-US treaty benefits. Although the LLC itself was not directly taxed in the United States, its income was taxed through its parent company, satisfying both the "person" requirement and the "liable to tax" standard.

The decision illustrates how Article 1(2) principles operate even in treaties predating the 2017 update, where courts apply the underlying rationale from the 1999 Partnership Report and subsequent Commentary developments.

India has made reservations regarding MLI Article 3 (which embodies similar principles to Article 1(2)), preferring a treaty-by-treaty approach. This creates ongoing uncertainty regarding transparent entity treatment in India's treaty network.

## 5. The Saving Clause

### 5.1. Purpose and Effect

The saving clause in Article 1(3) ensures that a Contracting State retains full authority to tax its own residents on their worldwide income, regardless of treaty provisions that might otherwise limit such taxation.

Without the saving clause, a residence State might face arguments that treaty provisions limit its taxation of its own residents. For example, a resident of State A with a permanent establishment in State B might argue that Article 7's allocation of PE profits to State B limits State A's ability to tax those profits. The saving clause prevents such arguments by confirming that State A can tax its residents' worldwide income, with relief provided under Articles 23A or 23B.

### 5.2. Exceptions to the Saving Clause

The listed exceptions in Article 1(3) identify provisions that must bind the residence State to function as intended.

Article 7(3) on PE expense deduction would be ineffective if the residence State could disallow such deductions for its own residents. Article 9(2) on corresponding adjustments addresses transfer pricing and requires both States to act—if the residence State could ignore it, double taxation from primary adjustments would persist. Article 19 on government service provides that only the employing State can tax such income, which must bind the residence State when it is not the employing State. Article 20 protects students from residence State taxation on educational payments. Articles 23A and 23B require the residence State to provide relief—these articles would be meaningless without binding the residence State. Article 24 on non-discrimination creates reciprocal obligations that must bind both States. Article 25 on MAP requires competent authority engagement. Article 28 reflects diplomatic immunity principles under customary international law.

### 5.3. The US Approach

The United States employs a broader saving clause than the OECD Model standard. The US model and actual treaties typically reserve the right to tax not only residents but also citizens, wherever resident, and sometimes former citizens and long-term residents for a period following expatriation.

This reflects the US policy of worldwide taxation based on citizenship—a position shared by few other countries. The US saving clause effectively means that US citizens living abroad cannot use treaty provisions to reduce US taxation on most categories of income. Treaty benefits in US treaties primarily serve non-US persons deriving US-source income.

Exceptions to the US saving clause typically include provisions on government service, students, teachers and researchers, social security benefits, and certain pension provisions. These narrow exceptions allow some treaty benefits to flow to US citizens abroad.

## 6. Article 1 and Treaty Abuse

### 6.1. Limits of Personal Scope as Anti-Abuse Tool

Article 1 establishes only that a treaty applies to residents; it does not independently determine whether those residents are entitled to claim specific benefits. This distinction is critical for understanding Article 1's role in the anti-abuse framework.

A person may satisfy Article 1 (being a resident) without necessarily being entitled to treaty benefits. The original treaty framework assumed that all residents would claim benefits, but treaty shopping—the interposition of resident entities to access favourable treaties—created pressure for additional filters. The 2017 update addressed this by introducing Article 29 on entitlement to benefits, which contains the Limitation on Benefits provisions and the Principal Purpose Test.

### 6.2. Alta Energy Luxembourg: No Substance Requirement

The Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L. (2021) is the leading authority on Article 1's scope in relation to treaty shopping.

Alta Energy, a US company, incorporated a Luxembourg holding company (Alta Luxembourg) to acquire shares in a Canadian subsidiary. When Alta Luxembourg sold the Canadian shares to Chevron, realising a gain exceeding CAD 380 million, it claimed exemption from Canadian capital gains tax under the Canada-Luxembourg treaty.

The Canadian tax authority invoked the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR), arguing that using a Luxembourg entity with no substantial economic presence in Luxembourg to access treaty benefits was an abuse of the treaty's object and purpose.

The majority (6-3) held that the GAAR did not apply. On Articles 1 and 4 specifically, the Court found that the object, spirit, and purpose of these provisions is to allow all persons who are residents under the laws of a Contracting State to claim benefits if their residence status could expose them to full tax liability in that State. The Court refused to read an implicit "substance" requirement into these provisions. Luxembourg's domestic law subjected companies to tax based on legal seat or central management, consistent with international norms. Alta Luxembourg satisfied these requirements.

The minority argued that the treaty's object was to assign taxing rights to the State with the closest economic connection, and that Alta Luxembourg—a conduit interposed for residents of third States—had no genuine economic connection with Luxembourg. This view would have read substance requirements into the residence analysis.

The majority's approach reflects strict textual interpretation: if the treaty parties intended substance requirements, they should have included them expressly (as later treaties do through Article 29). Courts should not invent limitations not found in the text.

### 6.3. Relationship with Article 29

The Alta Energy decision underscores that Article 1 alone is insufficient to prevent treaty shopping. The residence requirement is necessary but not sufficient for treaty entitlement.

Article 29, introduced in the 2017 update, provides the substantive anti-abuse filters. The Principal Purpose Test denies benefits where obtaining the benefit was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement, unless granting the benefit would accord with the treaty's object and purpose. The Limitation on Benefits provisions (where adopted) impose objective tests regarding ownership, income base, and business activities.

The Commentary acknowledges this complementary relationship. Paragraph 1 of the Commentary on Article 1 notes that mere residence does not automatically entitle a person to treaty benefits—this was cited in the December 2023 examination. Article 1 establishes personal scope; Article 29 filters that scope for actual entitlement.

## 7. UN Model and Developing Country Perspective

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention 2021 follows the OECD Model closely for Article 1. Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 are identical in both Models, reflecting the consensus that personal scope provisions should be uniform.

The differences between the Models emerge in substantive provisions, not scope provisions. The UN Model generally preserves greater source State taxing rights, reflecting developing country priorities. But on the threshold question of who can access treaty benefits, both Models agree: residents of one or both Contracting States, with transparent entity income attributed to residents who bear tax on it, and residence State taxation of own residents preserved except for specific exceptions.

From a developing country perspective, the more significant concern may be the adequacy of anti-abuse provisions. Treaty shopping often involves routing investments through favourable treaty jurisdictions before reaching developing country source States. Robust Article 29 provisions, rather than Article 1 modifications, address this concern. The UN Model's Commentary discusses these issues, and the Platform for Collaboration on Tax provides guidance to developing countries on protecting their treaty networks from abuse.
