## Chapter 22: Work towards a draft UN Framework Tax Convention and Protocols

### 1. Introduction and Historical Context

#### 1.1. Background to International Tax Governance Reform

The initiative for a United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation represents the most significant potential transformation of international tax governance in decades. For over a century, international tax rules have developed primarily through bilateral treaties and standards set by organizations representing developed countries. Developing countries, despite constituting the majority of the world's nations and population, have historically participated in these processes by invitation rather than as equal partners in rule-making.

The OECD has served as the primary standard-setter for international taxation since the mid-twentieth century. While the OECD's Inclusive Framework on BEPS, established in 2016, broadened participation to over 140 jurisdictions, developing countries have consistently expressed concern that meaningful influence over outcomes remains concentrated among traditional OECD members. The two-pillar solution addressing digitalization and minimum taxation, despite inclusive framework participation, has been criticized by some developing countries as reflecting developed country priorities.

These concerns catalyzed calls for a fundamental restructuring of international tax governance—moving from an OECD-centred system where developing countries participate by invitation to a UN-centred system where all countries participate by right with equal standing.

#### 1.2. The FACTI Panel Recommendations

The High Level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda (FACTI Panel) provided intellectual foundation for the framework convention initiative. Established in 2020 by the President of the UN General Assembly and the President of ECOSOC, the Panel examined how financial accountability, transparency, and integrity could support achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The FACTI Panel's February 2021 final report included a recommendation for negotiation of a UN Tax Convention as a key element of reformed global financial governance. The Panel recognized that existing international tax arrangements inadequately addressed developing country revenue needs and that inclusive governance structures were necessary for legitimate global tax cooperation.

The FACTI Panel recommendation drew on longer-standing proposals, including the 2001 Zedillo Report calling for an International Tax Organization and various civil society campaigns for UN-centred tax governance. However, the FACTI Panel's institutional standing and timing—coming amid pandemic-related fiscal pressures that heightened developing country revenue concerns—gave the recommendation particular salience.

#### 1.3. The Africa Group Initiative

African countries provided the political leadership that translated conceptual proposals into concrete UN processes. In May 2022, the Economic Commission for Africa Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development called for negotiations toward an international tax convention under UN auspices. This collective African position reflected shared concerns about revenue losses from base erosion, profit shifting, and illicit financial flows.

In November 2022, Nigeria, acting on behalf of the Africa Group, tabled a resolution at the UN General Assembly on "Promotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation at the United Nations." This resolution, adopted by consensus, mandated the UN Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report on international tax cooperation. The resolution marked the formal beginning of the UN process that would lead to the framework convention.

The African leadership role reflected the continent's particular stake in international tax reform. African countries lose significant revenue to profit shifting and illicit financial flows, estimated at tens of billions of dollars annually. Strengthening source country taxation rights and improving enforcement capacity are priorities that the existing OECD-centred system has inadequately addressed from African perspectives.

### 2. The Path to the Framework Convention

#### 2.1. Resolution 77/244 (December 2022)

UN General Assembly Resolution 77/244, adopted in December 2022, established the formal process leading to the framework convention. The resolution requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report analyzing options for strengthening international tax cooperation, including through an international tax convention negotiated at the UN.

The resolution reflected developing country determination to advance the agenda despite resistance from some developed countries. While adopted by consensus—reflecting procedural practice for resolutions establishing study processes—the resolution's passage signaled that the framework convention initiative would proceed regardless of developed country reservations.

The Secretary-General's resulting report, presented in 2023, outlined options ranging from enhanced use of existing mechanisms through the UN Tax Committee to negotiation of a comprehensive multilateral convention. The report provided analytical foundation for subsequent General Assembly deliberations.

#### 2.2. Resolution 78/230 (December 2023)

Resolution 78/230, adopted on 22 December 2023, marked the decisive step toward a framework convention. The resolution established an Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Committee mandated to develop draft terms of reference for a UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, with work to be finalized by August 2024.

Unlike Resolution 77/244, Resolution 78/230 was adopted by vote rather than consensus, reflecting the contentious nature of the decision. The vote was 125 in favour, 48 against, and 9 abstentions. Support came overwhelmingly from developing countries, while opposition concentrated among OECD members. The United States, United Kingdom, and most European Union member states voted against the resolution.

The voting pattern illuminated the fundamental tension underlying the initiative: developing countries sought to establish a UN-centred system providing formal equality, while developed countries preferred to maintain the OECD-centred system in which they held greater influence. The resolution's adoption over developed country opposition demonstrated that developing country numerical majority could prevail on procedural votes establishing negotiating processes.

#### 2.3. The Ad Hoc Committee Process (2024)

The Ad Hoc Committee convened in 2024 to draft terms of reference for the framework convention. The organizational session occurred in New York from 20-22 February 2024, followed by the first substantive session from 26 April to 8 May 2024.

A zero draft of the terms of reference, released in June 2024, attracted over 100 stakeholder submissions reflecting diverse perspectives. Developed countries generally preferred broad, high-level, non-prescriptive language providing flexibility, while developing countries preferred detailed, specific guidance to ensure the negotiating committee addressed their priority concerns.

The second substantive session, from 29 July to 16 August 2024, produced the final terms of reference. On 16 August 2024, the Ad Hoc Committee voted to approve the terms of reference, with 110 member states in favour, 44 abstentions (including EU member states), and 8 votes against (including the United States).

### 3. Terms of Reference

#### 3.1. Adoption and Voting Patterns

The UN General Assembly formally adopted the terms of reference through Resolution 79/235 in November 2024. The vote—125 in favour, 9 against, 46 abstentions—demonstrated continued developing country support while revealing developed country reluctance to legitimize the process through affirmative votes.

Countries voting against included the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Argentina, and New Zealand. The European Union and its member states abstained, a position reflecting internal divisions between support for multilateral tax cooperation and concerns about the specific process established. The abstention represented a middle path—neither endorsing the process nor actively opposing it.

The voting patterns reflected broader debates about international institutional reform. Developing countries viewed the process as correcting historical imbalances in global tax governance. Developed countries expressed concerns about duplicating work underway in the OECD Inclusive Framework and about the implications of creating a parallel system with different membership and decision-making rules.

#### 3.2. Objectives and Principles

The terms of reference establish that the framework convention should create an inclusive, fair, transparent, efficient, equitable, and effective international tax system supporting sustainable development. These objectives go beyond technical tax coordination to encompass broader development goals—reflecting the developing country perspective that international tax rules should serve development objectives, not merely facilitate commerce.

Key principles include sovereign equality of states, common but differentiated responsibilities, and progressive realization of commitments based on national circumstances. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, borrowed from environmental law, acknowledges that countries at different development levels may have different obligations and implementation timelines.

The terms of reference explicitly state that the convention will "establish an international tax system"—language reflecting the Africa Group position that the convention should not be subsidiary to existing OECD-centred processes. This framing positions the framework convention as foundational rather than supplementary, potentially reshaping rather than merely complementing existing arrangements.

#### 3.3. Commitments and Scope

The terms of reference outline commitments the framework convention should include: equitable taxation of multinational enterprises, addressing tax evasion and avoidance by high-net-worth individuals, preventing harmful tax practices, strengthening capacity building, and improving information exchange. These commitments address long-standing developing country concerns often inadequately reflected in OECD-centred processes.

The scope encompasses both direct and indirect taxation, though initial focus will be on income taxation. The broad scope contrasts with the OECD's traditional focus on income taxation, leaving open the possibility of addressing VAT/GST, customs duties, and other tax types that significantly affect developing country revenues.

The terms of reference provide for protocols containing substantive tax measures addressing specific issues. Each protocol would be a legally binding instrument under the framework convention, with parties to the convention having the option to join individual protocols. This architecture enables differentiated commitment levels while maintaining a unified framework.

### 4. The Framework Convention Structure

#### 4.1. Structural Elements

The framework convention will include standard structural elements: objectives, principles, institutional provisions, and final clauses. The objectives section will articulate the purposes the convention serves. The principles section will establish interpretive guidance for applying convention provisions. Institutional provisions will create governance mechanisms for ongoing work.

The convention contemplates a Conference of the Parties (COP) to provide ongoing governance, similar to structures in environmental conventions. The COP would oversee protocol development, address implementation questions, and provide a forum for continuing negotiation. This institutional structure would create a permanent UN venue for international tax cooperation, potentially shifting the centre of gravity from OECD processes.

Capacity building provisions will address the resources and technical assistance necessary for developing countries to participate effectively in the system. Unlike the OECD approach where capacity building is provided through separate programs, the framework convention integrates capacity building as a core commitment, recognizing that developing countries cannot implement international tax rules without adequate support.

#### 4.2. Relationship with Existing Frameworks

The relationship between the framework convention and existing international tax arrangements—particularly the OECD Model Tax Convention, the Multilateral Instrument, and the two-pillar solution—remains to be determined through negotiations. Developing countries generally favour an approach where the framework convention establishes overarching principles that guide interpretation and development of other instruments.

Developed countries have expressed concern about potential conflicts between framework convention obligations and existing commitments. The resolution of these concerns will significantly affect developed country willingness to ratify the convention. Negotiators must address how the convention interacts with the approximately 3,000 existing bilateral tax treaties and the MLI modifications affecting many of them.

The terms of reference's statement that the convention will "establish an international tax system" suggests a comprehensive rather than supplementary role. However, the practical relationship with existing instruments will emerge through negotiation and, ultimately, through interpretation and implementation.

#### 4.3. Decision-Making and Governance

The February 2025 organizational session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee established decision-making rules for negotiations. Consensus remains the preferred decision-making approach, but voting procedures exist where consensus cannot be reached. The rules balance inclusiveness with the need for progress.

Governance of the completed framework convention will involve a Conference of the Parties meeting regularly to oversee implementation, develop additional protocols, and address emerging issues. The COP structure, modelled on environmental convention practice, provides flexibility for the convention to evolve as international tax challenges change.

The governance structure represents a significant innovation in international tax cooperation. Unlike the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs, where membership is limited, the framework convention COP would include all parties with equal standing. This universality addresses the inclusion concerns that motivated the framework convention initiative.

### 5. The Early Protocols

#### 5.1. Protocol on Taxation of Cross-Border Services

The first early protocol addresses taxation of income from cross-border services in an increasingly digitalized and globalized economy. This topic directly addresses developing country concerns that current rules inadequately capture value created through digital service provision in their jurisdictions.

The protocol will build on Article 12A of the UN Model Double Taxation Convention, which permits source taxation of fees for technical services. It may also draw on the Article 12B provisions addressing automated digital services introduced in the 2021 UN Model update. The protocol offers an alternative to the OECD's Amount A approach under Pillar One, which has faced implementation delays and developing country criticism.

Cross-border services taxation is particularly significant for developing countries because it addresses a primary mechanism through which value is extracted from their economies without adequate local taxation. Professional services, technical consulting, and digital services often generate substantial income from developing country clients while the income is taxed primarily in residence countries.

#### 5.2. Protocol on Tax Dispute Prevention and Resolution

The second early protocol, selected during the February 2025 organizational session, addresses prevention and resolution of tax disputes. Effective dispute resolution mechanisms are essential for a functioning international tax system, and current mechanisms often disadvantage developing countries lacking resources for prolonged dispute processes.

The protocol may establish enhanced mutual agreement procedure requirements, mandatory binding arbitration provisions, or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Developing countries have historically been reluctant to accept binding arbitration, fearing that arbitrators drawn from developed country legal traditions may favour capital-exporting perspectives. The protocol negotiations must address these concerns while creating effective resolution mechanisms.

Dispute prevention—through clearer rules, advance pricing agreements, and country-by-country reporting—may receive equal attention to dispute resolution. Prevention reduces the burden of disputes, which is particularly significant for developing country tax administrations with limited capacity for extended dispute proceedings.

#### 5.3. Future Protocol Topics

The terms of reference contemplate additional protocols beyond the initial two. Potential topics include taxation of the extractive industries, environmental taxation, wealth taxation, and addressing illicit financial flows. Each protocol would be negotiated separately, allowing the framework convention system to address specific issues as priorities emerge and consensus develops.

The protocol architecture provides flexibility for the framework convention to evolve. Countries can join protocols addressing their priority concerns without necessarily joining all protocols. This differentiated approach may facilitate broader participation by allowing countries to opt into specific commitments rather than accepting comprehensive obligations.

### 6. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee

#### 6.1. Establishment and Mandate

Resolution 79/235 established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) to draft the framework convention and two early protocols. The INC is open to all UN member states, reflecting the inclusive governance philosophy underlying the initiative. Observer participation by international organizations, civil society, and other stakeholders follows established UN practice.

The INC's mandate encompasses drafting the complete text of the framework convention and both protocols for submission to the General Assembly. This comprehensive mandate means the INC must address both the convention's structural provisions and the substantive content of the initial protocols simultaneously.

#### 6.2. Timeline and Sessions (2025-2027)

The terms of reference call for at least three substantive sessions annually from 2025 through 2027. Each session may last up to 10 working days, providing substantial negotiating time. The first substantive sessions occurred in 2025 at UN Headquarters in New York and the UN Office in Nairobi.

Final texts are to be ready for submission during the first quarter of the General Assembly's 82nd session, meaning completion by autumn 2027. The General Assembly would then vote on adoption, with a two-thirds majority required for adoption of the convention text. Following adoption, the convention would be open for signature and ratification by member states.

The ambitious timeline reflects developing country urgency to establish the new framework while momentum exists. However, the complexity of negotiating both a framework convention and two protocols simultaneously may create pressures for extension or simplified initial texts with subsequent elaboration.

#### 6.3. Key Country Positions

The United States announced in February 2025 that it "intends to reject the outcomes of this Framework Convention process and oppose them." This withdrawal significantly affects the convention's potential impact, as the United States is the world's largest economy and a major player in international tax matters. However, the convention can proceed without US participation, and US isolation may carry diplomatic costs.

The European Union has maintained an ambivalent position, abstaining rather than voting against key resolutions. EU member states support multilateral tax cooperation but have concerns about the specific process and potential conflicts with existing commitments. The EU position may evolve as negotiations proceed and the convention's relationship with existing frameworks becomes clearer.

Developing countries, particularly the Africa Group, G77, and China, remain strongly committed to the process. For these countries, the framework convention represents an historic opportunity to reshape international tax governance in ways that better serve their interests and development needs.

### 7. Implications and Future Developments

#### 7.1. Relationship with OECD Processes

The framework convention creates potential for competing international tax governance systems. The OECD Inclusive Framework continues work on the two-pillar solution and other initiatives, while the UN process develops parallel structures. Whether these systems will complement, compete, or eventually merge remains uncertain.

Some observers anticipate that the systems will coexist, with countries choosing participation based on their interests. Others expect eventual convergence, with the more successful system absorbing functions from the less successful. The outcome will depend significantly on which system produces more effective results for participating countries.

The relationship between systems affects the convention's practical significance. If major economies decline participation, the convention's impact on global tax flows may be limited. However, a convention among developing countries could still significantly affect taxation of economic activity within those countries.

#### 7.2. Implications for Developing Countries

For developing countries, the framework convention represents potential transformation of their position in international tax governance. Moving from invited participants in OECD processes to equal members of a UN system addresses long-standing legitimacy concerns. The practical impact depends on whether the convention produces rules more favourable to source country taxation than current arrangements.

The early protocols address specific developing country priorities. Enhanced ability to tax cross-border services and more effective dispute resolution mechanisms could generate significant additional revenue. Capacity building provisions may help developing countries implement international tax rules more effectively.

However, the convention's benefits depend on participation by countries from which developing countries seek to collect tax. If major capital-exporting countries decline participation, the convention may not achieve its revenue objectives regardless of the rules it establishes.

#### 7.3. Challenges and Prospects

The framework convention initiative faces significant challenges. Developed country reluctance may limit participation and effectiveness. The complexity of negotiating comprehensive instruments within the two-year timeline may produce incomplete or ambiguous texts. Tensions between countries with different priorities may impede consensus on contentious issues.

Despite these challenges, the initiative has already achieved significant milestones. The General Assembly has established a formal negotiating process, adopted terms of reference, and begun substantive negotiations. Even if the resulting convention attracts limited initial participation, it establishes a framework that may gain adherents over time as countries assess its benefits.

The framework convention represents a fundamental test of whether international tax governance can be restructured to reflect the interests of all countries rather than primarily those of the historically dominant developed economies. The outcome will significantly shape international tax cooperation for decades to come.
