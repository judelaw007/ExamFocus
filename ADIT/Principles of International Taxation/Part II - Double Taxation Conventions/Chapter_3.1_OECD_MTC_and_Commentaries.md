# Chapter 3.1: The OECD Model Tax Convention and the Commentaries

## 1. The OECD Model Tax Convention as International Benchmark

### 1.1. Origin and Development

The OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital represents the primary international reference framework for the negotiation, interpretation and application of bilateral tax treaties. Since its first publication in 1963, it has served as the authoritative template that states use when concluding double taxation conventions.

The Model's origins trace to the OEEC Fiscal Committee, which began work on draft conventions in 1956. The first OECD Draft Double Taxation Convention appeared in 1963, establishing the foundational structure that persists today. Major revisions followed in 1977, introducing expanded Commentary, and in 1992, reflecting significant economic changes. The 2000 update addressed e-commerce developments and deleted Article 14 on independent personal services. Following the BEPS Project (2013-2015), the 2017 version incorporated substantial changes addressing treaty abuse and base erosion concerns. Today, the OECD MTC forms the basis of over 3,500 bilateral tax treaties globally and is used by OECD and non-OECD countries alike.

### 1.2. Nature and Legal Status

The OECD MTC is not a treaty itself—it is a model or template. This distinction is fundamental for understanding its role in international taxation. As a model, it represents soft law: it possesses no direct legal force and creates no binding obligations on states. Its influence operates through adoption in actual bilateral treaties, which constitute hard law creating enforceable rights and obligations.

This soft law character means that the OECD MTC and its Commentaries possess persuasive authority rather than legal force. Courts may consider the Model and Commentary when interpreting bilateral treaties, but they are not legally obligated to follow them. The contrast with actual DTCs is significant: bilateral treaties, once incorporated into domestic law, are binding and enforceable, while the Model merely provides a recommended framework.

The practical significance of this distinction was extensively examined when past examinations tested the interplay between soft law instruments and binding treaty obligations. Understanding that the OECD MTC operates in a different legal sphere from actual treaties is essential for appreciating its interpretive role.

## 2. The Committee on Fiscal Affairs

### 2.1. Role and Functions

The Committee on Fiscal Affairs (CFA) is the OECD body responsible for developing, maintaining, and updating the OECD MTC and its Commentaries. Working primarily through Working Party 1 on Tax Conventions, the CFA performs several essential functions.

The CFA oversees the periodic development and review of the Model to reflect changes in international tax practices, court decisions, and economic developments. It conducts stakeholder consultation through public consultations with tax authorities, businesses, and professional organisations. Following the BEPS Project, the CFA integrated BEPS recommendations into the Model and Commentary. The Committee also coordinates capacity building, providing training and technical assistance to non-member countries.

The CFA's work is supported by OECD Council Recommendations that guide member states. The 1997 Recommendation provides that member countries should conform to the OECD MTC when concluding or revising bilateral conventions and should interpret provisions in accordance with the Commentaries. This "comply or explain" approach encourages consistency while preserving flexibility for states to deviate where circumstances warrant.

### 2.2. The Relationship Between Model and Commentary

The CFA produces both the Model articles and the accompanying Commentaries. The Commentaries provide essential guidance for treaty application, including explanation of Article provisions and their rationale, guidance on practical application, examples and illustrations for ambiguous terms, alternative provisions, and documentation of changes across different versions.

The CFA invites OECD member governments to notify it of their reservations on the Articles and observations on the Commentaries. This process ensures that the Model reflects consensus where possible while documenting areas of continuing disagreement among member states. Non-member countries may also communicate their positions on both the Model and Commentary.

## 3. Format and Structure of the OECD MTC

### 3.1. The Seven Chapters

The OECD MTC 2017 contains 32 Articles systematically organised into seven chapters, each addressing distinct aspects of international taxation.

Chapter I (Scope of the Convention) comprises Articles 1-2, defining who benefits from the treaty (persons who are residents of one or both contracting states) and listing the types of taxes covered (typically income and capital taxes).

Chapter II (Definitions) encompasses Articles 3-5, providing uniform definitions ensuring clarity and consistency. Article 3 addresses general terms such as "person," "company," "enterprise," and "international traffic." Article 4 establishes the residency definition crucial for treaty benefits. Article 5 defines permanent establishment, central to allocating taxing rights for business activities.

Chapter III (Taxation of Income) contains Articles 6-21, allocating taxing rights between contracting states for various income types. The distributive rules determine which state may tax specific income categories including income from immovable property (Article 6), business profits (Article 7), dividends (Article 10), interest (Article 11), royalties (Article 12), capital gains (Article 13), and employment income (Article 15).

Chapter IV (Taxation of Capital) consists of Article 22, allocating taxing rights over capital, though this provision is less commonly included in actual treaties.

Chapter V (Methods for Elimination of Double Taxation) offers Article 23A (exemption method) and Article 23B (credit method), representing the core mechanisms for preventing juridical double taxation.

Chapter VI (Special Provisions) contains Articles 24-29, addressing specific situations supporting proper treaty application. These include non-discrimination (Article 24), the Mutual Agreement Procedure (Article 25), exchange of information (Article 26), and following the BEPS Project, entitlement to benefits provisions (Article 29).

Chapter VII (Final Provisions) includes Articles 30-32 covering implementation procedures for entry into force and termination.

### 3.2. Key Features of the 2017 Update

The 2017 version incorporated the most significant changes since 1963, implementing outcomes from the BEPS Project. The Preamble was revised to clarify that treaties prevent tax evasion and avoidance—not just double taxation. New paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 1 address transparent entities and include a saving clause. Article 5 narrowed the preparatory and auxiliary exemption and introduced new agency permanent establishment rules. Article 29 introduced anti-abuse provisions including the Principal Purpose Test and optional Limitation on Benefits clause. Article 25 received enhanced Mutual Agreement Procedure provisions.

### 3.3. The 2025 Update

On 18 November 2025, the OECD Council approved the 2025 Update to the Model Tax Convention, reflecting the latest developments in international taxation. The update addresses several significant areas.

The Commentary to Article 5 was revised to provide clarification on remote working arrangements, addressing when an employee's home or another location unconnected to the employer in a different country could create a fixed place of business permanent establishment. This reflects the significant growth in cross-border remote working since the 2017 update. An optional standard provision on activities connected with the exploration and exploitation of extractable natural resources was also introduced, enlarging source state taxing rights through a lower PE threshold.

A new paragraph 6 was added to Article 25 dealing with the interaction between tax treaties and the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services. The Commentary on Article 9 was updated to clarify the application of the arm's length principle in relation to domestic interest deductibility rules. The update also includes changes to the reservations and observations of OECD member countries and the positions of non-members.

## 4. The Commentaries to the OECD MTC

### 4.1. Nature and Purpose

The Commentaries accompany each Article of the OECD MTC and provide authoritative guidance for treaty application. They explain Article provisions and their rationale, offer guidance on practical application, provide examples and illustrations for ambiguous terms, present alternative provisions, give background and historical context, and document changes across different versions.

It is critical to understand that the Commentaries are not part of the treaty text itself. They serve as an interpretive guide but do not constitute binding legal obligations. This distinction has significant implications for how courts may use them when interpreting actual bilateral treaties.

### 4.2. Structure and Content

Each Article's Commentary follows a consistent structure. It provides article-by-article explanation covering rationale, scope, and practical implementation. It offers historical context explaining purpose and evolution, with documentation of changes across updates. Examples and illustrations demonstrate practical application scenarios and clarify ambiguous terms. Cross-references link to related provisions, the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and relevant case law citations. Member country reservations and observations record departures from the consensus position.

### 4.3. Legal Status: The Soft Law Question

The Commentaries possess the same soft law character as the Model itself—they are not legally binding. The Introduction to the OECD MTC acknowledges at paragraph 29 that the Commentaries are not a legally binding document. As stated in the UK case Commerzbank, "subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."

This soft law status creates complexity in treaty interpretation. The Commentaries are highly valued in practice as interpretive tools, yet courts are not obligated to follow them. Different jurisdictions accord them different weight, and the question of which version of the Commentary applies to a particular treaty remains contested. The distinction between soft law instruments (OECD MTC, Commentaries, BEPS Final Reports, Transfer Pricing Guidelines) and hard law instruments (actual DTCs, MLI, domestic implementing legislation) was directly examined in past examinations addressing interpretation complexity.

## 5. The Commentaries in Treaty Interpretation

### 5.1. The Vienna Convention Framework

Tax treaties, as international agreements, are interpreted according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 31 establishes the general rule that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Context includes the text, preamble, annexes, and related agreements. Article 31(3) directs consideration of subsequent agreements, subsequent practice, and relevant rules of international law.

Article 32 provides for supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty (travaux préparatoires) and the circumstances of its conclusion. Recourse to supplementary means is permitted to confirm meaning reached under Article 31 or to determine meaning when Article 31 interpretation leaves it ambiguous, obscure, or manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

### 5.2. OECD Commentaries Under the VCLT

The question of how the OECD Commentary fits within the VCLT framework is significant and contested. The Commentary does not fit neatly into the VCLT categories. Most authorities classify the Commentaries under Article 32 as supplementary means of interpretation. In Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (Australia, 1990), the High Court approved recourse to the OECD Model and Commentaries under Article 32, observing that these documents "form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements and provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties."

Some argue the Commentaries may qualify under Article 31 as context or as reflecting subsequent agreement or practice among treaty parties. However, this classification is more contentious, as the Commentaries are produced by the OECD CFA rather than by the treaty parties themselves.

The practical consequence is that courts generally treat the Commentaries as persuasive but non-binding guidance. Their weight depends on factors including the cogency of their reasoning, whether the treaty provision follows the Model wording, and whether the relevant country has registered reservations or observations.

### 5.3. The Static Versus Ambulatory Debate

A central controversy concerns which version of the Commentary applies when interpreting a treaty. This static versus ambulatory debate has been a frequent topic of examination questions.

The static approach holds that only the Commentary version existing when the treaty was signed applies. This approach emphasises that the Commentary at signing reflects the parties' shared understanding at the time of treaty negotiation and respects VCLT interpretation principles focusing on the parties' intentions.

The ambulatory approach permits later Commentary versions to inform interpretation. This approach argues that the Commentary clarifies existing meaning rather than changing it and allows treaties to evolve with developments in international tax understanding.

The OECD position, set out in paragraphs 33-37 of the Introduction, essentially advocates for the ambulatory approach. It states that subsequent modifications to the Commentary should normally be followed since they reflect the consensus of OECD member countries as to proper interpretation. However, this is qualified by the important caveat that ambulatory application would not be appropriate where modifications have "changed the conclusions" of the Commentary rather than merely clarified them.

This distinction between clarification and change proves difficult to apply in practice. Who determines whether a Commentary amendment clarifies or changes interpretation? This uncertainty creates genuine complexity for practitioners and courts.

### 5.4. Country Approaches

National courts have adopted divergent approaches to the static/ambulatory question.

Canada adopted a largely static approach in Alta Energy Luxembourg v The Queen (2021). The UK follows an ambulatory approach, with courts in Smallwood stating it would be "unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena" and the Supreme Court in Fowler v HMRC (2020) holding that post-treaty Commentaries should be considered. Germany's Federal Tax Court (BFH) maintains a static approach, as confirmed in its December 2023 decision, though this contradicts the German Ministry of Finance's 2023 decree favouring ambulatory interpretation. Australia takes a mixed approach following Thiel, treating Commentaries as Article 32 supplementary means. The United States generally follows an ambulatory approach but accords precedence to Treasury Technical Explanations over OECD Commentary. The Netherlands applies a case-by-case "limited dynamic interpretation."

This divergence among major jurisdictions means that the same treaty provision may be interpreted differently depending on which country's courts are considering it—creating practical uncertainty for taxpayers and tax authorities alike.

## 6. Key Case Law on OECD Commentary Interpretation

### 6.1. Alta Energy Luxembourg (Canada, 2021)

The Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Canada v Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L. (2021 SCC 49) represents the leading authority on the static approach. Alta Energy, a Luxembourg entity, claimed benefits under the Canada-Luxembourg treaty signed in 1999. The Crown argued that 2003 revisions to the OECD Commentary on Article 1 should apply.

The Court held that "Commentaries on art. 1 of the OECD Model Treaty that postdate the Treaty cannot be relied on to introduce terms that modify the Treaty. Not only would this effectively amend the Treaty in a manner not agreed upon by the parties, but it would also usurp the role of the Governor in Council by allowing for judicial amendment of bilateral treaties."

Critically, the Court noted that Luxembourg had registered an observation disagreeing with the 2003 Commentary changes. Interpreting the treaty with reference to the post-treaty Commentary would overlook this registered observation, demonstrating the practical significance of observations in treaty interpretation.

### 6.2. Indofood v JP Morgan (UK, 2006)

In Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA (2006 EWCA Civ 158), the Court of Appeal addressed the use of OECD Commentary in determining the meaning of "beneficial owner." The Court held that the term has an "international fiscal meaning not derived from the domestic laws of contracting states."

The Court applied the OECD Commentary and the Conduit Company Report to conclude that beneficial ownership requires the recipient to "enjoy the full privilege to directly benefit from the income." This case demonstrates how OECD Commentary informs the autonomous international meaning of treaty terms.

### 6.3. Thiel v FCT (Australia, 1990)

The High Court of Australia in Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) established the foundational authority for treating OECD Commentary as supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT. The Court observed that the OECD Model and Commentaries "form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements and provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties." This classification has been widely followed internationally.

### 6.4. UK Authorities: Commerzbank, Smallwood, Fowler

UK courts have developed significant jurisprudence on OECD Commentary. In Commerzbank, the court established that DTCs should be interpreted based on VCLT Articles 31-32 and that "subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have persuasive value only, depending on the cogency of their reasoning."

The Smallwood decision articulated the UK's ambulatory inclination: "it would be unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena." The UK Supreme Court in Fowler v HMRC (2020) confirmed that OECD Commentaries post-dating a particular treaty should be given consideration in interpretation.

### 6.5. German Federal Tax Court (BFH 2023)

In its decision of 5 December 2023 (published 2 May 2024), the German Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) reinforced the static approach, ruling that a version of the OECD Commentary that did not exist before the treaty came into force cannot be relied upon. This contradicts the official position of the German tax authorities expressed in a 2023 Ministry of Finance decree favouring ambulatory interpretation—creating tension between judicial and administrative approaches within Germany.

## 7. Reservations, Observations and Positions

The mechanisms for departures from the OECD MTC and Commentary—reservations, observations and positions—constitute an important topic that has been directly examined in past papers.

### 7.1. Reservations

Reservations are stated views of OECD member countries regarding provisions of the OECD MTC with which they disagree or wish to modify. They signal a member's intention to deviate from the Model in treaty negotiations. Reservations relate to the Article text itself, not to Commentary interpretations. They are located within the Commentary on the relevant Article and form part of the Commentary.

The 2017 OECD MTC contained 226 reservations, with highest concentrations on Article 5 (29 reservations), Article 10 (22), and Article 13 (20). Articles 26-28 had no reservations.

### 7.2. Observations

Observations are stated views of OECD member countries regarding the Commentary interpretation with which they disagree. Unlike reservations, observations do not express disagreement with the Article text itself. As stated in Introduction paragraph 30, observations "usefully indicate the way in which those countries will apply the provisions of the Article in question."

Observations relate to Commentary interpretations, are made by OECD members only, and are located within and form part of the Commentary. For example, certain countries have observed that they do not share particular interpretations regarding when electronic servers may constitute permanent establishments.

### 7.3. Positions

Positions are stated views of non-OECD members regarding both the OECD MTC provisions and the Commentary. They are made by non-OECD countries (observers, associated countries) and relate to both Model text and Commentary. Positions are located in a separate section at the end of the OECD MTC and importantly do not form part of the Commentary.

This location difference is significant: because positions do not form part of the Commentary, they generally carry lower interpretive weight than reservations and observations made by OECD members. Major developing economies including India, China, and Brazil have registered positions on various articles.

### 7.4. Interpretive Significance

Reservations, observations and positions play a significant role in treaty interpretation. The Alta Energy decision demonstrated this clearly: Luxembourg's observation disagreeing with 2003 Commentary changes proved determinative in limiting the Court's willingness to apply ambulatory interpretation. Courts must consider whether a treaty party has registered departures from the standard interpretation before applying Commentary guidance.

These mechanisms serve the important function of maintaining consensus on core principles while accommodating the diversity of national tax systems and policy preferences. They enable the OECD to develop authoritative guidance while acknowledging that not all members agree with every aspect of that guidance.
