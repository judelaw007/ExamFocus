## A. INTRODUCTION: THE OECD MODEL TAX CONVENTION

### 1. The OECD MTC as International Benchmark

The **OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital** (OECD MTC) is the primary international reference framework for the negotiation, interpretation and application of bilateral tax treaties. Since its first publication in 1963, it has served as the authoritative template that states use when concluding double taxation conventions.

**Key Statistics**:
- Forms the basis of over **3,500 bilateral tax treaties** globally
- Used by OECD and non-OECD countries alike
- Regularly updated to reflect developments in international taxation
- Current version: **OECD MTC 2017** (with subsequent Commentary updates)

### 2. Nature and Legal Status

The OECD MTC is **not a treaty itself**—it is a **model** or template. This distinction is fundamental for exam purposes.

### 3. The OECD Council Recommendations

The CFA's work is supported by **Council Recommendations** that guide member states:

- **1997 Recommendation**: Member countries should conform to the OECD MTC when concluding or revising bilateral conventions
- Countries should interpret provisions in accordance with the Commentaries
- Deviations from the Model should be explained
- "**Comply or explain**" approach encourages consistency while preserving flexibility

## D. THE COMMENTARIES TO THE OECD MTC

### 1. Nature and Purpose

The **Commentaries** accompany each Article of the OECD MTC and provide essential guidance for treaty application:

- Explanation of Article provisions and their rationale
- Guidance on practical application
- Examples and illustrations for ambiguous terms
- Alternative provisions
- Background and historical context
- Documentation of changes across different versions

**Critical Point**: The Commentaries are **not part of the treaty text** itself but serve as an authoritative interpretive guide.

### 2. Structure of the Commentaries

```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Legal Status: Soft Law

**June 2024 Q2** extensively tested the distinction between soft law and hard law in DTA interpretation:

```
LEGAL STATUS OF OECD COMMENTARIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                    HARD LAW                    SOFT LAW
                       │                           │
            ┌──────────┴──────────┐    ┌───────────┴───────────┐
            │                     │    │                       │
       • Actual DTCs          • MLI    │  • OECD MTC           │
       • Domestic law               │  │  • OECD Commentaries  │
                                    │  │  • BEPS Final Reports │
                                    │  │  • TP Guidelines      │
                                    │  └───────────────────────┘
                                    │              │
                                    │              ▼
                                    │    NOT legally binding
                                    │    BUT highly influential
                                    │    "Persuasive authority"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

| Characteristic | Soft Law (Commentaries) | Hard Law (Treaties) |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Binding** | No | Yes |
| **Created by** | OECD CFA | Contracting states |
| **Direct legal effect** | No | Yes |
| **Role in courts** | Interpretive aid | Applicable law |
| **Can create rights** | No | Yes |

### 4. Role in Treaty Interpretation

The Commentaries interact with the **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT)** interpretation framework:

| VCLT Article | Content | Commentaries' Role |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Article 31(1)** | Good faith; ordinary meaning; context; object and purpose | Commentaries may inform object and purpose |
| **Article 31(2)** | Context includes agreements made in connection with treaty | Debated whether Commentaries qualify |
| **Article 31(3)** | Subsequent agreements; subsequent practice | Some argue Commentaries reflect subsequent practice |
| **Article 32** | Supplementary means (preparatory works) | Most common classification for Commentaries |

**Key Debate**: Most authorities place Commentaries under **Article 32 VCLT** as supplementary means of interpretation, though their exact status remains contested.

---

## E. THE STATIC VS AMBULATORY DEBATE

### 1. The Core Question

When a treaty was signed in (e.g.) 2000 but a dispute arises in 2024, which version of the Commentary applies?

```
STATIC VS AMBULATORY APPROACHES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STATIC APPROACH                      AMBULATORY APPROACH
      │                                      │
      ▼                                      ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Only Commentary version │        │ Later Commentary        │
│ existing when treaty    │        │ versions can be used    │
│ was SIGNED applies      │        │ to interpret existing   │
│                         │        │ treaties                │
│ Rationale:              │        │                         │
│ • Reflects parties'     │        │ Rationale:              │
│   intentions at time    │        │ • Commentary clarifies  │
│ • Respects VCLT         │        │   existing meaning      │
│   interpretation rules  │        │ • Reflects evolution    │
│                         │        │   of understanding      │
└─────────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. OECD Position

The **Introduction to the OECD MTC** [33]-[37] addresses this issue:

> "Subsequent modifications to the Commentary should normally be followed when interpreting conventions concluded before such modifications... since such modifications reflect the **consensus of the OECD member countries** as to the proper interpretation of existing provisions."

**BUT** with important qualification:

> "This would not be appropriate where the modifications have **changed the conclusions** of the Commentary, rather than merely clarified them."

### 3. Practical Implications

| Scenario | Appropriate Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Commentary **clarifies** existing meaning | Ambulatory (later version) acceptable |
| Commentary **changes** the interpretation | Static (version at signing) should apply |
| New provision added to Model | Ambulatory approach inappropriate |
| Anti-abuse measures (BEPS) | Complex—depends on treaty wording |

### 4. Country-Specific Approaches

| Country | Approach | Key Authority |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Canada** | Static | *Alta Energy* (2021 SCC 49) |
| **UK** | Ambulatory | *Smallwood*; *Fowler v HMRC* (2020) |
| **Germany** | Static | BFH (5 December 2023) |
| **Australia** | Mixed | *Thiel* (1990) - Article 32 VCLT |
| **USA** | Generally ambulatory | But Treasury TEs take precedence |
| **Netherlands** | Case-by-case | "Limited dynamic interpretation" |
| **Spain** | Static | Supreme Court (2020) - no retroactive application |

---

## F. KEY CASE LAW ON OECD COMMENTARY INTERPRETATION

Understanding leading cases on OECD Commentary use is essential for exam purposes. Examiners expect candidates to support arguments with case law authority.

### 1. Alta Energy Luxembourg v The Queen (Canada, 2021 SCC 49)

**Landmark authority on static vs ambulatory approach**

**Facts**: Alta Energy, a Luxembourg entity, claimed benefits under the Canada-Luxembourg tax treaty (1999). The Crown argued that 2003 revisions to the OECD Commentary on Article 1 should apply.

**Holding**: The Supreme Court of Canada adopted a **largely static approach**:

> "Commentaries on art. 1 of the OECD Model Treaty that postdate the Treaty cannot be relied on to introduce terms that modify the Treaty. Not only would this effectively amend the Treaty in a manner not agreed upon by the parties, but it would also usurp the role of the Governor in Council by allowing for judicial amendment of bilateral treaties."

**Key Principles Established**:
- Revisions subsequent to treaty negotiation "do not reflect the intentions of the drafters"
- Later commentaries may assist **only if** they expand upon or clarify concepts already found in the earlier applicable model
- They cannot "extend the scope of provisions in a manner that could not have been considered by the drafters"
- **Reservations and observations matter**: Luxembourg's observation disagreeing with 2003 Commentary changes was determinative

**Exam Application**: Cite *Alta Energy* when discussing limitations on ambulatory approach; emphasise importance of reservations/observations.

### 2. Indofood v JP Morgan Chase Bank (UK, 2006 EWCA Civ 158)

**International fiscal meaning and OECD Commentary use**

**Facts**: Indonesian group used Mauritius SPV to reduce withholding tax; Indonesia terminated Mauritius DTA.

**Holding**: The Court of Appeal held:
- "Beneficial owner" has **international fiscal meaning** not derived from domestic law
- Applied OECD Commentary and Conduit Company Report
- Test: recipient must "enjoy the full privilege to directly benefit from the income"

**Key Principle**: OECD Commentary informs the **international fiscal meaning** of treaty terms, distinct from domestic law meanings.

**Exam Application**: Cite for proposition that treaty terms may have autonomous international meaning informed by OECD Commentary.

### 3. Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (Australia, 1990)

**OECD Commentary as Article 32 VCLT supplementary means**

**Holding**: The High Court of Australia approved recourse to OECD Model and Commentaries under **Article 32 VCLT**:

> "These documents form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral double taxation agreements and provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties."

**Significance**: Foundational authority for treating OECD Commentary as supplementary means of interpretation under VCLT Article 32.

### 4. Commerzbank AG (UK)

**Persuasive value and VCLT framework**

**Holdings**:
- DTAs should principally be interpreted based on **VCLT Articles 31-32**
- "Subsequent commentaries on a convention or treaty have **persuasive value only**, depending on the cogency of their reasoning"

**Exam Application**: Quote "persuasive value only" when explaining non-binding nature of Commentaries.

### 5. Smallwood and Fowler v HMRC (UK)

**UK ambulatory approach**

**Smallwood**: "It would be **unwise to shut one's eyes** to developments in the international tax arena."

**Fowler v HMRC (2020)**: UK Supreme Court held that OECD Commentaries which post-date a particular double tax treaty **should be given consideration** in interpretation.

**Exam Application**: Cite for UK position favouring ambulatory approach.

### 6. BFH Germany (5 December 2023)

**Reinforcing static approach**

**Holding**: German Federal Tax Court ruled that a version of OECD Commentary that did not exist before the Treaty came into force cannot be relied on.

**Significance**: Contradicts official German tax authority views; clarifies Germany's judicial commitment to static approach.

| **Purpose** | Signal intention to deviate from Model in treaty negotiations |

**OECD MTC 2017 Statistics**:
- 226 reservations total
- Highest concentration: Article 5 (29), Article 10 (22), Article 13 (20)
- No reservations: Articles 26-28

**Example**: A country may reserve the right to include a services PE in its treaties (not in standard OECD MTC Article 5).

### 3. Observations

**Definition**: Stated views of **OECD member countries** regarding the **Commentary** (not the Article text) with which they disagree or cannot concur.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Made by** | OECD members only |
| **Relates to** | Commentary interpretations |
| **Location** | Within Commentary |
| **Purpose** | Indicate differing interpretation of provisions |

**Introduction [30]**: Observations "usefully indicate the way in which those countries will apply the provisions of the Article in question."

**Example**: Portugal observed it does not interpret a server as constituting a PE (contrary to Commentary guidance).

### 4. Positions

**Definition**: Stated views of **non-OECD members** regarding both the OECD MTC provisions AND the Commentary.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Made by** | Non-OECD members (Observers, Associated Countries) |
| **Relates to** | Both MTC provisions and Commentary |
| **Location** | Separate section at end of OECD MTC |
| **Purpose** | Communicate non-OECD country policies |

**Key Difference**: Positions do **not** form part of the Commentary and have more limited interpretive value.

### 5. Comparison Table

## H. BEPS IMPACT ON OECD MTC 2017

### 1. The 2017 Update

The BEPS Project (2013-2015) led to the most significant update to the OECD MTC since 1963:

| BEPS Action | Impact on OECD MTC 2017 |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Action 2** | Article 1(2)-(3) - Hybrid mismatches; transparent entities |
| **Action 6** | Preamble; Article 29 (PPT/LOB); Various anti-abuse provisions |
| **Action 7** | Article 5 - PE definition changes |
| **Action 14** | Article 25 - Enhanced MAP |
| **Various** | 150+ pages of new Commentary |

### 2. Soft Law to Hard Law Pathway

As examined in **June 2024 Q2**, BEPS outputs have followed a transformation pathway:

### 2. Worked Example: December 2023 Q1

**Question**: "With reference to the OECD MTC 2017 and its Commentary, explain the differences between reservations, observations and positions. Discuss their role in treaty interpretation." (25 marks)

```
MODEL ANSWER FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INTRODUCTION (2-3 marks, ~3 minutes)
• OECD MTC serves as template for 3,500+ bilateral treaties
• Not all OECD members agree with every provision/interpretation
• Mechanisms exist for states to signal departures while maintaining
  overall consensus framework
• Three distinct categories: reservations, observations, positions

SECTION 1: RESERVATIONS (6-7 marks, ~10 minutes)
Definition:
• Stated views of OECD member countries regarding MTC PROVISIONS
• Signal intention to deviate from Model in treaty negotiations

Key characteristics:
• Made by OECD members only
• Relate to Article TEXT (not Commentary interpretation)
• Located within Commentary on relevant Article
• Form part of Commentary

Statistics (from OECD MTC 2017):
• 226 total reservations
• Highest: Article 5 (29), Article 10 (22), Article 13 (20)
• None on Articles 26-28

Example: Country reserves right to include services PE (not in
standard Article 5); reserves right to apply different withholding
rate on dividends

SECTION 2: OBSERVATIONS (6-7 marks, ~10 minutes)
Definition:
• Stated views of OECD members on COMMENTARY interpretation
• Do NOT express disagreement with Article text
• Indicate how country will apply provisions differently

Key characteristics:
• Made by OECD members only
• Relate to Commentary interpretations
• Located within Commentary
• Form part of Commentary

Per Introduction [30]:
"Observations usefully indicate the way in which those countries
will apply the provisions of the Article in question"

Example: Portugal observed it does not interpret server as
constituting PE (contrary to e-commerce Commentary guidance)

SECTION 3: POSITIONS (5-6 marks, ~8 minutes)
Definition:
• Stated views of NON-OECD members on BOTH provisions AND Commentary
• Mechanism for non-OECD countries to engage with OECD framework

Key characteristics:
• Made by non-OECD members (Observers, Associated Countries)
• Relate to BOTH MTC text AND Commentary
• Located in SEPARATE section at end of OECD MTC
• Do NOT form part of Commentary

Key difference: Lower interpretive weight than reservations/observations
because positions are not integrated into Commentary

Examples: India, China, Brazil positions on various articles

SECTION 4: ROLE IN INTERPRETATION (4-5 marks, ~7 minutes)
Under VCLT framework:
• Reservations and observations may constitute "context" (Art 31(2))
• Or supplementary means (Art 32)
• Courts must consider them when treaty party has registered one

Alta Energy (Canada, 2021 SCC 49):
• Luxembourg's observation disagreeing with 2003 Commentary was
  determinative
• Court held interpreting Treaty with reference to post-treaty
  Commentary would overlook registered observation
• Demonstrates practical significance of observations

Practical implications:
• Check relevant reservations/observations before applying
  Commentary interpretation
• Treaty partner's registered positions may affect application
• Alta Energy shows courts will give weight to these departures

CONCLUSION (2-3 marks, ~3 minutes)
• Three distinct mechanisms serve different functions
• Reservations = disagreement with Model provisions
• Observations = different interpretation of Commentary
• Positions = non-OECD engagement (lower status)
• All play role in maintaining consensus while accommodating
  diversity
• Critical for practitioners to check before applying standard
  Commentary guidance

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 3. Worked Example: June 2024 Q2 (Soft Law/Hard Law)

**Question**: "The interplay of soft law and hard law in international tax creates complexity in interpreting double tax agreements." Critically evaluate this statement. (25 marks)

```
MODEL ANSWER FRAMEWORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INTRODUCTION (3 marks, ~4 minutes)
• Define soft law: non-binding normative instruments with
  persuasive but not legal force
• Define hard law: legally binding instruments creating
  enforceable rights/obligations
• International tax characterised by interaction between both
• Statement is ACCURATE - creates genuine complexity

SECTION 1: VCLT INTERPRETATION FRAMEWORK (5-6 marks, ~9 minutes)
Article 31 - General Rule:
• Good faith interpretation
• Ordinary meaning
• Context
• Object and purpose

Article 32 - Supplementary Means:
• Travaux préparatoires
• Circumstances of conclusion
• OECD Commentary fits most naturally here (per Thiel, Australia)

Article 31(3)(a)-(c) considerations:
• Subsequent agreements
• Subsequent practice
• Relevant rules of international law

Why complexity arises:
• OECD Commentary doesn't fit neatly into VCLT categories
• Debate whether context (Art 31) or supplementary means (Art 32)
• Different courts reach different conclusions

SECTION 2: SOFT LAW IN INTERNATIONAL TAX (6-7 marks, ~10 minutes)
Key soft law instruments:
• OECD Model Tax Convention (template, not treaty)
• OECD Commentary
• OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
• BEPS Final Reports (2015)
• Various OECD guidance and reports

Characteristics:
• NOT legally binding
• Persuasive authority only (Commerzbank: "persuasive value only,
  depending on the cogency of their reasoning")
• Created by OECD CFA, not treaty partners
• Can be updated without state consent

Role in interpretation:
• Informs "international fiscal meaning" (Indofood)
• Provides consistent framework across jurisdictions
• But creates complexity when courts disagree on weight

SECTION 3: HARD LAW INSTRUMENTS (5-6 marks, ~9 minutes)
Key hard law instruments:
• Bilateral DTCs (binding between parties)
• MLI (2016) - modifies existing treaties
• Domestic legislation incorporating treaties
• EU Directives (where applicable)

Transformation pathway (BEPS example):
• BEPS Final Reports 2015 = soft law
• 2017 OECD MTC Commentary updates = soft law
• MLI = hard law
• Amended bilateral treaties = hard law
• Domestic implementing legislation = hard law

Why this creates complexity:
• Same concepts appear in soft and hard instruments
• Unclear which version governs specific treaty
• Static vs ambulatory debate compounds difficulty

SECTION 4: STATIC VS AMBULATORY COMPLEXITY (4-5 marks, ~7 minutes)
Core problem:
• Treaty signed 2000, dispute arises 2024
• Commentary updated 2003, 2017, ongoing
• Which version applies?

Country approaches diverge:
• Canada (Alta Energy): Static - later Commentary cannot modify
• UK (Smallwood/Fowler): Ambulatory - consider developments
• Germany (BFH 2023): Static
• US: Generally ambulatory but Treasury TEs take precedence

OECD position (Introduction [33]-[37]):
• Ambulatory for clarifications
• Static where Commentary "changed conclusions"
• But who decides if clarification or change?

SECTION 5: CONCLUSION (3 marks, ~4 minutes)
Statement is CORRECT - genuine complexity exists:
• No universal answer to soft law weight
• Static/ambulatory debate unresolved internationally
• Different courts reach different conclusions
• Practitioners must navigate multiple instruments

However, complexity manageable because:
• VCLT provides framework
• Commentary provides consistency where followed
• Courts increasingly engage with issues
• BEPS hardening process clarifies some areas

Balanced conclusion: Complexity is real but structured frameworks
exist; need harmonisation of approach

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4. Key Points for All DTC Questions

When answering **any** question involving DTC provisions:
- Reference the relevant OECD MTC Article
- Note relevant Commentary paragraphs
- Consider whether reservations/observations exist
- Apply VCLT interpretation principles (Articles 31-32)
- Note any BEPS/2017 changes if relevant
- Cite key cases where appropriate (*Alta Energy*, *Thiel*, *Commerzbank*)

### 5. Time Management Guide

## Common Exam Errors to Avoid

| Error | Why It Loses Marks | Correct Approach |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Treating OECD MTC as binding law | Fundamental conceptual error | Emphasise soft law nature |
| Confusing reservations with observations | Different subjects; different makers | Reservations = provisions; Observations = Commentary |
| Ignoring VCLT in interpretation | Missing legal framework | Reference Articles 31-32 VCLT |
| Applying ambulatory approach universally | Oversimplifies complex issue | Distinguish clarifications from changes |
| Missing BEPS impact on 2017 MTC | Dated analysis | Reference 2017 changes and Commentary additions |
| Treating positions same as reservations | Non-OECD positions have different status | Note positions are NOT part of Commentary |
| Confusing format with substance | Missing structural analysis | Explain 7-chapter structure systematically |
