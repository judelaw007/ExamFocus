## Chapter 10.3: Entertainers and Sportspersons – Article 17, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 17

Article 17 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) provides a special rule for taxing income derived by entertainers and sportspersons from their personal performance activities. Unlike the general rules for employment income under Article 15 or business profits under Article 7, Article 17 grants the source state—where the performance takes place—an unqualified right to tax performance income, regardless of whether the performer has a permanent establishment or meets any minimum presence threshold.

This provision addresses a unique category of high-mobility workers whose earning patterns differ fundamentally from ordinary employees or business operators. Entertainers and sportspersons often perform briefly in many countries during a single tour or competition season, generating significant income in each jurisdiction while spending only days or hours in each location. Without a special provision, these performers could escape source taxation entirely by structuring their activities to avoid permanent establishment status and stay below the 183-day threshold.

#### 1.2. Policy Rationale

The rationale for Article 17 rests on practical and policy considerations. Entertainers and sportspersons often earn substantial sums for brief appearances, making traditional nexus requirements inappropriate. A world-famous musician might earn millions from a single concert lasting three hours, yet would not be taxable in the source state under Article 15 if present for less than 183 days, or under Article 7 if lacking a permanent establishment.

The policy response in Article 17 is straightforward: the state where the performance takes place may tax the resulting income, period. No minimum presence is required. No permanent establishment is needed. The connection to the source state—the physical performance before an audience—is considered sufficient nexus to justify taxation. This approach ensures that high-profile performers contribute to the tax base of countries where they earn income, preventing what might otherwise be perceived as an inequitable gap in the international tax system.

However, Article 17 has been criticised for creating compliance burdens for lower-income performers, potentially impeding cultural and sporting exchanges. The OECD has acknowledged these concerns and, in the 2014 Commentary, recommended that states consider exemptions, minimum monetary thresholds, and expense deductions to mitigate the harsh effects of source taxation on performers who do not earn substantial income.

#### 1.3. Historical Context

Article 17 has existed in substantially its current form since the OECD Model was first published in 1963. The provision reflected concerns about mobile performers using their geographic flexibility to avoid taxation. In 1977, the OECD introduced Article 17(2), the "star company" provision, to address arrangements where performers interposed companies or agents between themselves and event organisers to receive performance fees, thereby attempting to route income away from source state taxation.

### 2. The Text of Article 17

#### 2.1. Article 17(1): Direct Income to Performers

Article 17(1) of the OECD MTC 2017 provides: "Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State."

The opening phrase "notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 15" establishes Article 17 as lex specialis—a special rule that takes precedence over the general provisions for business profits and employment income. Where Article 17 applies, it overrides both the permanent establishment requirement of Article 7 and the 183-day exception of Article 15(2).

#### 2.2. Article 17(2): Income Paid to Third Parties

Article 17(2) provides: "Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised."

This provision addresses the "star company" problem: arrangements where performance fees are paid not to the performer but to an interposed entity—an agent, management company, or specially created "artiste company"—to avoid source taxation. Article 17(2) allows the source state to tax the income regardless of who receives the payment, provided it relates to the performer's personal activities in that state.

### 3. Who is Covered by Article 17

#### 3.1. Definition of "Entertainer"

The Commentary on Article 17 acknowledges that it is not possible to give a precise definition of "entertainer." Paragraph 3 of the Commentary provides examples rather than an exhaustive list: theatre performers (actors), motion picture artistes, radio artistes, television artistes, and musicians are expressly mentioned in the article text itself. The Commentary adds that stage performers, circus performers, and variety show participants are also included. *(covered in June 2023)*

The defining characteristic is the entertainment function—performing before an audience or for recording. However, not everyone involved in entertainment falls within Article 17. Administrative and support staff, producers, directors who do not themselves perform, and technical crew members are not entertainers for Article 17 purposes. Their income falls within Articles 7 or 15 as appropriate. The distinction turns on whether the individual personally provides entertainment to an audience.

#### 3.2. Definition of "Sportsperson"

The term "sportsperson" encompasses professional athletes, amateur athletes who receive income, members of sports teams, and—in an emerging area—e-sportspersons who compete in video game competitions. The key requirement is participation in sporting activities, whether individual or team-based, for which the individual receives income.

For e-sportspersons, commentators debate whether they qualify as "sportspersons" or "entertainers" or both. The answer may depend on whether e-sports competitions are characterised as sporting events in the relevant jurisdictions. Regardless of classification, if e-sportspersons provide entertainment through their competitive activities, Article 17 likely applies.

#### 3.3. "Personal Activities as Such"

Article 17 applies to income derived from "personal activities as such." This phrase limits the scope to income directly connected to the performer's entertainment or sporting activities. The performer must personally exercise the activities that generate the income—actual performance or competition is required.

Activities that are not themselves performance but are closely connected to performance may also fall within Article 17. This "closely connected income" concept, discussed in Section 5 below, extends the provision's reach to certain ancillary income streams.

### 4. The Article 17(2) "Star Company" Provision

#### 4.1. The Problem Addressed

Without Article 17(2), a performer could establish a company in a low-tax jurisdiction, contract with the company rather than directly with event organisers, and receive performance fees through the company. The source state would have no taxing right over the company (absent a permanent establishment) and limited ability to tax the performer (who would receive a modest "salary" from the company rather than direct performance fees).

Article 17(2) solves this by allowing the source state to "look through" the arrangement. The income may be taxed where the activities are exercised, regardless of who receives the payment. The company, agent, or other recipient is taxable in the source state on the performance income it receives.

#### 4.2. Scope of Application

Article 17(2) applies when income "accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson himself but to another person." This encompasses payments to agents, managers, management companies, specially created "artiste companies," sports teams (for team sports), and any other third-party recipients. The connecting factor remains the performer's physical activities in the source state—the payment is taxable there because the performer exercised activities there, even though the performer did not directly receive the payment. *(covered in June 2023)*

#### 4.3. Restrictions in Some Treaties

Some countries have reservations regarding Article 17(2). Canada, Switzerland, and the United States have expressed the view that Article 17(2) should apply only in abusive situations—where the performer controls or owns the entity receiving the income. Treaties involving these countries may contain restrictions limiting Article 17(2) to cases where the star company is genuinely a vehicle for tax avoidance rather than a legitimate business arrangement.

### 5. Closely Connected Income

#### 5.1. The Concept

Income that is "closely connected" to a performance may fall within Article 17 even if not paid directly for the performance itself. The Commentary at paragraph 9 provides guidance: a close connection may exist where it cannot reasonably be considered that the income would have been derived in the absence of the performance.

#### 5.2. Examples of Closely Connected Income

Income typically considered closely connected includes appearance fees paid in connection with a performance event, prize money for competition results, sponsorship payments specifically linked to a particular event, endorsement activities conducted at the event venue, interview fees for media appearances during a competition, and television appearances made immediately after a performance. *(covered in June 2023)*

The temporal and causal link to the performance is key. A television interview conducted immediately after winning a championship, in which the athlete discusses the victory while wearing sponsor logos, is closely connected to the sporting activity. The interview income would not have been earned but for the competitive performance.

#### 5.3. Income Not Closely Connected

General sponsorship income that is not event-specific falls outside Article 17. Advertising revenue earned in the performer's residence state, royalties from previous performances, and income from activities unrelated to entertainment or sports are not closely connected to any particular source state performance. Such income falls within other treaty provisions—Article 7 for business profits, Article 12 for royalties—and is taxed according to those articles' allocation rules.

### 6. Interaction with Other Articles

#### 6.1. Article 17 and Article 7 (Business Profits)

Article 17 overrides Article 7's permanent establishment requirement. Under Article 7, business profits are taxable in a source state only if the enterprise has a permanent establishment there. Performers rarely establish permanent establishments in countries where they perform briefly, yet they may earn substantial income. Article 17 ensures source taxation regardless of permanent establishment status.

For performers operating through personal service companies, Article 17(2) permits source taxation of the company's income, again without requiring a permanent establishment. The company's profit from the performance engagement is taxable in the source state because it derives from the performer's activities there.

#### 6.2. Article 17 and Article 15 (Employment Income)

Article 17 also overrides Article 15's conditions for source taxation. Under Article 15(2), employment income may be taxable only in the residence state if the employee is present in the source state for less than 183 days, the employer is not resident there, and the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment there. These conditions are inapplicable to entertainers and sportspersons—Article 17 permits source taxation regardless of the length of presence or the residence of the employer.

This distinction matters because many performers are present in each country for only a few days per engagement. Without Article 17, they could benefit from Article 15(2)'s exception and escape source taxation entirely. Article 17 closes this possibility.

#### 6.3. Article 17 and Article 12 (Royalties)

The boundary between Article 17 and Article 12 arises when performance activities generate both immediate performance income and subsequent broadcasting or reproduction rights. A concert performance generates Article 17 income for the live performance; broadcasting rights to transmit the concert recording may generate Article 12 royalties. Commentary paragraph 9.4 provides guidance on allocating income between these provisions.

The distinction matters because Article 12 and Article 17 may allocate taxing rights differently. Article 12 typically grants exclusive or shared residence state taxation for royalties, while Article 17 grants source state taxation for performance income. Proper characterisation of each income stream is necessary to apply the correct treaty provision.

### 7. UN Model Considerations

#### 7.1. Substantially Similar Provisions

The UN Model Article 17 is substantially similar to the OECD Model. Both versions grant the source state the right to tax performance income, include the Article 17(2) look-through provision for payments to third parties, and use the same basic structure and terminology. Developing countries and developed countries alike recognise the special nature of entertainer and sportsperson income and the need for source taxation.

#### 7.2. Commentary Differences

The UN Commentary may reflect developing country perspectives on certain issues. Some countries have expressed broader interpretations of "entertainer" that may encompass models, fashion show participants, and speakers at certain events. Reservations and observations from countries like Argentina, Brazil, Malaysia, China, and India indicate divergent views on the precise scope of Article 17.

### 8. Practical Considerations

#### 8.1. Withholding Tax Enforcement

Source states typically enforce Article 17 taxation through withholding mechanisms. Event organisers or paying agents withhold tax from performance fees before payment to the performer or their company. This ensures compliance without requiring the performer to file returns in every jurisdiction where they perform briefly.

Withholding rates vary by jurisdiction and may be reduced under applicable treaties. However, withholding on gross income can create hardship where expenses are substantial, as performers may face effective tax rates exceeding their net profit margins.

#### 8.2. 2014 Commentary Reforms

The OECD recognised practical difficulties with Article 17 and, in the 2014 Commentary update, recommended several reforms for states to consider. These include exempting employed performers working for groups or orchestras, establishing minimum monetary thresholds below which source taxation does not apply (following the US Model approach), allowing deduction of expenses in calculating the taxable base, and limiting Article 17(2) to genuinely abusive arrangements rather than all third-party payment situations.

Some jurisdictions have implemented these recommendations through domestic law or bilateral treaty modifications. Others continue to apply Article 17 in its traditional form, taxing gross performance income without expense deductions or minimum thresholds.

#### 8.3. Major Sporting Events

Major international sporting events—the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, and similar competitions—often involve special tax arrangements. Host countries may provide exemptions or simplified procedures for visiting athletes and their support teams. These arrangements may be implemented through domestic legislation, host city agreements, or specific provisions in the applicable treaties.

The 2024 Paris Olympics, for example, involved France applying its treaty network to determine taxing rights over athlete income, with Article 17 serving as the baseline provision subject to any special exemptions negotiated for the event.

### 9. Emerging Issues

#### 9.1. Digital and Remote Performances

The growth of digital entertainment raises questions about Article 17's application to performances that do not involve physical presence in the source state. A musician who streams a live concert to viewers worldwide performs in their home studio, not in each viewer's country. Under traditional Article 17 interpretation, the performance is exercised where the performer is physically present—the home studio location—not where the audience is located.

This interpretation may limit source state taxation of digital performance income, as the performer never physically enters the audience's jurisdictions. Some commentators suggest that Article 17 may require reconsideration in light of digital entertainment trends, potentially expanding the concept of where a performance is "exercised" to include jurisdictions where substantial audiences consume the performance in real time.

#### 9.2. E-Sportspersons

Electronic sports competitions have grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry, with professional e-sportspersons earning substantial income from tournament prizes, sponsorships, and streaming activities. Whether e-sportspersons fall within Article 17 depends on characterisation: are they sportspersons, entertainers, or neither?

Strong arguments support inclusion. E-sports competitions involve skill-based competitive activities with audiences, prizes, and media coverage analogous to traditional sports. Many jurisdictions now recognise e-sports as sporting activities. If e-sportspersons are sportspersons for Article 17 purposes, their tournament income is subject to source taxation in countries where competitions are held.

Alternatively, e-sportspersons might qualify as entertainers if their activities are characterised as entertainment rather than sport. The Commentary's broad approach to entertainers—focusing on providing entertainment to audiences—supports this characterisation. Either way, Article 17 likely applies to e-sportspersons competing before live or broadcast audiences.

#### 9.3. Influencers and Content Creators

Social media influencers and content creators present additional boundary questions. An influencer who attends an event in a source state and creates content there may generate income closely connected to their presence. However, the income typically flows from advertising and sponsorship arrangements rather than direct performance fees.

Whether such income falls within Article 17 depends on whether the influencer's activities constitute "entertainment" and whether the income is sufficiently connected to source state activities. The analysis may require distinguishing between content creation (potentially Article 17 if entertaining an audience), advertising income (potentially Article 7 business profits), and royalties from content licensing (potentially Article 12).

### 10. Comparison with Domestic Approaches

#### 10.1. Variations in Treaty Practice

While Article 17 provides the baseline rule, actual treaties may modify the standard provision. Some treaties include minimum thresholds below which source taxation does not apply, following the US Model approach. Others limit Article 17(2) to abusive situations or exclude employed performers working for cultural organisations.

Treaties between countries with significant cultural exchange programmes may include exemptions for performers participating in government-sponsored cultural events. These variations reflect bilateral negotiations balancing revenue interests against the desire to facilitate artistic and sporting exchanges.

#### 10.2. Domestic Implementation

Domestic law determines how source states implement their Article 17 taxing rights. Some jurisdictions impose withholding taxes on gross performance fees at flat rates ranging from 15% to 30%. Others allow expense deductions before calculating the tax base, reducing effective rates for performers with substantial costs.

Compliance mechanisms also vary. Some countries require event organisers to withhold and remit tax before paying performers. Others permit performers to file returns and claim deductions after the engagement. The choice of mechanism affects both administrative burden and the performer's cash flow during international tours.
