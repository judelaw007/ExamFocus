## Chapter 10.2: Directors' Fees – Article 16, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 16

Article 16 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) allocates taxing rights over directors' fees—remuneration received by an individual in their capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company. This provision addresses a specific category of income that differs fundamentally from ordinary employment income in both its nature and the relationship between the recipient and the paying entity.

Directors occupy a unique position in corporate governance. Unlike employees who work under the direction of management, directors bear fiduciary responsibilities to the company and its shareholders. They participate in strategic decision-making, oversee management performance, and exercise supervisory functions that transcend the ordinary employment relationship. This special status justifies a distinct tax treatment under Article 16, separate from the employment income rules of Article 15.

#### 1.2. Historical Stability

Article 16 is one of the most stable provisions in the OECD Model Tax Convention. The article has remained virtually unchanged since the first OECD Model was published in 1963, consisting of only a single sentence. This remarkable stability reflects the clarity and simplicity of the underlying policy: remuneration for board membership should be taxable in the state where the company is resident, regardless of where the director actually performs their supervisory functions.

The stability of Article 16 contrasts with other provisions that have undergone significant revision over the decades. While articles dealing with permanent establishments, employment income, and digital services have been substantially amended to address evolving business practices, Article 16 has proven sufficiently robust to accommodate changing corporate governance structures without requiring amendment.

#### 1.3. Policy Rationale

The policy rationale for Article 16 rests on several considerations. Directors bear fiduciary responsibility to the company they serve, creating a close connection between the director's role and the company's residence state. Directors participate in strategic decisions that affect the company's operations, further strengthening the nexus to the company's jurisdiction. Perhaps most importantly, it would be practically difficult to determine where director functions are actually exercised—board meetings may occur in multiple locations, and much of a director's work involves reflection and communication that cannot be tied to a specific geographical location.

Unlike employment income under Article 15, where the place of physical presence determines source taxation, directors' fees are taxed based on the company's residence rather than the location where the director performs their duties. This approach provides certainty and simplicity: the company's residence is easily determinable, whereas tracking a director's movements would be administratively burdensome and potentially contentious.

### 2. The Text of Article 16

#### 2.1. OECD Model Article 16

Article 16 of the OECD MTC 2017 provides: "Directors' fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

This single sentence encompasses the entire rule. Its brevity reflects the straightforward nature of the allocation: the company's residence state may tax directors' fees regardless of where the director resides or where the director performs their functions.

#### 2.2. Structure and Elements

The provision contains several key elements. The income covered comprises "directors' fees and other similar payments," extending beyond fixed fees to include variable compensation and benefits in kind. The recipient must be "a resident of a Contracting State," establishing the treaty framework within which the provision operates. The critical requirement is that the payment be derived "in his capacity as a member of the board of directors"—this capacity test determines whether Article 16 or Article 15 applies. The payer must be "a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State," creating the cross-border element that engages the treaty. Finally, the taxing right is expressed as "may be taxed in that other State," indicating that the company's residence state has the right, but not the obligation, to tax the remuneration.

### 3. Scope of Article 16

#### 3.1. Directors' Fees and Similar Payments

The term "directors' fees and other similar payments" encompasses various forms of remuneration received in the capacity of a board member. This includes fixed fees for board membership, attendance fees for board meetings, and variable compensation tied to company performance. The OECD Commentary confirms that benefits in kind received in connection with board membership also fall within Article 16. Such benefits may include stock options granted to directors, use of company residence or vehicle, health or life insurance coverage, and club memberships.

However, not all payments to directors fall within Article 16. Salaries paid to directors for day-to-day management activities are treated as employment income under Article 15. Pension payments to former directors fall within Article 18. Remuneration for services provided in a capacity other than as a director—such as consultancy work or technical services—falls outside Article 16 and may be governed by other treaty provisions.

#### 3.2. The Capacity Requirement

The phrase "in his capacity as a member of the board of directors" establishes the critical test for Article 16 applicability. The payment must be for services performed as a director, not for other roles the individual may hold. This capacity requirement is central to distinguishing Article 16 income from Article 15 employment income.

Where an individual serves as both a director and an employee—as is common with managing directors or executive directors—the remuneration must be allocated between the two roles. Fees paid specifically for board membership fall within Article 16, while salary for management functions falls within Article 15. This allocation may require analysis of employment contracts, board resolutions, and the actual functions performed by the individual.

#### 3.3. Board of Directors: Interpretation Issues

The term "board of directors" is not defined in the Model Convention, leading to interpretation challenges across different legal systems. The Commentary indicates that Article 16 covers remuneration to members of organs that are competent for "general supervision over the management of the company."

Corporate governance structures vary significantly between jurisdictions. Some countries employ a one-tier board system, where a single board of directors combines supervisory and management functions. Other countries, notably Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Denmark, employ a two-tier board system with separate supervisory and management boards.

In Germany's two-tier system, the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) oversees management and appoints members of the management board (Vorstand). The supervisory board's role is primarily oversight—it does not engage in day-to-day management. Members of the supervisory board clearly fall within Article 16 as they exercise the general supervisory functions contemplated by the Commentary. Members of the management board, however, exercise executive functions and may be characterised as employees subject to Article 15 rather than directors under Article 16.

The distinction matters because it determines which treaty article governs the taxation of remuneration. Where domestic law classifications differ between contracting states, competent authority consultation may be necessary to resolve conflicts.

#### 3.4. The Taxing Right

The phrase "may be taxed in that other State" grants the company's residence state a right, not an obligation, to tax directors' fees. The individual's residence state also retains taxing rights, creating shared taxation that requires double taxation relief under Article 23.

Unlike Article 15(2), which provides an exception for short-term employment, Article 16 contains no conditions, thresholds, or exceptions. The 183-day rule has no application to directors' fees. The company's residence state may tax regardless of how few days the director spends in that state or how frequently board meetings occur there. This simplicity reflects the policy judgment that directors' connection to the company—rather than their physical presence—justifies source state taxation.

### 4. Relationship with Article 15

#### 4.1. Lex Specialis Principle

Article 16 operates as a lex specialis—a special provision that takes precedence over the more general rules of Article 15 for employment income. When analysing the treaty treatment of payments to individuals, Article 16 (along with Articles 17, 18, and 19) must be considered before applying Article 15. If the payment falls within one of these specific provisions, that provision applies exclusively; Article 15 is only engaged for income not covered by the special provisions. *(covered in June 2023)*

This approach reflects sound treaty interpretation principles. Specific provisions designed to address particular circumstances take precedence over general provisions that address the broader category. A payment to a director falls within both Article 15 (as remuneration for services) and Article 16 (as directors' fees), but Article 16's specific treatment prevails.

#### 4.2. Distinguishing Director from Employee Roles

The distinction between Article 16 and Article 15 turns on the capacity in which the individual receives payment. Under Article 16, the relevant nexus is the company's residence—where the director works is irrelevant. Under Article 15, the relevant nexus is where the employment is exercised—the employee's physical presence determines source taxation. The 183-day exception in Article 15(2) has no counterpart in Article 16; directors' fees are taxable in the company's state regardless of the director's length of presence.

These differences create planning opportunities and compliance obligations. A director who never visits the company's country of residence may nonetheless owe tax there on directors' fees. Conversely, an employee who spends substantial time in a country may avoid source taxation if the conditions of Article 15(2) are satisfied.

#### 4.3. Dual-Role Individuals

Many senior corporate officers hold dual roles: they serve on the board of directors while also performing executive management functions. A managing director, for example, typically sits on the board while simultaneously managing the company's day-to-day operations. In such cases, the remuneration must be allocated between the two roles.

The allocation follows the capacity test: fees paid for board membership fall within Article 16, while salary for management work falls within Article 15. This may require separate identification of payments or apportionment of aggregate remuneration based on the functions performed. Where contracts or board resolutions do not clearly distinguish the components, the actual nature of the work and typical compensation practices may inform the allocation.

### 5. UN Model Differences

#### 5.1. Article 16(2): Top-Level Managerial Positions

The UN Model Double Taxation Convention contains a significant extension of Article 16 that does not appear in the OECD Model. While paragraph 1 of UN Article 16 mirrors the OECD provision on directors' fees, paragraph 2 extends company-residence-state taxation to remuneration paid to "top-level managerial officials."

UN Model Article 16(2) provides: "Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as an official in a top-level managerial position of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

#### 5.2. Scope and Definition

The term "top-level managerial position" refers to a limited group of positions that involve primary responsibility for the general direction of the company's affairs, apart from the activities of the directors. The UN Commentary characterises these positions as senior executive roles distinct from both board membership and ordinary management. Typical examples include the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), and other C-suite executives who exercise primary responsibility for company direction.

The key characteristics of top-level managerial positions include senior executive status, primary responsibility for company direction, and a role distinct from that of the board of directors. The extension does not cover rank-and-file management or middle managers who implement rather than set strategic direction.

#### 5.3. Policy Rationale

The UN Model's extension reflects developing country concerns about the taxation of executive compensation. Under the OECD Model, a CEO resident in one country but working for a company resident in another would be taxed under Article 15 based on where the employment is exercised—potentially the CEO's residence state if work is performed remotely or the company has no physical presence requiring attendance.

Developing countries argued that high-level executives derive value from their connection to the company and should be subject to taxation in the company's residence state, similar to directors. The UN Model's Article 16(2) addresses this concern by granting source taxation rights over executive remuneration, allowing developing countries to capture tax revenue from senior management compensation even where executives do not physically work in the source state.

The OECD has not adopted this extension, reflecting the view that employment income taxation should follow the place-of-work principle rather than the company's residence. Treaties following the OECD Model will not include Article 16(2), while those following the UN Model may include it depending on negotiating positions.

### 6. Interpretive Challenges

#### 6.1. Domestic Law Variations

Under Article 3(2) of the Model Conventions, terms not defined in the treaty may be interpreted according to the domestic law of the applying state, unless context otherwise requires. This creates potential for different interpretations of "board of directors" across treaty partners.

A company organ that qualifies as a board of directors under one state's law may not be recognised as such under the other state's law. The resulting classification mismatch could lead to both states claiming taxation rights under Article 16, or neither state recognising Article 16 as applicable. Competent authority procedures under Article 25 may be necessary to resolve such conflicts.

#### 6.2. One-Tier vs Two-Tier Board Systems

The distinction between one-tier and two-tier board systems creates particular interpretation challenges. In one-tier systems, a single board exercises both supervisory and management functions, and members clearly fall within Article 16 for their board role. In two-tier systems, the supervisory board provides oversight while the management board runs the company.

The Commentary suggests that Article 16 applies to members of organs competent for "general supervision over the management of the company." Supervisory board members clearly satisfy this test. Management board members exercise executive rather than supervisory functions and may be characterised as employees under Article 15. However, some management board positions may involve sufficient oversight responsibilities to engage Article 16, requiring case-by-case analysis.

#### 6.3. Legal Persons as Directors

Article 16 applies to directors who are "a resident of a Contracting State," and this includes legal persons. A company may appoint another company to serve on its board of directors, and directors' fees paid to the corporate director fall within Article 16 if the corporate director is resident in the other contracting state.

The characterisation of the payment at the level of the corporate director raises additional questions. The corporate director receives directors' fees within Article 16, but further distributions or allocations by the corporate director to individuals may engage other treaty provisions. The interaction between entity-level and individual-level taxation requires careful analysis of both the treaty and domestic law treatment.

### 7. Practical Application

#### 7.1. Cross-Border Directorship Scenarios

Article 16 commonly applies where an individual resident in one country serves on the board of a company incorporated in another country. This scenario arises frequently in multinational corporate groups, where parent company executives may serve on subsidiary boards, or where companies seek independent directors with expertise from other jurisdictions.

Consider an individual resident in State A who serves on the board of a company resident in State B. Under Article 16, the directors' fees paid by the State B company may be taxed by State B regardless of where board meetings are held or where the director performs preparatory work. State A, as the director's residence state, also has taxing rights. Double taxation relief under Article 23 of the applicable treaty addresses the overlap, typically through either an exemption or credit method in the residence state.

#### 7.2. Interaction with Domestic Law

Article 16 allocates taxing rights between treaty partners but does not create taxation where domestic law does not impose it. Each contracting state retains the discretion to tax or not tax directors' fees to the extent permitted by Article 16. Some jurisdictions impose withholding taxes on directors' fees paid to non-residents, while others may not have mechanisms to tax such payments.

The practical effect of Article 16 depends on the interaction between the treaty and domestic law of both states. A director may find that while the treaty permits source state taxation, the source state's domestic law does not in fact impose tax on the payment, or imposes tax at a rate lower than the treaty permits. Treaty provisions set the ceiling on source state taxation; they do not set the floor.
