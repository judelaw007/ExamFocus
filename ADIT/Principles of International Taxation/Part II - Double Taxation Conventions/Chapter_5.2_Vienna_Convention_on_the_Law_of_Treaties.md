## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE VCLT AND TAX TREATIES

### 1.1 What is the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties?

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), adopted in 1969 and in force since 1980, is the foundational instrument of public international law governing treaties. It has been described as the "treaty on treaties" and codifies customary international law on treaty interpretation.

**Key facts**:
- Adopted: 23 May 1969
- Entry into force: 27 January 1980
- Parties: Over 115 states
- Status: Many provisions (especially Articles 31-32) reflect customary international law, binding even on non-parties

### 1.2 Application to Double Taxation Conventions

DTCs are international treaties and therefore subject to the VCLT framework. As stated in the June 2024 exam solution: *"The VCLT provides the legal framework for the creation, interpretation and application of treaties, including DTAs (which are a form of international treaty, Art. 2 VCLT)."*

However, DTCs have special characteristics that affect VCLT application:

| Feature | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Article 3(2) OECD MTC | Special interpretation rule referring to domestic law |
| Model-based drafting | OECD/UN Commentaries as extrinsic materials |
| Technical nature | Terms may have specialised tax meanings |
| Bilateral structure | Two States' domestic laws interact with treaty |

The relationship between the VCLT general rules and Article 3(2) OECD MTC is a central interpretive question. Article 3(2) has been described as "a special rule relative to the general rules contained within the VCLT" (Dourado et al, 2022).

---

## 2. ARTICLE 31 VCLT: THE GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION

Article 31 establishes the **primary rule** for treaty interpretation. Courts must apply Article 31 before having recourse to supplementary means under Article 32.

### 2.1 Article 31(1): The Core Principle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ARTICLE 31(1) VCLT                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  "A treaty shall be interpreted in GOOD FAITH in accordance    │
│   with the ORDINARY MEANING to be given to the terms of the    │
│   treaty in their CONTEXT and in the light of its OBJECT AND   │
│   PURPOSE."                                                     │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This encapsulates three interconnected elements:

| Element | Meaning | Application to DTCs |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Good faith** | Honest, reasonable interpretation | Cannot interpret to frustrate treaty purposes |
| **Ordinary meaning** | Natural meaning of words in context | Technical tax terms may have specialised meanings |
| **Object and purpose** | Treaty's aims and goals | Elimination of double taxation; prevention of abuse (post-BEPS) |

**Good Faith (Bona Fides)**:
- Fundamental principle of international law
- Requires honest interpretation without ulterior motives
- States must not interpret treaties to evade obligations
- Linked to the principle *pacta sunt servanda* (agreements must be kept)

**Ordinary Meaning**:
- Starting point is natural, grammatical meaning
- Technical terms may have specialised meanings
- Context modifies ordinary meaning where appropriate
- Different authentic language versions may be considered (Article 33)

**Object and Purpose**:
- Interpretation must align with treaty goals
- For DTCs, historically: elimination of double taxation, facilitation of trade
- Post-BEPS: Prevention of tax evasion and avoidance now explicitly stated in Preamble
- Object and purpose cannot override clear text, but informs ambiguous provisions

### 2.2 Article 31(2): Defining "Context"

**Article 31(2)** defines what constitutes the "context" for interpretation purposes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 ARTICLE 31(2) - CONTEXT                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  The CONTEXT for the purpose of interpretation comprises:       │
│                                                                 │
│  (a) The treaty TEXT, including PREAMBLE and ANNEXES            │
│                                                                 │
│  (b) Any AGREEMENT relating to the treaty made between          │
│      ALL parties in connection with treaty conclusion           │
│                                                                 │
│  (c) Any INSTRUMENT made by one or more parties in connection   │
│      with treaty conclusion and ACCEPTED by other parties       │
│      as related to the treaty                                   │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Application to DTCs**:

| Context Element | DTC Examples |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Treaty text | The DTC articles themselves |
| Preamble | OECD MTC 2017 Preamble (post-BEPS, refers to preventing abuse) |
| Annexes | Protocol provisions, if any |
| Agreements between parties | Exchange of notes at treaty conclusion |
| Instruments accepted | Memoranda of understanding |

**Exam Point—MLI Explanatory Statement**: The status of the MLI Explanatory Statement under Article 31(2) is debated. June 2024 Q2 noted it may qualify as "an agreement relating to a treaty that was made between the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty" per Article 31(2)(a) (Manzi, 2020).

### 2.3 Article 31(3): Additional Interpretive Elements

**Article 31(3)** extends interpretation beyond formal context:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          ARTICLE 31(3) - TOGETHER WITH CONTEXT                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  There shall be taken into account, together with context:      │
│                                                                 │
│  (a) Any SUBSEQUENT AGREEMENT between parties regarding         │
│      interpretation or application                              │
│                                                                 │
│  (b) Any SUBSEQUENT PRACTICE in application of the treaty       │
│      establishing agreement on interpretation                   │
│                                                                 │
│  (c) Any relevant RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW applicable         │
│      between the parties                                        │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Subsequent Agreement (Article 31(3)(a))**:
- Formal or informal agreements after treaty conclusion
- MAP conclusions may constitute subsequent agreement
- Competent authority agreements on specific issues

**Subsequent Practice (Article 31(3)(b))**:
- Consistent practice in applying treaty provisions
- Must establish parties' agreement on interpretation
- OECD Commentary updates—debated whether they qualify

**Rules of International Law (Article 31(3)(c))**:
- Other treaties, customary international law
- General principles of law
- May include EU law for EU Member States

### 2.4 Article 31(4): Special Meanings

**Article 31(4)**: *"A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended."*

This allows departure from ordinary meaning where:
- Parties intended a technical or specialised meaning
- The special meaning can be demonstrated
- Burden of proof is on the party asserting special meaning

**Application**: Tax treaties often use terms with special tax meanings (e.g., "permanent establishment", "beneficial owner"). Article 31(4) supports giving these terms their specialised tax meaning rather than general dictionary definitions.

## 3. ARTICLE 32 VCLT: SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION

### 3.1 The Role of Supplementary Means

**Article 32** permits recourse to supplementary means in specific circumstances:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               ARTICLE 32 VCLT - SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation,  │
│  including the PREPARATORY WORK (travaux préparatoires) and     │
│  the CIRCUMSTANCES OF CONCLUSION, in order to:                  │
│                                                                 │
│  (a) CONFIRM the meaning from Article 31 application            │
│                                                                 │
│  OR                                                             │
│                                                                 │
│  (b) DETERMINE the meaning when Article 31 interpretation:      │
│      • Leaves the meaning AMBIGUOUS or OBSCURE, or              │
│      • Leads to a result which is MANIFESTLY ABSURD or          │
│        UNREASONABLE                                             │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Hierarchy of Interpretation

The VCLT establishes a **two-tier hierarchy**:

| Tier | Source | When Applied |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Primary** (Art. 31) | Text, context, object/purpose, subsequent agreement/practice | Always—mandatory first step |
| **Supplementary** (Art. 32) | Preparatory work, circumstances | Only to confirm or resolve ambiguity |

**Important**: Courts should not jump directly to supplementary means. Article 31 must be applied first.

### 3.3 What Constitutes "Supplementary Means"?

Article 32 explicitly mentions:
- **Preparatory work (travaux préparatoires)**: Negotiating records, drafts, memoranda
- **Circumstances of conclusion**: Historical context, political background

**The list is not exhaustive** ("including"). Other supplementary means may include:
- OECD/UN Model Commentaries (debated—see Chapter 5.3)
- Academic writings
- Comparative case law from other jurisdictions
- OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs reports

**Exam Point**: The status of OECD Commentaries under Article 32 is controversial. The June 2024 exam noted: *"The terms of the OECD Commentaries can be considered supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32. However, such recourse is only available to confirm an interpretation that has already been reached by the court using the rules outlined in Article 31, or in cases where the application of these rules leaves the meaning obscure."*

## 4. APPLICATION OF VCLT TO DTC INTERPRETATION

### 4.1 The Integrated Framework

When interpreting a DTC provision, apply this integrated VCLT/DTC framework:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         INTEGRATED VCLT/DTC INTERPRETATION FRAMEWORK            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 1: Apply ARTICLE 31(1) VCLT                               │
│          • Good faith                                           │
│          • Ordinary meaning of terms                            │
│          • In context                                           │
│          • In light of object and purpose                       │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 2: Consider CONTEXT per ARTICLE 31(2)                     │
│          • Treaty text (including Preamble)                     │
│          • Related agreements/instruments                       │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 3: Consider ARTICLE 31(3) elements                        │
│          • Subsequent agreements                                │
│          • Subsequent practice                                   │
│          • Relevant international law rules                     │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 4: If term UNDEFINED in treaty, apply ARTICLE 3(2) MTC    │
│          • "Unless context otherwise requires"                  │
│          • Reference to domestic law at time of application     │
│                                                                 │
│  STEP 5: If needed, use SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS (Art. 32)           │
│          • To confirm meaning, OR                               │
│          • To resolve ambiguity/absurdity                       │
│          • OECD Commentary (if applicable)                      │
│          • Preparatory work                                     │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Relationship: VCLT Article 31 vs DTC Article 3(2)

A fundamental question is how Article 3(2) OECD MTC interacts with VCLT Articles 31-32:

**Article 3(2) OECD MTC**: *"...any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State..."*

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| **Art. 3(2) as lex specialis** | Art. 3(2) is a special rule for DTCs that modifies VCLT general rules |
| **VCLT as primary** | VCLT governs; Art. 3(2) operates within VCLT framework as one interpretive tool |
| **Integrated approach** | Both work together—VCLT provides framework, Art. 3(2) is part of treaty context |

The prevailing view is the **integrated approach**: Article 3(2) is itself part of the treaty text interpreted under VCLT Article 31. The phrase "unless the context otherwise requires" invokes VCLT contextual interpretation.

### 4.3 The Preamble's Role Post-BEPS

The OECD MTC 2017 Preamble states parties intend to:
- Eliminate double taxation
- **Not create opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation** through tax evasion or avoidance
- **Prevent treaty shopping** arrangements

Under Article 31(2) VCLT, the Preamble is part of the context. This has significant interpretive implications:

**Pre-BEPS**: Primary focus was eliminating double taxation
**Post-BEPS**: Prevention of abuse is equally important

**Exam Application**: When analysing provisions like Article 29 (PPT) or beneficial ownership, the Preamble's anti-abuse language supports interpretations that prevent treaty shopping.

## 5. VCLT PROVISIONS BEYOND INTERPRETATION

### 5.1 Treaty Formation and Validity (Articles 1-25)

While Articles 31-32 are most important for interpretation, other VCLT provisions are exam-relevant:

| VCLT Article | Subject | DTC Relevance |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| Art. 2 | Definitions | DTCs are "treaties" under VCLT |
| Art. 26 | Pacta sunt servanda | Treaties are binding; must be performed in good faith |
| Art. 27 | Internal law no excuse | Cannot invoke domestic law to justify treaty non-performance |
| Art. 30 | Successive treaties | MLI interaction with bilateral DTCs |

### 5.2 Treaty Termination and Suspension (Articles 54-64)

The June 2024 exam (Q1) extensively tested VCLT termination provisions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          VCLT PROVISIONS ON TERMINATION/SUSPENSION              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  Art. 54: Termination by consent or treaty provisions           │
│  Art. 56: Denunciation where no termination provision           │
│  Art. 57: Suspension by consent or treaty provisions            │
│  Art. 60: Termination/suspension for material breach            │
│  Art. 61: Supervening impossibility of performance              │
│  Art. 62: Fundamental change of circumstances                   │
│  Art. 63: Severance of diplomatic relations                     │
│  Art. 64: Emergence of new peremptory norm (jus cogens)         │
│  Art. 65: Procedure for termination/suspension                  │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Exam Example—Russia DTC Suspensions**: The June 2024 exam discussed Russia's suspension of DTC provisions with "unfriendly states" and whether this complied with VCLT:
- Art. 60: Material breach required—debated whether EOI refusal qualifies
- Art. 57: Suspension requires mutual consent or treaty provision
- Art. 26(2)(c): Public policy exception may justify EOI refusal without constituting breach

---

## 6. THE MLI EXPLANATORY STATEMENT AND VCLT

### 6.1 Status Under VCLT

The MLI Explanatory Statement's legal status is controversial but exam-relevant (June 2024 Q2):

**Possible characterisations**:

| VCLT Basis | Argument |
|-----------|----------|
| **Art. 31(2)(a)** | Agreement made between parties in connection with treaty conclusion—binding on ad hoc group members |
| **Art. 31(2)(b)** | Instrument accepted by parties as related to treaty—may bind non-ad hoc members who freely adopted MLI |
| **Art. 31(4)** | Establishes special meanings intended by parties |
| **Art. 32** | Supplementary means of interpretation—not binding but persuasive |

**Key point**: The Explanatory Statement states it "reflects the agreed understanding of the negotiators" but is not part of the MLI text itself.

### 6.2 BEPS Reports and VCLT

The 2015 BEPS Final Reports influenced the OECD MTC 2017 but were not attached to the MTC. Their status:
- **Not** context under Article 31(2)—not made in connection with specific DTC conclusions
- **Potentially** supplementary means under Article 32
- **Influence** via incorporation into OECD MTC Commentary

As noted in June 2024 Q2: *"The BEPS reports were not attached to the MTC but rather aspects of the reports were incorporated into the provisions and/or included in the Commentary."*

## 7. KEY CASES ON VCLT APPLICATION

### 7.1 Cases Applying VCLT to Tax Treaties

| Case | Key VCLT Issue | Outcome |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Fothergill v Monarch Airlines** [1981] (UK HL) | Article 31 application | Leading authority on VCLT interpretation in UK courts |
| **United States v Stuart** [1989] (US SC) | Good faith interpretation | Treaty interpreted to give effect to parties' intent |
| **Tomimaru v Japan** [2007] (Japan) | Object and purpose | DTC interpreted considering anti-avoidance purpose |
| **Alta Energy** [2021] (Canada SCC) | Context; Commentary role | Treaty text prevails; later Commentary not determinative |

### 7.2 Alta Energy (2021)—VCLT in Practice

The Canadian Supreme Court in Alta Energy applied VCLT principles:

**VCLT Article 31 application**:
- Started with ordinary meaning of treaty text
- Considered object and purpose (eliminating double taxation AND facilitating trade)
- Majority held: Cannot "read in" requirements not present in text

**VCLT Article 32 application**:
- Commentary updates after treaty conclusion not determinative
- Subsequent Commentary cannot change parties' original intentions

**Key quote**: The court noted that reservations/observations affect whether Commentary guidance applies to a country's treaties.

### 8.2 Common Exam Triggers

| Question Phrase | Focus Area |
|-----------------|------------|
| "Apply the VCLT to..." | Full Article 31-32 analysis |
| "What is the status of [document] under the VCLT?" | Article 31(2)-(3) or Article 32 classification |
| "How should this provision be interpreted..." | Integrated VCLT/Article 3(2) analysis |
| "Can the DTC be terminated/suspended..." | Articles 54-64 |
| "What role does the Preamble play..." | Article 31(2)—context |

## 9. CONNECTIONS TO OTHER TOPICS

### 9.1 Building on Previous Notes

This chapter builds on:
- **Chapter 5.1 (General Approach)**: VCLT provides the legal foundation for interpretation principles discussed
- **Chapter 4 (DTC Application)**: VCLT governs how distributive rules are interpreted

### 9.2 Connections to Later Chapters

This chapter provides foundation for:
- **Chapter 5.3 (OECD Commentaries)**: VCLT status of Commentaries as context/supplementary means
- **Chapter 5.4 (Article 3(2))**: Relationship between VCLT and domestic law reference
- **Chapter 5.5 (Competent Authority)**: MAP as subsequent agreement under Article 31(3)(a)

## 10. ERROR PREVENTION

### Common Mistakes

| Error | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Jumping to Article 32 without Article 31 | ALWAYS apply Article 31 first |
| Treating OECD Commentary as binding | Commentary is persuasive, not binding |
| Ignoring the Preamble | Post-BEPS, Preamble is crucial context |
| Confusing context (Art. 31(2)) with supplementary means (Art. 32) | Context is primary; supplementary is secondary |
| Applying VCLT without mentioning DTC Article 3(2) | Integrate both frameworks |
| Forgetting "good faith" requirement | Good faith underlies all interpretation |
