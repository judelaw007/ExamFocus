# Chapter 5.2: Interpretation of DTCs – Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties

## 1. Introduction: The VCLT and Tax Treaties

### 1.1. Nature and Status of the Vienna Convention

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), adopted on 23 May 1969 and entering into force on 27 January 1980, is the foundational instrument of public international law governing treaties. Often described as the "treaty on treaties," the VCLT codifies the rules for the creation, interpretation, modification, and termination of international agreements between states.

The VCLT has been ratified by over 115 states. Importantly, many of its provisions—particularly Articles 31 to 33 on interpretation—are recognised as reflecting customary international law. This means they bind even states that have not formally ratified the Convention. The International Court of Justice and investment tribunals have consistently treated these interpretation articles as customary law, making them universally applicable to treaty interpretation regardless of formal VCLT membership.

The Convention applies to treaties between states concluded after its entry into force. A treaty is defined in Article 2(1)(a) as "an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation." Double taxation conventions clearly fall within this definition and are therefore subject to the VCLT framework.

### 1.2. Application to Double Taxation Conventions

DTCs are international treaties and therefore subject to the VCLT framework. The VCLT provides the legal framework for the creation, interpretation, and application of treaties, including DTCs. *(covered in December 2024)*

However, DTCs possess special characteristics that affect how the VCLT is applied. Article 3(2) of the OECD Model provides a specific interpretation rule referring to domestic law for undefined terms. DTCs are drafted on the basis of model conventions, making the OECD and UN Commentaries relevant extrinsic materials. The technical nature of tax law means that terms may carry specialised meanings. The bilateral structure means two states' domestic tax systems interact with the same treaty provisions.

The relationship between the general VCLT rules and the specific provisions of DTCs has been described by scholars as creating "a special category of treaties, distinct from other types of treaties—in both implementation and modification." This distinctive character affects how courts apply VCLT interpretation principles in the tax treaty context.

## 2. Article 31: The General Rule of Interpretation

### 2.1. The Unified Interpretive Approach

Article 31 establishes the primary rule for treaty interpretation. Courts must apply Article 31 before having recourse to supplementary means under Article 32. The provision sets out a unified interpretive approach rather than a sequence of separate steps.

Article 31(1) provides that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. These elements—good faith, ordinary meaning, context, and object and purpose—form a single interpretive operation applied holistically rather than as a mechanical checklist.

### 2.2. Good Faith Interpretation

The requirement of good faith interpretation is fundamental to the VCLT framework. Good faith, or bona fides, is a foundational principle of international law linked to the maxim pacta sunt servanda—the principle that agreements must be honoured.

In treaty interpretation, good faith requires honest and reasonable interpretation adhering to the parties' common intentions. It demands rejection of interpretations that frustrate treaty purposes. States must engage in fair dealing and cannot interpret provisions to evade their obligations. Interpretations that achieve results contrary to the treaty's object are impermissible.

The good faith requirement means that a state cannot adopt a literal interpretation that defeats the purpose of the treaty merely because such an interpretation is technically available. Equally, it does not permit an expansive interpretation that imposes obligations beyond those agreed by the parties.

### 2.3. Ordinary Meaning of Terms

The emphasis on ordinary meaning makes clear that the goal of interpretation is not the reconstruction of subjective intentions if those intentions are not reflected in the text. Rather, the objective is to determine the objective meaning of the text, which may refer to the presumed intention of the parties.

The wording of the treaty is simultaneously the starting point and the outer boundary of interpretation. However, ordinary meaning does not mandate a purely literal interpretation. Technical terms may carry specialised meanings, and context modifies the ordinary meaning where appropriate. Different authentic language versions may also be considered under Article 33.

For DTCs, this principle means that tax terms should generally be given their ordinary tax law meaning unless the treaty indicates otherwise. Terms such as "permanent establishment," "beneficial owner," and "enterprise" may carry technical meanings derived from international tax practice rather than general dictionary definitions.

### 2.4. Context Under Article 31(2)

Article 31(2) defines what constitutes context for interpretation purposes. The context for treaty interpretation comprises the text of the treaty itself, including its preamble and any annexes. It also includes any agreement relating to the treaty made between all parties in connection with its conclusion, and any instrument made by one or more parties in connection with the treaty's conclusion and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

For DTCs, the treaty text encompasses all articles of the convention. The preamble is particularly significant post-BEPS, as the OECD Model 2017 Preamble now expressly states that the convention is intended to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. This anti-abuse language forms part of the context and affects interpretation of all substantive provisions.

Protocols to DTCs, exchanges of notes at treaty conclusion, and memoranda of understanding may also form part of the context. The status of the MLI Explanatory Statement under Article 31(2) remains debated, with some scholars arguing it qualifies as an agreement relating to the treaty under Article 31(2)(a) for members of the ad hoc group that negotiated the MLI.

### 2.5. Subsequent Agreements and Practice (Article 31(3))

Article 31(3) extends the interpretive materials beyond the formal context established at treaty conclusion. Together with the context, interpreters must take into account any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation or application of the treaty, any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the parties' agreement concerning its interpretation, and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.

Subsequent agreements may include formal or informal arrangements reached after treaty conclusion. Mutual Agreement Procedure conclusions may constitute subsequent agreement for the specific case addressed. Competent authority agreements on interpretation of particular provisions may qualify if accepted by both parties.

Subsequent practice requires consistent conduct in applying treaty provisions that demonstrates the parties' shared understanding. Whether OECD Commentary updates constitute subsequent practice is debated. The prevailing view treats Commentary updates as potential evidence of subsequent practice but not automatically binding.

Relevant rules of international law include other treaties, customary international law, and general principles of law. For EU Member States, EU law may be relevant to DTC interpretation where applicable.

### 2.6. Special Meanings (Article 31(4))

Article 31(4) provides that a special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. This permits departure from ordinary meaning where the parties intended a technical or specialised meaning. The burden of proving that a special meaning was intended falls on the party asserting it.

This provision supports giving specialised tax meanings to terms that have developed particular significance in international tax practice. Where parties negotiating based on the OECD Model demonstrably intended a term to have its Model Commentary meaning, Article 31(4) may justify adopting that meaning over a general dictionary definition.

## 3. Article 32: Supplementary Means of Interpretation

### 3.1. Role and Hierarchy

Article 32 provides for recourse to supplementary means of interpretation. These include the preparatory work of the treaty (travaux préparatoires) and the circumstances of its conclusion. Supplementary means may be used to confirm the meaning resulting from application of Article 31, or to determine the meaning when Article 31 interpretation leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

The VCLT establishes a clear two-tier hierarchy. Article 31 materials are primary and must be applied first. Article 32 materials are supplementary and may only be consulted to confirm the Article 31 meaning or to resolve genuine ambiguity or absurdity. Courts should not bypass Article 31 and proceed directly to supplementary means.

In practice, courts frequently consult supplementary materials. The confirmatory function of Article 32 permits reference to preparatory work even when the Article 31 meaning is clear, provided the supplementary materials are used only to confirm rather than to contradict that meaning.

### 3.2. Travaux Préparatoires

Travaux préparatoires refers to the documents used during negotiation and drafting of a treaty. For bilateral DTCs, these may include negotiating records, draft versions, and diplomatic correspondence between the contracting states.

This category is the most controversial element of the VCLT, as it relegates negotiating history to a secondary role. Some legal traditions, particularly civil law systems, accord significant weight to legislative history. The VCLT's hierarchical approach subordinates such materials to the treaty text itself.

For DTCs based on the OECD Model, the travaux préparatoires of the Model itself—including earlier Commentary versions and working party documents—may be relevant. However, these are not strictly preparatory work for any particular bilateral treaty and their status remains debated.

### 3.3. Circumstances of Conclusion

The circumstances of a treaty's conclusion include the historical context, political background, and factual situation prevailing when the treaty was negotiated. For DTCs, this may include the economic relationship between the contracting states, prevailing tax policy concerns, and the state of international tax practice at the time of negotiation.

### 3.4. Status of OECD Commentary

The OECD Model Commentary's classification under the VCLT is extensively debated. The prevailing view, endorsed by the Australian High Court in Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990), treats the Commentaries as supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32.

In Thiel, Justice McHugh observed that whilst the Model and Commentaries may not strictly amount to work preparatory to a particular DTC, they are documents that form the basis for bilateral agreements and provide a guide to the current usage of terms by the parties. They are therefore supplementary means of interpretation to which recourse may be had under Article 32.

Some judges in Thiel expressed the view that the Commentary might also qualify under Article 31 as part of the context, being an instrument made in connection with treaties and accepted by parties as related. However, this broader view remains contested.

The practical consequence is that courts treat the Commentary as persuasive but non-binding guidance, with weight depending on factors including the cogency of reasoning, whether the treaty follows Model wording, and whether the relevant country has registered reservations or observations.

## 4. Article 33: Treaties in Multiple Languages

### 4.1. Equal Authenticity

Article 33 addresses treaties authenticated in two or more languages. When a treaty has been authenticated in multiple languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language unless the treaty provides otherwise. There is a presumption that treaty terms have the same meaning in each authentic text.

DTCs are typically concluded in the official languages of both contracting states and often in a third language—commonly English or French—as an additional authentic text. Protocol provisions may specify which text prevails in case of divergence.

### 4.2. Reconciling Divergent Texts

When comparison of authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning not resolved by application of Articles 31 and 32, Article 33(4) requires adoption of the meaning that best reconciles the texts, having regard to the treaty's object and purpose.

This provision is particularly important for DTCs given their multilingual nature. Where linguistic versions diverge, the interpreter must seek the meaning that harmonises the texts while advancing the treaty's object of eliminating double taxation.

## 5. Application to DTC Interpretation

### 5.1. The Integrated VCLT/DTC Framework

When interpreting a DTC provision, courts apply an integrated framework combining VCLT principles with DTC-specific rules. The sequence begins with application of Article 31(1) VCLT—interpretation in good faith according to ordinary meaning, in context, and in light of object and purpose. The interpreter then considers context under Article 31(2), including the preamble and any related agreements. Article 31(3) elements—subsequent agreements, subsequent practice, and relevant international law—are taken into account.

If the term is undefined in the treaty, Article 3(2) of the OECD Model directs reference to domestic law unless the context otherwise requires. Only if needed should supplementary means under Article 32 be consulted to confirm or resolve ambiguity.

### 5.2. Relationship with Article 3(2) OECD MTC

A fundamental question concerns how Article 3(2) OECD MTC interacts with the VCLT framework. Article 3(2) provides that any term not defined in the convention shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning it has under the law of the applying state.

Three views have been advanced on this relationship. The lex specialis view treats Article 3(2) as a special rule for DTCs that modifies the general VCLT rules. The VCLT primacy view holds that the VCLT governs, with Article 3(2) operating as one interpretive tool within that framework. The integrated approach—now prevailing—treats Article 3(2) as itself part of the treaty text interpreted under VCLT Article 31.

Under the integrated approach, Article 3(2) is not an exception to the VCLT but rather operates within it. The phrase "unless the context otherwise requires" itself invokes VCLT contextual interpretation. When context supports an autonomous international meaning, Article 3(2) does not mandate domestic law reference.

### 5.3. The Role of the Preamble Post-BEPS

The OECD Model 2017 Preamble states that the convention is intended to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including through treaty-shopping arrangements.

Under Article 31(2) VCLT, the preamble is part of the context. This has significant interpretive implications. Before BEPS, the primary focus of DTC interpretation was elimination of double taxation. Post-BEPS, prevention of abuse is recognised as a co-equal objective. Courts must consider both objectives when applying interpretive principles to provisions such as the Principal Purpose Test or beneficial ownership requirements.

## 6. Treaty Termination and Suspension

### 6.1. Overview of Termination Provisions

The VCLT provisions on treaty termination and suspension have become increasingly exam-relevant, particularly following geopolitical developments affecting the DTC network. *(covered in June 2024)*

Article 54 addresses termination or withdrawal in conformity with treaty provisions or by consent of all parties. Most DTCs contain termination clauses permitting denunciation with notice—typically six months to one year before the end of a calendar year.

### 6.2. Material Breach (Article 60)

Article 60 addresses termination or suspension as a consequence of breach. A material breach of a bilateral treaty by one party entitles the other to invoke the breach as ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part.

A material breach is defined as a repudiation of the treaty not sanctioned by the VCLT, or violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the treaty's object or purpose. For DTCs, questions arise whether failure to exchange information or refusal to honour treaty benefits constitutes material breach.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict has tested these provisions. Following Russia's suspension of DTC provisions with certain states in 2022-2023, affected states questioned whether the suspensions complied with VCLT requirements. Russia cited Article 60 and alleged material breach through suspension of information exchange, though this characterisation has been disputed.

### 6.3. Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Article 62)

Article 62 addresses the doctrine of rebus sic stantibus—fundamental change of circumstances. A party may invoke fundamental change as ground for termination or withdrawal only if the changed circumstances were unforeseen, constituted an essential basis for consent to be bound, and radically transform the extent of remaining obligations.

This ground is interpreted restrictively. Economic changes alone rarely satisfy the threshold. For DTCs, fundamental changes in the tax system or economic relationship between states might potentially qualify, but the high threshold makes successful invocation difficult.

### 6.4. Other Grounds and Procedural Requirements

Article 61 addresses supervening impossibility of performance—where permanent disappearance or destruction of an object indispensable for treaty execution makes performance impossible. Article 63 provides that severance of diplomatic relations does not itself affect treaty obligations unless diplomatic relations are indispensable for treaty application. Article 64 addresses emergence of new peremptory norms (jus cogens) that render conflicting treaties void.

Article 65 establishes procedural requirements. A state invoking invalidity, termination, withdrawal, or suspension must notify the other party. If no objection is raised within three months, the notifying state may proceed. If objection is raised, parties must seek resolution through means indicated in Article 33 of the UN Charter.

## 7. Key Case Law on VCLT Application

### 7.1. Fothergill v Monarch Airlines (UK, 1981)

The House of Lords decision in Fothergill v Monarch Airlines [1981] AC 251 is the leading UK authority on VCLT application. The case concerned interpretation of the Warsaw Convention on international air carriage but established principles applicable to all treaty interpretation.

The House of Lords confirmed that VCLT principles govern treaty interpretation in English courts. The decision endorsed recourse to travaux préparatoires as a supplementary means and emphasised that treaties should be interpreted to give effect to the common intention of states rather than through technical domestic rules. The court applied a purposive, internationally consistent construction aligned with VCLT principles.

### 7.2. United States v Stuart (US, 1989)

In United States v Stuart, 489 U.S. 353 (1989), the Supreme Court addressed interpretation of the US-Canada tax treaty. The Court applied the good faith standard, holding that tax treaties must be liberally interpreted with a view to achieving their underlying purpose.

The majority drew support from Senate pre-ratification debate, negotiating materials, and past practice of the treaty parties. Justice Scalia, concurring, argued vigorously that separation of powers concerns should restrict inquiry to the four corners of the agreement. Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice O'Connor, expressed the view that resort to extrinsic materials should be reserved for cases where treaty language does not yield a clear answer.

### 7.3. Thiel v FCT (Australia, 1990)

The High Court of Australia in Thiel v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) established foundational authority for the status of OECD Commentary under the VCLT. The case concerned the Australia-Switzerland DTC.

Justice McHugh, with majority concurrence, approved recourse to the OECD Model and Commentaries as supplementary means under Article 32 VCLT. These documents form the basis for bilateral agreements and provide a guide to current usage of terms by parties. Justice Dawson went further, suggesting the Commentaries might also qualify under Article 31 as context, though acknowledging doubts about this characterisation for bilateral treaties.

### 7.4. Alta Energy (Canada, 2021)

The Supreme Court of Canada in Canada v Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L. (2021 SCC 49) applied VCLT principles to the Canada-Luxembourg treaty. The majority started with ordinary meaning of treaty text and considered object and purpose—both elimination of double taxation and facilitation of trade.

The Court held that interpreters cannot read requirements into treaty text that the parties did not include. Post-treaty Commentary updates are not determinative where they would effectively amend the parties' original agreement. The decision reinforced the primacy of Article 31 materials over subsequent developments.

## 8. The MLI Explanatory Statement and VCLT

### 8.1. Contested Legal Status

The legal status of the MLI Explanatory Statement under the VCLT framework has generated significant academic and professional debate. The Explanatory Statement accompanies the MLI and states that it "reflects the agreed understanding of the negotiators." However, it is not part of the MLI text itself. *(covered in June 2024)*

### 8.2. Possible Classifications

Several VCLT classifications have been proposed. Under Article 31(2)(a), the Explanatory Statement might qualify as an agreement relating to the treaty made between parties in connection with its conclusion. This classification would give it binding force for members of the ad hoc group that negotiated the MLI. Under Article 31(2)(b), it might constitute an instrument made by parties and accepted by others as related to the treaty, potentially binding on MLI signatories who freely adopted the instrument.

Under Article 31(4), the Explanatory Statement might establish special meanings intended by the parties for particular terms. Under Article 32, it would qualify as a supplementary means of interpretation—persuasive but not binding.

### 8.3. BEPS Reports and the VCLT

The 2015 BEPS Final Reports influenced the OECD Model 2017 but were not attached to the Model itself. Their VCLT status differs from the Explanatory Statement. The BEPS Reports do not constitute context under Article 31(2) because they were not made in connection with the conclusion of any specific DTC. They may potentially qualify as supplementary means under Article 32. Their influence is primarily exercised through incorporation into the OECD Commentary.

The relationship between BEPS materials, the MLI, the Explanatory Statement, and underlying treaties creates a complex web of interpretive sources that courts must navigate when applying modified treaty provisions.
