# Chapter 19.4: Definition of Permanent Establishments in the Digital Economy

## 1. Introduction: The Digital PE Challenge

### 1.1. The Physical Presence Paradox

The permanent establishment concept, designed for an economy where businesses required physical premises to serve foreign markets, faces fundamental tension when applied to digital business models. Article 5 of the OECD Model establishes PE through a fixed place of business through which an enterprise wholly or partly carries on its business. Digital enterprises generate substantial revenue across jurisdictions while maintaining minimal physical infrastructure—streaming services, social media platforms, and cloud computing providers operate globally without fixed premises in most market jurisdictions.

This physical presence paradox creates asymmetry between economic activity and taxable presence. Enterprises derive significant value from markets where they have no PE, placing those revenues beyond source-country taxation under traditional treaty rules. The challenge is not merely that digital businesses avoid PE through deliberate structuring, but that their fundamental business models operate without requiring the physical infrastructure that triggers PE status.

### 1.2. Traditional Definition Limitations

The three cumulative requirements for PE—place of business, geographic and temporal fixity, and business conducted through that place—assume physical operations that digital businesses simply do not need. A software company can serve millions of customers through servers located anywhere, with customer support provided remotely, and transactions processed automatically. None of these activities necessarily creates PE under traditional definitions, regardless of the revenue generated or value created in market jurisdictions.

Understanding how Article 5 applies to digital businesses requires examining each definitional element and its interaction with modern technology infrastructure and business practices.

## 2. Article 5 Basic Requirements in Digital Context

### 2.1. Place of Business: Physical Infrastructure

The place of business requirement demands tangible property at a specific location. OECD Commentary confirms that premises, facilities, and installations constitute places of business if at the enterprise's disposal for business purposes. For digital businesses, this analysis centres on technical infrastructure—servers, data centres, network equipment—rather than traditional office premises.

The "at disposal" concept proves critical. An enterprise has a location at its disposal when that location is continuously available for its business activities, regardless of formal ownership. Leased server capacity may satisfy this requirement if the enterprise controls the equipment's use. Conversely, purchasing cloud computing services from a third-party provider typically does not create PE because the provider, not the customer, controls the physical infrastructure.

This distinction drives practical structuring decisions. Digital businesses routinely use hosting arrangements, cloud services, and content delivery networks specifically structured so that third-party providers maintain operational control, preventing PE attribution to the enterprise using those services.

### 2.2. Fixity in Digital Operations

Geographic fixity requires a link between the place of business and a specific geographic point. For servers and data centres, this poses no conceptual difficulty—physical equipment occupies identifiable locations. However, virtualised infrastructure and multi-jurisdictional cloud services complicate the analysis. Where computing processes occur across distributed infrastructure without fixed geographic allocation, identifying the "place" of business becomes challenging.

Temporal fixity requires sufficient permanence—typically six months or more, though shorter periods may suffice for recurring activities. Digital infrastructure often exceeds this threshold easily, as servers operate continuously for extended periods. The temporal element rarely defeats PE claims for established digital operations; the challenge lies elsewhere in the definitional requirements.

### 2.3. Business Conducted Through Place

The requirement that business be conducted through the place of business distinguishes mere asset ownership from PE creation. An enterprise owning servers performs no business through them if those servers merely store dormant data. Business activity requires that the servers actively contribute to the enterprise's commercial operations—processing transactions, delivering services, generating revenue (covered in December 2024).

For automated digital operations, this analysis becomes nuanced. Servers processing customer orders, streaming content, or providing cloud computing services clearly conduct business. The absence of human personnel at the server location does not preclude PE status—automated equipment can conduct business if it performs functions essential to the enterprise's commercial activities.

## 3. Server and Technical Infrastructure

### 3.1. When Servers Constitute PE

OECD Commentary paragraphs 42.1 through 42.10 specifically address electronic commerce and PE. The Commentary confirms that a server—physical equipment with a specific location—can constitute PE if the enterprise has it at its disposal and business is conducted through it. This applies whether the server is owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the enterprise.

Several conditions must be satisfied. The server must be located at a fixed place for sufficient duration. The enterprise must have the server at its disposal, meaning it controls its use rather than merely purchasing services from the operator. Business must actually be conducted through the server—not merely data storage but active commercial functions.

Where these conditions are met, even fully automated operations may create PE. A server automatically processing orders, accepting payments, and arranging delivery conducts business without human intervention. The Commentary recognises that personnel presence is not required where equipment performs essential business functions.

### 3.2. Website Distinction

The Commentary draws a critical distinction between servers and websites. A website—software and data—lacks physical presence and cannot itself constitute PE. Websites are intangible, residing on servers but having no independent physical existence. This distinction matters significantly: an enterprise's website accessible worldwide creates no PE regardless of where customers access it.

However, the server hosting the website may constitute PE under the analysis above. The website software performs functions, but the server provides the physical presence potentially satisfying Article 5 requirements. This creates planning opportunities—enterprises can host websites on servers they do not control, avoiding both website and server PE.

Online storefronts illustrate the distinction. An e-commerce website accessible to customers in a jurisdiction creates no PE through the website itself. If the enterprise owns or controls the servers hosting that website and those servers are located in the jurisdiction, PE may arise through the server, not the website.

### 3.3. Cloud Infrastructure and Data Centres

Cloud computing introduces additional complexity. Infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service arrangements involve physical servers, but typically the cloud provider—not the customer—controls that infrastructure. Customers purchase computing capacity without having servers at their disposal.

This structure generally prevents PE creation for cloud service customers. The customer uses virtualised resources allocated dynamically across the provider's infrastructure, without controlling any specific physical equipment. Even where customer workloads run on identifiable servers, the cloud provider's operational control typically prevents attribution to the customer.

Cloud providers themselves face different analysis. Their data centres, housing servers they own and operate, may constitute PE in host jurisdictions. Major cloud providers structure operations recognising this exposure, establishing local subsidiaries or arranging their affairs to manage PE consequences. Content delivery networks similarly involve physical edge servers across multiple jurisdictions, each potentially creating PE for the network operator.

## 4. Preparatory and Auxiliary Exception

### 4.1. Digital Warehousing and Fulfillment

Article 5(4) exempts from PE status fixed places of business used solely for preparatory or auxiliary activities. The provision lists specific examples: storage, display, delivery of goods, purchasing, and information collection. Digital commerce frequently involves these activities—warehouses storing goods for online orders, fulfillment centres packaging and dispatching purchases, data collection through online interactions.

The 2017 BEPS Action 7 reforms fundamentally altered this analysis. Previously, enterprises could claim exemptions simply by conducting listed activities, without demonstrating preparatory or auxiliary character. The revised Article 5(4) requires that all activities, including those specifically listed, satisfy the preparatory or auxiliary standard. An enterprise cannot claim that warehousing is exempt merely because Article 5(4)(a) mentions storage—the warehousing must genuinely be preparatory or auxiliary to the enterprise's business.

For digital commerce, this reform matters significantly. A large-scale fulfillment centre processing thousands of daily orders may constitute the core of an e-commerce operation, not preparatory activity. The exemption applies where warehousing supports a business conducted elsewhere, not where warehousing and distribution represent the primary value-creating activities in a jurisdiction (covered in June 2024).

### 4.2. Anti-Fragmentation Rules

Article 5(4.1), introduced through BEPS Action 7, prevents artificial fragmentation of business activities to exploit the preparatory or auxiliary exception. Enterprises previously structured operations with separate facilities for storage, delivery, and customer service—each claiming exemption individually while collectively constituting substantial business presence.

The anti-fragmentation rule provides that the exception does not apply where the enterprise or a connected enterprise conducts business activities at the same or another place in the jurisdiction, and either that place constitutes PE or the overall activity resulting from combination is not preparatory or auxiliary. This aggregate assessment prevents the sum of individually exempt activities from escaping PE status through artificial separation.

Digital commerce structures face particular scrutiny under this rule. An online retailer with separate warehousing, packaging, delivery coordination, and returns processing facilities must assess whether combined activities remain preparatory or auxiliary. Where these facilities collectively represent the retailer's core distribution capability in a jurisdiction, PE may arise despite each facility individually conducting activities listed in Article 5(4).

MLI Article 13 implements this reform, though adoption varies. Approximately ninety-four jurisdictions have signed the MLI, but not all have opted into the anti-fragmentation provisions. Treaty partners must both adopt the provision for it to apply to their bilateral relationship, creating asymmetric application across the treaty network.

## 5. Agency PE in Digital Commerce

### 5.1. Commissionnaire Arrangements

Digital businesses commonly used commissionnaire arrangements to avoid PE. A commissionnaire concludes contracts in its own name but on behalf of a principal—receiving goods from the principal, selling to local customers, and remitting proceeds minus commission. Legally, the commissionnaire, not the principal, binds itself to customers. Under traditional treaty interpretation, the principal had no PE because the commissionnaire had no authority to conclude contracts in the principal's name.

BEPS Action 7 addressed this structure through revised Article 5(5). The provision now creates PE where a person habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principal role leading to contract conclusion, where those contracts are in the name of the enterprise, for transfer of property or provision of services by the enterprise, or for granting rights to use the enterprise's property or services. The phrase "principal role leading to contract conclusion" specifically targets commissionnaire-type arrangements (covered in December 2023).

This reform captures digital sales structures where local affiliates negotiate transactions, manage customer relationships, and arrange terms—even where the affiliate technically contracts in its own name or contracts are formally concluded elsewhere. The focus shifts from formal contract-signing authority to substantive role in achieving contract conclusion.

### 5.2. Digital Intermediaries

Digital platforms often use intermediaries to facilitate transactions without directly contracting with customers. Marketplace operators connect buyers and sellers. Affiliate networks drive customers to merchant websites. Payment processors handle transactions on merchants' behalf. Each relationship raises questions about whether the intermediary creates PE for the principal.

The revised agency PE rules apply where intermediaries habitually play principal roles in contract conclusion. A local affiliate routinely negotiating terms, addressing customer concerns, and facilitating agreement—with the principal merely approving transactions without material modification—may create PE despite formal contracting occurring elsewhere.

The independent agent exception in Article 5(6) provides protection where the agent acts independently and in the ordinary course of business. However, this exception was narrowed to exclude agents acting exclusively or almost exclusively for closely related enterprises. Captive intermediaries—local affiliates serving only their parent or group companies—cannot claim independent agent status regardless of how their relationships are formally structured.

## 6. 2025 OECD Model Update: Remote Work

### 6.1. 50% Working Time Threshold

The November 2025 OECD Model update introduced significant guidance on home office PE, responding to pandemic-driven increases in remote work. New Commentary paragraphs 44.1 through 44.21 establish a framework for analysing when employee home offices create PE for employers.

The framework introduces a quantitative threshold: where an individual works from a home location for less than fifty percent of total working time over a twelve-month period, that location generally does not constitute a place of business. This provides practical certainty for common arrangements—occasional remote work, hybrid schedules, and temporary relocations below the threshold create no PE concern.

Where home office use exceeds fifty percent, further analysis is required. The threshold is not automatically determinative; exceeding it triggers consideration of additional factors rather than creating presumptive PE. The analysis considers whether the location has sufficient permanence and whether the enterprise has it at its disposal—factors that require assessment even for home locations heavily used for work.

### 6.2. Commercial Reason Test

For locations exceeding the fifty percent threshold, the 2025 update introduces a commercial reason test. Even significant home office use does not create PE if the enterprise lacks a commercial reason for the employee's presence in that location. Commercial reasons include direct engagement with local customers or suppliers, access to jurisdiction-specific resources or expertise, or substitution for premises the enterprise would otherwise rent.

Employee preference does not constitute commercial reason. Remote work arrangements driven by work-life balance considerations, talent attraction strategies, or employee convenience—without commercial necessity for the specific location—do not create PE regardless of the time spent. Similarly, cost reduction through avoiding office rent does not establish commercial reason.

This distinction matters for digital businesses with distributed workforces. A software developer working remotely for personal convenience creates no PE even if working exclusively from home in a foreign jurisdiction. A sales representative stationed in a territory to serve local customers may create PE through that home office because commercial reason—customer proximity—explains the location.

The preparatory or auxiliary exception applies to home offices as to other locations. Internal administrative functions—accounting, human resources, secretarial duties—frequently satisfy this exception even where other requirements for PE are met. The 2025 Commentary acknowledges that home office activities often fall within preparatory or auxiliary categories.

## 7. UN Model Alternatives

### 7.1. Services PE (183-Day Threshold)

The UN Model provides broader PE definitions reflecting developing country interests in source taxation. Article 5(3)(b) establishes services PE where an enterprise furnishes services through employees or other personnel present for more than one hundred eighty-three days in any twelve-month period. This provision requires no fixed place of business—service delivery duration alone triggers PE status.

For digital service providers, this provision captures consulting, implementation, and support activities conducted through personnel visiting client sites. A technology company sending implementation teams to client locations faces PE exposure where cumulative presence exceeds the threshold, regardless of whether it maintains any fixed facilities in the jurisdiction.

The provision applies cumulatively across related projects, preventing fragmentation to avoid the threshold. An enterprise cannot send rotating personnel for sequential short-term assignments, keeping each individual below one hundred eighty-three days, if the combined service delivery for connected projects exceeds that period.

### 7.2. Lower PE Thresholds

UN Model thresholds are generally lower than OECD equivalents, reflecting developing country priorities. Construction PE arises after six months under the UN Model versus twelve months under the OECD Model. The shorter threshold captures more projects, generating tax revenue from construction activities that would escape taxation under OECD standards.

The 2025 UN Model introduced Article 5A establishing thirty-day thresholds for natural resource extraction and renewable energy activities. This provision ensures source-country taxation of resource activities even for short-term operations, recognising the importance of natural resources in developing country economies.

These lower thresholds do not specifically target digital businesses but reflect the broader principle that source countries should capture taxable nexus more readily than OECD standards provide. Developing countries negotiating treaties may prefer UN Model provisions precisely because they address perceived inadequacies in OECD approaches to all business activities, including digital.

## 8. Jurisdictional Variations

### 8.1. UK Non-Concurrence

The United Kingdom maintains explicit non-concurrence with OECD Commentary provisions on server PE. HMRC's position holds that servers alone cannot constitute PE for enterprises conducting e-commerce through websites on those servers. The UK requires human intervention for PE—persons working in the business must work from the location for it to constitute PE.

This position creates jurisdictional divergence. An enterprise operating servers in the UK would not face PE claims from UK tax authorities based solely on server presence, even where the same servers might create PE exposure under OECD-aligned jurisdictions' interpretations. Enterprises structuring global operations must consider these variations when locating technical infrastructure.

The UK position reflects scepticism about taxing rights arising from fully automated operations without human presence. Whether this approach will persist as digital commerce evolves remains uncertain, but currently it provides significant planning opportunity for server location decisions.

### 8.2. Developing Country Approaches

Developing countries have adopted various approaches to digital PE, often exceeding OECD and UN Model provisions. India's significant economic presence concept, though not technically PE, creates business connection triggering taxation based on transaction values or user numbers rather than physical presence. This represents legislative response to perceived PE definition inadequacy.

Several jurisdictions have reserved against OECD Commentary interpretations or added domestic law provisions expanding PE concepts. These variations create compliance complexity for multinational digital enterprises—the same operational structure may create PE exposure in some jurisdictions while avoiding it in others based on local interpretations and domestic law modifications.

The asymmetry between treaty PE definitions and domestic law PE concepts creates additional complexity. Treaties may limit source-country taxation to situations meeting treaty PE thresholds, but domestic law may assert broader jurisdiction that treaties constrain. Understanding both layers is essential for digital business tax planning.

## 9. Digital PE Adequacy Assessment

The traditional PE definition inadequately addresses digital business models. Enterprises generating substantial revenue from jurisdictions where they maintain no physical infrastructure face no PE exposure under Article 5 as currently structured. The definitional requirements—fixed place, at disposal, business conducted through—presume physical operations that digital businesses can avoid without artificial structuring.

BEPS Action 7 reforms addressed certain avoidance techniques but did not fundamentally alter the physical presence requirement. Anti-fragmentation rules prevent exploitation of preparatory or auxiliary exceptions. Agency PE reforms capture commissionnaire arrangements. But enterprises operating through third-party infrastructure, remote workforces, and automated systems can still legitimately avoid PE under reformed rules.

This inadequacy drove development of alternative nexus concepts—significant economic presence, market-based nexus under Pillar One Amount A, and automated digital services taxation under UN Article 12B. These alternatives recognise that PE reform cannot fully address digital economy challenges while maintaining physical presence as the fundamental nexus criterion. Whether these alternatives will supplement or eventually replace traditional PE remains to be determined as international tax architecture continues evolving.
