## Chapter 10.6: Students – Article 20, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

### 1. Introduction and Overview

#### 1.1. Purpose and Function of Article 20

Article 20 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC) and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention (MDTC) provides a host state exemption for certain payments received by students and business apprentices. Unlike other distributive articles that allocate taxing rights between states, Article 20 operates differently—it prohibits the host state from taxing specified payments, leaving the residence state free to tax or exempt under its domestic law.

The provision does not positively allocate taxing rights to either state. Instead, it creates a unilateral restriction on the host state, ensuring that students pursuing education abroad are not subjected to taxation by the country where they study. This structural difference reflects the article's specific policy objectives.

#### 1.2. Policy Rationale

Several interconnected policy considerations underpin Article 20's special treatment for students. The primary purpose is educational promotion—encouraging international education and training by removing tax barriers to student mobility and facilitating cultural and academic exchange. States have long recognised that taxing students on their maintenance payments would impede the free movement of scholars across borders.

A second consideration is protecting the home state's investment. When a state sponsors students through grants or scholarships, it expects those funds to benefit the student's education rather than being diverted into the host state's treasury. As noted in the Commentary, the purpose is to ensure that "the generosity of governments or public bodies towards students of their own State" is not captured by foreign tax authorities. *(covered in June 2025)*

Administrative simplicity also supports the exemption. Students typically have limited means, often barely sufficient for living expenses, and requiring them to navigate complex host state tax compliance would create disproportionate burdens. Since student stays are inherently temporary, the administrative cost of taxing such transient populations may exceed the revenue generated.

Finally, considerations of fairness apply. Maintenance payments are designed to cover basic living costs during education, and taxing these amounts would create genuine hardship. Students are not economically exploiting the host state—they are acquiring education that they will typically take back to their home countries.

#### 1.3. Historical Development

Article 20 has existed in substantially its current form since the OECD Model was first published in 1963. The original 1963 Draft Convention used the word "formerly" to describe the student's prior residence status. The 1977 revision amended this to "immediately before visiting," tightening the temporal requirement and preventing abuse by individuals who had only remote historical connections to the other Contracting State.

This evolution reflects the ongoing tension in international tax treaty policy between facilitating genuine educational exchange and preventing abuse. The 1977 change addressed concerns that the original "formerly" language was too loose—an individual who had been resident in a state many years earlier could theoretically claim Article 20 benefits despite having no current meaningful connection to that state.

#### 1.4. Unique Nature of Article 20

Article 20 operates distinctively from other OECD Model provisions. It is not a taxing rights allocation—it does not say who can tax, only that the host state cannot tax qualifying payments. The home state may or may not tax under its domestic law, and this outcome is the intended design rather than a drafting oversight.

Residence is not determinative for Article 20's operation. The article works regardless of whether the student becomes a resident of the host state during their studies. The critical factor is that the individual was a resident of the other Contracting State immediately before visiting—subsequent changes in residence during the educational period do not automatically disqualify the exemption.

Importantly, Article 20 may result in double non-taxation, and this is an accepted consequence. Where the host state is prohibited from taxing and the home state exempts the payments under domestic law, neither state taxes the income. This outcome is considered acceptable because the policy goal of supporting education outweighs revenue concerns.

### 2. The Text of Article 20

#### 2.1. OECD Model Article 20

Article 20 of the OECD MTC 2017 provides: "Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of his education or training receives for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State."

This single sentence provision contains multiple cumulative conditions that must all be satisfied for the exemption to apply.

#### 2.2. Key Elements

The provision identifies specific categories of qualifying persons: "student or business apprentice." This personal scope limits Article 20 to individuals engaged in formal education or structured training programmes. Teachers, researchers, and visiting scholars are not covered unless they simultaneously hold student status.

The temporal requirement uses the phrase "is or was immediately before visiting." This creates two alternative timings—either the individual currently remains a resident of the home state throughout their studies, or they were a resident immediately before departing for the host state. The phrase "immediately before" requires close temporal connection, with no intervening period of residence in a third country.

The presence requirement specifies "solely for the purpose of his education or training." This sole purpose test examines why the individual is present in the host state. The predominant reason must be education or training, though ancillary activities do not automatically disqualify the exemption.

Qualifying payments must be "for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training." This covers living expenses, tuition fees, course materials, and training costs. The purpose of the payment, not its form, determines whether Article 20 applies.

The final and often decisive condition is that payments must "arise from sources outside that State." Host state source payments fall outside Article 20 regardless of whether all other conditions are satisfied.

### 3. Detailed Analysis of Key Conditions

#### 3.1. Personal Scope: Student or Business Apprentice

The personal scope covers university students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, vocational training students, PhD candidates, students on exchange programmes, and individuals pursuing professional qualifications. Business apprentices include those engaged in practical training arrangements connected to commercial or trade activities.

Persons not expressly covered include teachers (unless they also hold student status), independent researchers, and visiting scholars who are not enrolled in educational programmes. Some bilateral treaties extend Article 20 to include these categories or provide separate provisions for them.

The UN Model uses slightly different terminology—"student, apprentice or business trainee"—which may provide marginally broader coverage by separating traditional craft apprenticeships from broader business training contexts.

#### 3.2. The Temporal Requirement: Immediately Before Visiting

The phrase "is or was immediately before visiting a resident of the other Contracting State" creates two alternative timings that provide flexibility. Under the first alternative, the student retains residence of the home state throughout their educational period—they "is" a resident of the other state at the time of receiving payments.

Under the second alternative, the student "was immediately before visiting" a resident of the home state but may have lost that residence upon departing. This recognises that moving abroad for extended education may terminate home state residence under domestic law, yet the student should not lose Article 20 protection merely because of this technical change in residence status.

The phrase "immediately before" requires temporal proximity to the visit. The student cannot have been resident in a third state between leaving the home state and arriving in the host state. This prevents abuse where individuals with no genuine connection to either Contracting State attempt to claim Article 20 benefits.

#### 3.3. The "Visiting" Requirement

The word "visiting" implies temporary presence rather than permanent settlement. This requirement has generated considerable interpretive debate, particularly when a student's circumstances change during their educational period. *(covered in June 2025)*

Article 20 does not specify a maximum time limit, unlike the US Model which includes specific year limits for students and trainees. The absence of a time limit means the duration question depends on facts and circumstances—specifically, whether the individual remains a "visitor" or has effectively settled in the host state.

Circumstances that may indicate the individual is no longer "visiting" include applying for permanent residence visas, moving in with a local partner or spouse, acquiring permanent accommodation, taking up permanent employment, making long-term plans to remain, and severing ties with the home state. In the Canadian case Qing Gang K. Li v The Queen (1994), Article 20 was held not to apply because the taxpayer was no longer a temporary visitor.

The timing of changed circumstances creates additional complexity. A student who begins their studies as a genuine visitor may later form intentions to remain permanently. The question arises whether such changed circumstances affect the treatment of payments received during the earlier period. The better view, supported by academic commentary, is that each year should be assessed on its own facts—Year 2 changes generally do not affect Year 1 treatment.

#### 3.4. Sole Purpose: Education or Training

The requirement that presence be "solely for the purpose of his education or training" examines the individual's predominant reason for being in the host state. This does not require absolute exclusivity—students may engage in ancillary activities without losing Article 20 protection.

Commentary paragraph 2.1 confirms that students may derive additional payments from employment or independent activities, and this does not automatically deny Article 20 treatment for their maintenance payments. Employment and independent income are considered separately under their applicable articles. A student working part-time to supplement their maintenance grant does not forfeit Article 20 benefits for the grant itself.

However, where the sole or predominant purpose of presence becomes the performance of economic activities rather than education, Article 20 may cease to apply. A full-time employee who studies part-time is present primarily for employment, not education, and would not qualify. The distinction turns on which purpose is predominant, not merely whether economic activities occur.

#### 3.5. Qualifying Payments

Three categories of payments qualify: maintenance, education, and training. Maintenance covers living expenses including accommodation, food, transport within the host state, and general subsistence grants. Education includes tuition fees, course materials, laboratory fees, examination costs, and academic scholarships. Training encompasses vocational training costs, professional qualification expenses, and apprenticeship stipends.

Commentary paragraph 3 confirms that Article 20 applies where payments are for "maintenance or education." The form of payment is irrelevant—whether monthly stipends, lump sums, or direct payments to educational institutions, the payment qualifies if made for qualifying purposes.

#### 3.6. The Source Condition

The requirement that payments "arise from sources outside that State" is often the decisive condition. Payments from the home state or third countries fall within Article 20 if other conditions are satisfied. Payments sourced within the host state cannot qualify regardless of how perfectly the other conditions are met. *(covered in June 2025)*

This source condition reflects the policy rationale—Article 20 protects the generosity of home states sponsoring their students abroad. It does not require the host state to exempt payments that it would otherwise have full economic connection to tax.

In practical application, a maintenance grant from a home state charity satisfies the source condition, while a research payment from a host state foundation fails this condition and must be analysed under other articles—typically Article 21 (Other Income) or Article 15 (Employment Income) depending on the payment's character.

### 4. Interaction with Other Articles

#### 4.1. Article 20 and Article 21

When Article 20 does not apply—whether because the source condition fails or other requirements are not satisfied—the payment may fall under Article 21 (Other Income). Under OECD Article 21, income not covered by other articles is taxable only in the residence state.

A research payment sourced within the host state cannot benefit from Article 20. If the payment is for maintenance or education purposes rather than employment services, it may constitute "other income" under Article 21, taxable in the student's residence state at the time of payment. If the student was still resident in the home state during Year 1, the home state has taxing rights. If the student has become resident in the host state by Year 2, the host state may tax as the new residence state.

#### 4.2. Article 20 and Article 15

The boundary between Article 20 and Article 15 arises when students receive payments that could be characterised as either maintenance or employment income. The character of the payment determines which article applies: payments for services rendered fall within Article 15 as employment income, while payments for maintenance purposes without service obligations fall within Article 20 if other conditions are satisfied.

Some taxpayers have attempted to characterise employment income as student payments to access Article 20's host state exemption. Tax authorities and courts have resisted such recharacterisation, requiring that the substance of the payment relationship be examined rather than its label.

Where a student receives a research stipend, the analysis turns on whether the payment is for services under a contract with deliverables (Article 15) or for maintenance and education without specific obligations (potentially Article 20, subject to the source condition). The presence of a formal employment contract, specified deliverables, or direction and control over the work suggests employment income treatment.

#### 4.3. Saving Clause Exception

Article 20 is excepted from the saving clause in Article 1(3) of the OECD MTC 2017. This exception prevents the host state from invoking the saving clause to override Article 20's exemption.

If a student becomes a resident of the host state under domestic law during their studies, the host state might otherwise argue that the saving clause permits it to tax its residents regardless of treaty provisions. The Article 20 exception to the saving clause preserves the exemption, ensuring that students who acquire host state residence do not lose the protection that Article 20 was designed to provide.

### 5. UN Model Comparison

The UN Model Tax Convention Article 20 is substantially similar to the OECD Model. The primary textual difference is terminology—the UN uses "student, apprentice or business trainee" rather than the OECD's "student or business apprentice." This may provide slightly broader coverage by separating traditional craft apprenticeships from broader business training contexts.

All other key elements are identical: the "immediately before visiting" temporal requirement, the "solely for education or training" purpose requirement, the "maintenance, education or training" payment scope, and the "sources outside that State" condition. The effect is the same—the host state cannot tax qualifying payments.

This consistency between the OECD and UN Models reflects broad international consensus that special treatment for students serves educational and cultural exchange objectives shared by developed and developing countries alike.

### 6. Double Non-Taxation Consequence

Article 20 may result in double non-taxation, and this is an accepted consequence of the provision's design. Where the host state is prohibited from taxing under Article 20 and the home state exempts the payments under its domestic law (as many countries do for educational grants), neither state taxes the income.

Academic commentary acknowledges this outcome without criticism. The policy goal of supporting international education outweighs revenue concerns. Students typically have limited means, maintenance payments often barely cover living costs, and the educational benefit to both states—and to international understanding generally—justifies accepting some revenue loss.

### 7. Practical Application

The most common application involves students receiving maintenance grants from home state sources while studying abroad. Where all conditions are satisfied—student status, prior residence, sole educational purpose, maintenance character, and external source—the host state must exempt the payments. The home state retains discretion under domestic law whether to tax or exempt.

Changed circumstances during extended studies create more complex analysis. A student who begins their programme as a genuine visitor may, through relationship formation or permanent visa applications, cease to qualify as "visiting" in subsequent years. The temporal question is whether this change affects treatment of payments received before the change occurred. The better view is that each period should be assessed on its own facts.

Research payments and stipends from host state sources require analysis under other articles. Regardless of how closely connected to education these payments may be, the source condition excludes them from Article 20. The payment's character then determines whether Article 15 or Article 21 applies, with residence at the time of payment determining which state may tax. *(covered in June 2025)*

### 8. Emerging Issues

#### 8.1. Digital and Remote Education

The growth of online education programmes raises questions about Article 20's application when physical presence in the host state is limited or absent. A student enrolled in an institution located in one country but studying remotely from another may not be "visiting" the institution's state in any meaningful sense. Under traditional interpretation, Article 20 requires the student to be "present in" the host state—remote study may not satisfy this physical presence requirement.

This interpretation limits Article 20's scope in the digital education era. A student receiving a maintenance grant from their home state while studying online for a foreign institution is not "visiting" that institution's state and thus does not need Article 20 protection from that state's taxation. The payments remain subject to home state domestic law without treaty implications.

#### 8.2. Extended Doctoral Programmes

Extended doctoral programmes that span many years create interpretive challenges. A PhD candidate studying for five or more years may struggle to maintain "visiting" status throughout their programme. The absence of a time limit in Article 20 does not mean that indefinite stays qualify—at some point, the student may effectively have settled permanently, negating the "visiting" requirement.

The practical approach in such cases often involves year-by-year analysis. A student who maintains genuine intentions to return home and does not take actions inconsistent with visitor status may continue to qualify even through extended programmes. Conversely, a student who after several years applies for permanent residence, acquires property, or forms permanent family connections may lose Article 20 protection for subsequent years.

#### 8.3. Multiple Programme Enrolments

Students who complete one programme and subsequently enrol in another face questions about whether Article 20 protection continues. The requirement that the student was resident in the other state "immediately before visiting" refers to the initial visit. A student who completed undergraduate studies and remained in the host state before commencing postgraduate studies may no longer satisfy this temporal requirement.

The better view is that each educational programme should be assessed independently. If the student returned to their home state between programmes, they may re-qualify for Article 20 upon commencing the new programme. If they remained continuously in the host state, the original "immediately before visiting" requirement was satisfied once and continues to operate—but the "visiting" requirement must still be satisfied, which becomes increasingly difficult as the stay extends.
