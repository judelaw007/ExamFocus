# Chapter 14.2: Abuse of Law Doctrines and DTCs

## 1. Introduction and Conceptual Framework

### 1.1. Relationship Between Domestic Law and Treaties

The relationship between domestic anti-avoidance doctrines and tax treaty obligations presents one of the most contentious issues in international taxation. While Chapter 14.1 examined treaty-based mechanisms such as the Principal Purpose Test and Limitation on Benefits provisions, this chapter addresses domestic abuse of law doctrines and their interaction with treaty protections. The fundamental question is whether and when domestic anti-avoidance rules can override benefits that a treaty ostensibly grants.

Tax treaties operate as international agreements between sovereign states, creating rights and obligations that bind the contracting parties. Under the principle of pacta sunt servanda enshrined in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, treaties must be performed in good faith. This creates tension when domestic anti-avoidance doctrines would deny benefits that treaty language appears to confer.

### 1.2. Abuse of Law Distinguished from Treaty Shopping

Abuse of law doctrines differ conceptually from treaty shopping addressed by PPT and LOB provisions. Treaty shopping concerns whether a person is entitled to claim treaty benefits in the first instance—a threshold question of treaty access. Abuse of law doctrines concern whether arrangements that technically satisfy treaty requirements should nonetheless be disregarded because they lack genuine substance or economic purpose.

The distinction matters practically. Treaty-based anti-abuse provisions operate within the treaty framework itself, forming part of the agreed allocation of taxing rights. Domestic abuse of law doctrines operate outside the treaty, potentially overriding treaty protections through unilateral application of source state law. This raises questions about treaty override and the limits of domestic anti-avoidance jurisdiction.

## 2. Civil Law Doctrines

### 2.1. Fraus Legis and Abuse of Right

Civil law jurisdictions developed abuse of law doctrines centuries before modern tax treaties existed. The doctrine of fraus legis—literally "fraud upon the law"—holds that legal arrangements designed solely to circumvent legal prohibitions while technically complying with legal forms should be disregarded. The related concept of abuse of right provides that rights must be exercised in accordance with their purpose; exercise contrary to that purpose constitutes abuse.

These doctrines translate into tax contexts as general anti-avoidance principles. An arrangement that achieves a tax result inconsistent with the purpose of tax provisions may be recharacterised or disregarded, even if it satisfies the literal requirements of those provisions. The focus is on whether the arrangement serves any purpose beyond obtaining tax benefits that the legislation did not intend to confer.

### 2.2. Netherlands and German Approaches

The Netherlands has historically applied fraus legis in tax matters through judicial development. Dutch courts examine whether arrangements lack reasonable business purpose other than tax avoidance and whether they frustrate the purpose of tax legislation. The doctrine requires identifying a specific legislative purpose that the arrangement circumvents—general tax minimisation does not suffice. The Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) has developed nuanced tests balancing taxpayer freedom to structure affairs efficiently against purposive limits on that freedom.

Germany applies similar principles through its general anti-avoidance rule in Section 42 of the Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung). This provision addresses arrangements that constitute an abuse of legal structuring possibilities. An abuse exists where an inappropriate legal structure is chosen that provides a tax advantage not intended by legislation, and the taxpayer cannot demonstrate valid non-tax reasons for the structure. The Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) has applied these principles stringently, requiring genuine economic substance beyond tax benefits.

## 3. Common Law Doctrines

### 3.1. Substance Over Form

Common law jurisdictions developed their own anti-avoidance principles through judicial decision-making rather than codified general principles. The substance over form doctrine provides that tax consequences follow the true nature of transactions rather than their formal characterisation. Where substance and form diverge, courts may recharacterise transactions according to their economic reality.

The doctrine originated in the United States with Gregory v Helvering (1935), where the Supreme Court held that a corporate reorganisation structured to access preferential tax treatment would be disregarded because it served no business purpose other than tax avoidance. Justice Learned Hand's famous formulation that taxpayers may arrange their affairs to minimise taxes but must accept the tax consequences of what they actually do established the framework for subsequent development.

The UK developed parallel principles through cases including IRC v Duke of Westminster (1936), which initially emphasised taxpayer freedom to structure affairs tax-efficiently, and subsequent cases that qualified that freedom. The Ramsay principle, established in WT Ramsay Ltd v IRC (1982), held that composite transactions with inserted steps having no commercial purpose apart from tax avoidance should be viewed as single transactions for tax purposes.

### 3.2. Economic Substance Doctrine

The economic substance doctrine, predominantly a US development, requires that transactions have meaningful economic effects apart from tax benefits. A transaction lacking economic substance—one that does not meaningfully change the taxpayer's economic position in any way apart from obtaining tax benefits—may be disregarded for tax purposes.

The doctrine comprises two prongs: an objective inquiry into whether the transaction produced a reasonable expectation of pre-tax profit, and a subjective inquiry into whether the taxpayer had a business purpose for entering the transaction. US courts have applied these prongs both conjunctively and disjunctively depending on circuit, though the Seventh Circuit's formulation requiring both prongs has gained widespread acceptance.

Congress codified the economic substance doctrine in Section 7701(o) of the Internal Revenue Code in 2010. The codification requires that transactions satisfy both prongs—producing meaningful change in economic position apart from tax effects and having substantial purpose apart from tax effects—to be respected for tax purposes (covered in December 2024).

### 3.3. Business Purpose Test

The business purpose test examines whether transactions were motivated by genuine commercial objectives beyond tax benefits. While related to economic substance, the business purpose test focuses specifically on taxpayer intent rather than objective economic effects. A transaction entered solely to obtain tax benefits, with no independent business motivation, may be recharacterised or disregarded.

The test originated in Gregory v Helvering and has been applied across common law jurisdictions. The UK's Furniss v Dawson (1984) applied similar reasoning, holding that steps inserted into transactions solely for tax purposes could be disregarded. However, subsequent UK cases including Craven v White (1989) qualified this approach, requiring that the tax-motivated steps be pre-ordained parts of composite transactions rather than merely contingent.

## 4. General Anti-Avoidance Rules and Treaties

### 4.1. GAAR Principles

General Anti-Avoidance Rules codify anti-avoidance principles in statutory form, providing explicit authority to deny tax benefits from arrangements that abuse tax legislation. GAARs typically contain three elements: identification of an arrangement that produces a tax benefit; determination that the arrangement constitutes abuse or misuse of tax provisions; and recharacterisation or adjustment to deny the abusive benefit.

The hallmark of modern GAARs is their focus on purpose and effect rather than mere form. An arrangement is abusive if it achieves results inconsistent with the purpose of the provisions relied upon, even if it technically complies with those provisions. This purposive approach requires identifying the object, spirit, and purpose of relevant tax rules and determining whether the arrangement frustrates that purpose.

### 4.2. Can Domestic GAAR Override Treaty Benefits?

The question whether domestic GAAR can override treaty benefits divides jurisdictions and commentators. Three principal positions have emerged. The first holds that treaties as international obligations take precedence over domestic law, preventing unilateral denial of treaty benefits through domestic anti-avoidance rules. The second holds that GAAR provisions represent the state's interpretation of its own tax legislation, which treaties incorporate by reference through provisions like Article 3(2) of the OECD Model. The third holds that treaties themselves contemplate anti-abuse application, making GAAR consistent with rather than contradictory to treaty obligations.

The OECD Commentary has evolved on this question. The 2003 revisions introduced guidance suggesting that domestic anti-avoidance rules do not conflict with treaty provisions because treaties should not be interpreted as facilitating abuse. This position was controversial and prompted observations from several countries, including Luxembourg, which expressly disagreed. The Canada Supreme Court in Alta Energy Luxembourg (2021) declined to apply the 2003 Commentary revisions to a treaty predating those revisions, emphasising that subsequent Commentary cannot modify treaty obligations agreed before its adoption (covered in June 2024).

### 4.3. Country Approaches

India has adopted an assertive position on GAAR-treaty interaction. Section 96A of the Income Tax Act, introduced in 2017, explicitly provides that GAAR applies to arrangements regardless of treaty benefits. The provision reflects India's view that treaties should not shelter abusive arrangements and that source countries retain inherent authority to apply anti-avoidance principles. However, Indian courts have required that GAAR application meet strict procedural and substantive thresholds, preventing casual override of treaty protections.

Canada's position shifted following Alta Energy. While the Canada Revenue Agency had previously argued that GAAR could deny treaty benefits in appropriate cases, the Supreme Court's emphasis on the static interpretation of treaty obligations and the significance of Luxembourg's observation disagreeing with the 2003 Commentary introduced uncertainty. The decision suggests that GAAR application to deny treaty benefits requires careful consideration of whether such application was contemplated when the treaty was concluded.

The UK introduced its statutory GAAR in 2013, applicable to arrangements entered into from July 2013. The UK GAAR contains explicit double-reasonableness tests and requires GAAR Panel approval before application. UK guidance acknowledges uncertainty regarding GAAR-treaty interaction but suggests that GAAR may apply where arrangements abuse treaty provisions alongside domestic legislation.

## 5. Treaty Interpretation Framework

### 5.1. Vienna Convention Principles

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides the interpretive framework for tax treaties under international law. Article 31 establishes the general rule of interpretation: treaties shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of terms in their context and in the light of their object and purpose. Context includes the treaty text, preamble, and any agreements or instruments made in connection with the treaty.

Article 32 addresses supplementary means of interpretation, including preparatory work and circumstances of conclusion. These supplementary means may be used to confirm meaning derived from Article 31 application or to determine meaning when Article 31 interpretation leaves meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to manifestly absurd or unreasonable results.

The status of OECD Commentary within this framework remains debated. The Commentary does not fit neatly into Vienna Convention categories—it is neither the treaty text nor preparatory work in the traditional sense. Courts have generally treated the Commentary as a supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32, though its weight depends on timing relative to treaty conclusion and whether it clarifies or modifies prior understanding.

### 5.2. Static vs Ambulatory Interpretation

The static versus ambulatory interpretation debate concerns whether treaties should be interpreted by reference to OECD Commentary existing when the treaty was concluded (static) or the Commentary as it currently stands (ambulatory). The choice has significant implications for abuse of law analysis, as the 2003 and subsequent Commentary revisions substantially expanded guidance on anti-avoidance application.

The UK generally follows an ambulatory approach. In Smallwood, the court observed that it would be unwise to shut one's eyes to developments in the international tax arena. The UK Supreme Court in Fowler v HMRC (2020) confirmed that post-treaty Commentary may inform interpretation, though the weight given to later Commentary depends on circumstances.

Germany follows a static approach. The Bundesfinanzhof in December 2023 held that Commentary not existing when a treaty entered force cannot be relied upon for interpretation. This decision contradicted German tax authority guidance favouring ambulatory interpretation and reinforced Germany's commitment to static principles (covered in December 2023).

Canada adopted a predominantly static approach in Alta Energy. The Supreme Court held that Commentaries postdating a treaty cannot introduce terms modifying the treaty. Later Commentaries may assist interpretation only if they expand upon or clarify concepts already found in earlier applicable Commentary without extending scope in ways unanticipated by drafters.

## 6. Key Case Law

### 6.1. UK Cases

The Ramsay principle established that transactions comprising pre-ordained steps with no commercial purpose apart from tax avoidance should be viewed as single transactions. In WT Ramsay Ltd v IRC, inserted circular payments designed to create allowable losses were disregarded. The House of Lords held that fiscal legislation should not be interpreted to exempt from tax profits arising from transactions with no purpose other than tax avoidance.

Furniss v Dawson extended Ramsay to stamp out inserted steps in a series of transactions. Lord Brightman formulated the principle that where steps are inserted having no commercial purpose other than avoidance of tax liability, those steps should be disregarded. However, Craven v White subsequently limited this principle, requiring that inserted steps be genuinely pre-ordained rather than merely planned or anticipated.

The Danish beneficial ownership cases, decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2019, addressed conduit arrangements through Danish companies. The Court held that the prohibition of abuse of rights is a general principle of EU law applicable regardless of whether there is a domestic law basis. This principle allows member states to deny treaty benefits where arrangements lack genuine economic activity and serve primarily to obtain those benefits (covered in June 2023).

### 6.2. US Cases

Gregory v Helvering remains the foundational US authority on substance over form and business purpose. The taxpayer created a corporation solely to receive appreciated securities, then liquidated it to recognise capital gains rather than ordinary dividends. The Supreme Court held that the transaction would be disregarded because it was a mere device lacking business or corporate purpose.

Aiken Industries (1971) addressed conduit arrangements in the treaty context. A US company routed interest payments through a Honduran subsidiary to access the US-Honduras treaty's interest exemption, though the interest was immediately passed to a Bahamian parent with whom the US had no treaty. The Tax Court denied treaty benefits, holding that the Honduran company was a mere conduit without genuine business purpose for the interest flows.

Coltec Industries (2006) applied the codified economic substance doctrine to contingent liability transactions. The Court of Appeals held that transactions lacking economic substance apart from tax benefits could be disregarded even absent explicit statutory authority, as the doctrine represents inherent judicial power to interpret tax legislation.

### 6.3. EU Cases

Halifax (2006) established that EU law prohibits abusive practices in tax matters. The CJEU held that VAT benefits must be denied where transactions have as their essential aim obtaining a tax advantage and would contravene the purpose of VAT provisions. This abuse test requires both an objective element (obtaining advantages contrary to purpose) and a subjective element (essential aim of tax advantage).

Cadbury Schweppes (2006) addressed CFC legislation and freedom of establishment. The Court held that arrangements may be disregarded only if they constitute "wholly artificial arrangements" not reflecting economic reality. Where a subsidiary conducts genuine economic activities, anti-avoidance rules cannot apply regardless of tax motivation for establishing the subsidiary. This genuine economic activity test has influenced both EU and non-EU approaches to anti-avoidance.

## 7. ATAD and EU Developments

The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive established mandatory anti-abuse rules across EU member states. Article 6 requires member states to ignore arrangements or series of arrangements that, having been put into place for the main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage defeating the object or purpose of applicable tax law, are not genuine having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances. An arrangement is not genuine to the extent it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons reflecting economic reality.

ATAD II extended anti-avoidance measures to hybrid mismatches involving third countries. ATAD III, expected from January 2026, introduces minimum substance requirements for entities claiming tax benefits. The three-part gateway test identifies entities with predominantly passive income, primarily cross-border transactions, and outsourced management activities. Such entities must demonstrate minimum substance indicators—own premises, active bank accounts, and qualified decision-making personnel—or face denial of tax residence certificates.

## 8. Recent Developments

The 2025 OECD Model update maintained existing anti-abuse Commentary while introducing additional guidance on specific issues including remote working and natural resources. The Sixth Peer Review Report on Treaty Shopping, published November 2025, confirmed that over 1,120 agreements between Inclusive Framework members now comply with minimum anti-abuse standards through PPT or LOB provisions.

The withdrawal of the United States from the OECD Inclusive Framework in January 2025 introduced uncertainty regarding future multilateral anti-abuse developments. While the US maintains its traditional LOB approach in bilateral treaties, its departure from Inclusive Framework processes may affect coordination on anti-abuse interpretation and implementation.

India's CBDT Circular 1/2025 clarified that the Principal Purpose Test applies prospectively, with shares acquired before April 2017 grandfathered from PPT scrutiny. This guidance addresses interaction between treaty-based anti-abuse (PPT) and domestic anti-abuse (GAAR), suggesting that earlier domestic anti-avoidance principles may apply to arrangements predating PPT introduction while PPT governs subsequent transactions.
