## Chapter 6.5: BEPS Action 5 - Harmful Tax Practices

### 1. Introduction to Harmful Tax Practices

Tax competition between jurisdictions is a normal feature of international taxation, with countries adjusting their tax systems to attract investment and economic activity. However, certain forms of tax competition cross the line from legitimate competition to harmful practices that erode the tax bases of other countries without providing commensurate economic benefits. Harmful tax practices typically involve preferential regimes that attract highly mobile business activities or income through tax advantages unavailable to domestic activities, often without requiring genuine economic substance in the jurisdiction offering the benefits.

The distinction between acceptable and harmful tax competition lies not in low tax rates themselves but in features that artificially divert profits from jurisdictions where genuine economic activities occur. A jurisdiction with uniformly low tax rates applied to all activities is exercising its sovereign right to set tax policy, while a jurisdiction offering special low rates only to foreign-owned activities or mobile income is engaged in practices that systematically erode other countries' tax bases while providing minimal economic benefit domestically.

BEPS Action 5 addresses harmful tax practices through two complementary mechanisms: assessing preferential tax regimes to identify and modify harmful features, and establishing transparency requirements for tax rulings that could facilitate profit shifting. As one of the four BEPS minimum standards, Action 5 requires all Inclusive Framework members to implement its provisions and participate in peer review monitoring. This mandatory status reflects the recognition that effective action against harmful tax practices requires coordinated international commitment rather than voluntary adoption.

### 2. Historical Context: The 1998 Report and FHTP Origins

#### 2.1. The 1998 Report on Harmful Tax Competition

The OECD's engagement with harmful tax competition predates the BEPS Project by nearly two decades. In 1998, the OECD published the landmark report "Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue," which established the conceptual framework for distinguishing between acceptable and harmful tax competition. This report responded to concerns that globalisation was enabling increasingly sophisticated structures for shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions, undermining the tax bases of countries where economic activities actually occurred.

The 1998 report identified key factors indicating potentially harmful tax practices. These included no or low effective tax rates on the relevant income, ring-fencing of regimes from the domestic economy, lack of transparency in the operation of the regime, and absence of effective exchange of information with other jurisdictions. For tax havens specifically, the report also emphasised the absence of requirements for substantial activities as an indicator of harmful practices.

The report led to the establishment of the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices within the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs. The FHTP was tasked with monitoring the implementation of the report's recommendations, reviewing member countries' potentially harmful preferential regimes, and engaging with non-member jurisdictions to address harmful practices globally.

#### 2.2. Evolution of the FHTP's Work

The FHTP's early work focused on identifying and addressing preferential regimes in OECD member countries and engaging with jurisdictions identified as tax havens. While progress was made in addressing some harmful regimes, the substantial activities requirement received limited attention in practice despite its inclusion in the 1998 framework. The FHTP's work also faced challenges in achieving global participation, as many jurisdictions outside the OECD had limited incentive to modify their tax regimes.

The BEPS Project reinvigorated and expanded the FHTP's mandate. Action 5 elevated the substantial activities requirement from a largely dormant criterion to a central feature of the assessment framework. The establishment of the Inclusive Framework in 2016 dramatically expanded participation in the FHTP's work, bringing over 140 jurisdictions into the process of assessing and addressing harmful tax practices on an equal footing. *(covered in December 2023)*

### 3. The BEPS Action 5 Framework

#### 3.1. Core Elements

BEPS Action 5 focuses on countering harmful tax practices more effectively, with particular emphasis on improving transparency. The action establishes a minimum standard with two main components: the assessment of preferential tax regimes to ensure they do not facilitate base erosion and profit shifting, and a transparency framework requiring spontaneous exchange of information on certain tax rulings.

The work of the FHTP under Action 5 comprises three key areas. First, the assessment of preferential tax regimes to identify features that can facilitate BEPS, applying criteria that determine whether a regime is harmful, potentially harmful, or not harmful. Second, peer review and monitoring of the transparency framework requiring compulsory spontaneous exchange of relevant information on taxpayer-specific rulings. Third, review of substantial activities requirements in jurisdictions with no or only nominal taxation to ensure they meet agreed international standards.

#### 3.2. Assessment Criteria for Preferential Regimes

The FHTP applies a set of criteria to assess whether preferential tax regimes are harmful. The primary factors include whether the regime offers a preferential rate compared to the general rate of taxation, whether it is ring-fenced from the domestic economy, and whether it lacks transparency or effective exchange of information. Additional factors examine whether the jurisdiction requires substantial activities for taxpayers benefiting from the regime and whether the tax base determination rules depart from international standards.

A regime may be classified as harmful, potentially harmful but not actually harmful, in the process of being eliminated, not harmful, or out of scope. Potentially harmful regimes are those that meet the technical criteria for harm but have not been used in practice to facilitate BEPS, while regimes actively facilitating profit shifting are classified as actually harmful and require modification or abolition.

### 4. Preferential Regimes and the Nexus Approach

#### 4.1. Intellectual Property Regimes

Intellectual property regimes, commonly known as patent boxes or innovation boxes, have received particular scrutiny under Action 5. These regimes provide reduced tax rates on income derived from intellectual property, intended to encourage research and development activities within the jurisdiction. However, without appropriate safeguards, IP regimes can facilitate profit shifting by allowing income from IP developed elsewhere to benefit from preferential rates.

The concern with IP regimes is that taxpayers could develop intellectual property through research activities in one jurisdiction, transfer the resulting IP to an entity in a jurisdiction offering preferential rates for IP income, and thereby shift profits from the jurisdiction where development actually occurred. This arrangement provides tax benefits without corresponding economic substance in the jurisdiction granting the preference.

#### 4.2. The Modified Nexus Approach

To address these concerns, the FHTP developed the modified nexus approach, which conditions access to IP regime benefits on the taxpayer having undertaken qualifying research and development activities generating the IP income. Under this approach, the proportion of IP income eligible for preferential treatment is determined by the ratio of qualifying expenditure to total expenditure on the development of the IP asset.

Qualifying expenditure includes costs directly incurred by the taxpayer for research and development activities, as well as costs incurred for R&D activities outsourced to unrelated parties. Expenditure on R&D outsourced to related parties or on acquisition of IP assets does not qualify. This formula ensures that preferential treatment is available only to the extent that the taxpayer itself has performed genuine development activities, preventing arrangements where IP is merely acquired or developed through related party outsourcing and parked in the preferential regime jurisdiction.

The modified nexus approach permits a limited uplift of up to 30 percent on qualifying expenditure to account for situations where some related party outsourcing or acquisition expenditure relates to genuinely qualifying activities. This uplift cannot exceed the amount of non-qualifying expenditure, preventing manipulation while providing flexibility for legitimate arrangements. *(covered in June 2023)*

#### 4.3. Implementation of the Nexus Approach

Major jurisdictions with IP regimes have amended their provisions to comply with the nexus approach. France modified its reduced corporation tax rate on IP income to incorporate nexus requirements. Belgium restructured its innovation income deduction to align with the substantial activities standard. The Netherlands amended its innovation box regime, and Luxembourg abolished its partial exemption for intellectual property rights that did not meet nexus requirements.

The FHTP has assessed hundreds of IP regimes globally, with the majority being modified to comply with the nexus approach or abolished where compliance was not achievable. Regimes that do not incorporate adequate nexus requirements are classified as harmful and must be eliminated or brought into compliance.

### 5. The Transparency Framework

#### 5.1. Spontaneous Exchange of Tax Rulings

The second element of the Action 5 minimum standard establishes a framework for compulsory spontaneous exchange of information on certain tax rulings that could give rise to BEPS concerns in the absence of such exchange. This transparency mechanism ensures that tax administrations in affected jurisdictions have access to information about rulings that might indicate profit shifting or other BEPS arrangements involving their residents or activities in their jurisdiction.

The framework covers several categories of rulings. These include rulings related to preferential regimes covered by the FHTP's work, cross-border unilateral advance pricing agreements and other transfer pricing rulings, rulings giving a downward adjustment to profits in the ruling jurisdiction, rulings on the characterisation or absence of permanent establishment, and rulings involving conduit arrangements that channel income to residents of other jurisdictions.

#### 5.2. Exchange Mechanism and Coverage

Rulings within scope must be spontaneously exchanged with jurisdictions that have a potential interest in the arrangement. For preferential regime rulings, exchange is required with the jurisdiction of the immediate parent company and the ultimate parent company. For transfer pricing rulings, exchange is required with jurisdictions of related parties to the covered transaction. The framework specifies minimum information requirements to ensure receiving jurisdictions have sufficient detail to assess BEPS risks.

The transparency framework has generated substantial information flows between tax administrations. As of recent peer reviews, over 58,000 exchanges of information have occurred on more than 26,000 tax rulings identified under the framework. This represents a significant enhancement in tax administration transparency compared to the pre-BEPS environment where such rulings were generally confidential to the ruling jurisdiction and the taxpayer.

#### 5.3. Peer Review of the Transparency Framework

Implementation of the transparency framework is monitored through annual peer reviews conducted by the FHTP. The peer review process examines whether jurisdictions have established legal frameworks for exchanging rulings, whether they have effective processes for identifying rulings within scope, and whether exchanges are actually occurring in practice. Jurisdictions are assessed against the terms of reference and receive recommendations for improvement where deficiencies are identified.

The peer reviews have driven substantial improvements in transparency practices globally. The majority of Inclusive Framework jurisdictions are now assessed as fully compliant with the transparency framework, with ongoing monitoring to ensure continued compliance. Jurisdictions with recommendations for improvement are expected to address identified deficiencies and demonstrate compliance in subsequent reviews.

### 6. Substantial Activities Requirements

#### 6.1. No or Nominal Tax Jurisdictions

Jurisdictions with no or only nominal taxation present particular challenges for the harmful tax practices framework. Without a meaningful corporate tax system, these jurisdictions cannot apply the preferential regime assessment criteria that compare regime rates to general rates. However, such jurisdictions can nonetheless facilitate profit shifting if they permit entities to accumulate income without genuine economic activities.

Action 5 addresses this through requirements that jurisdictions with no or only nominal taxation must impose substantial activities standards on entities benefiting from their tax system. These standards require that income-generating activities be directed and managed in the jurisdiction, that adequate numbers of qualified employees are present and operating in the jurisdiction, that adequate operating expenditure is incurred in the jurisdiction, and that physical premises are maintained in the jurisdiction.

#### 6.2. Implementation and Monitoring

The FHTP has identified twelve jurisdictions as having no or only nominal taxation and has conducted reviews of their substantial activities frameworks. All twelve jurisdictions have implemented domestic legislation establishing substantial activities requirements, bringing their frameworks into line with the international standard. Annual monitoring examines whether these requirements are being effectively applied in practice.

The substantial activities requirements complement the anti-profit shifting measures in other BEPS actions by ensuring that even jurisdictions without corporate taxation cannot serve as destinations for artificial profit shifting arrangements. Entities in these jurisdictions must demonstrate genuine economic presence proportionate to the income they earn, preventing the use of shell companies or arrangements with minimal substance.

### 7. Current Status and Statistics

#### 7.1. Regime Reviews

Since the commencement of the BEPS Project, the FHTP has reviewed over 330 preferential tax regimes across Inclusive Framework jurisdictions. Over 40 percent of these regimes have been abolished or are in the process of being abolished, demonstrating the substantial impact of the Action 5 framework in eliminating harmful practices. The majority of remaining regimes have been found not harmful after assessment against the criteria or have been modified to eliminate harmful features.

Only a small number of regimes currently remain classified as harmful, with affected jurisdictions working to bring these into compliance. The peer review process maintains pressure on jurisdictions to address harmful features, with the FHTP publishing regular updates on regime status and highlighting jurisdictions where further action is required.

#### 7.2. Transparency Statistics

The transparency framework has generated extensive information exchange between tax administrations. The volume of exchanges continues to grow as jurisdictions identify additional rulings within scope and refine their processes for systematic exchange. Peer reviews consistently find high levels of compliance with the framework requirements among major jurisdictions, with targeted recommendations for improvement where gaps are identified.

Recent peer reviews have assessed over 140 jurisdictions against the transparency framework requirements. The substantial majority are in compliance or have received only minor recommendations for improvement. The effectiveness review completed by the Inclusive Framework has resulted in refinements to the peer review methodology to ensure continued relevance as jurisdictions achieve mature compliance.

### 8. Relationship with Other BEPS Actions

#### 8.1. Interaction with Minimum Standards

Action 5 operates alongside the other three BEPS minimum standards to provide comprehensive protection against base erosion and profit shifting. Action 6 addresses treaty abuse, ensuring that tax treaties are not exploited to achieve unintended benefits. Action 13 establishes country-by-country reporting, providing tax administrations with comprehensive information on multinational enterprise operations. Action 14 improves dispute resolution mechanisms to address conflicts arising from BEPS measures.

These minimum standards reinforce each other. Information exchanged under the Action 5 transparency framework may reveal arrangements that warrant scrutiny under other BEPS measures. Country-by-country reporting data can identify jurisdictions where profits appear disconnected from activities, potentially indicating use of harmful preferential regimes. Effective dispute resolution ensures that aggressive application of anti-BEPS measures does not result in unrelieved double taxation.

#### 8.2. Relationship with Pillar Two

The introduction of the global minimum tax under Pillar Two has implications for harmful tax practices. The 15 percent minimum effective tax rate established by Pillar Two reduces the benefit available from preferential regimes, potentially diminishing the incentive for jurisdictions to maintain harmful practices. Where a preferential regime results in an effective tax rate below 15 percent, top-up tax under Pillar Two would capture the difference, eliminating the competitive advantage of the preferential rate.

However, Action 5 remains relevant even in a Pillar Two environment. Not all multinational enterprises meet the Pillar Two threshold, leaving smaller groups subject only to Action 5 constraints. The transparency framework continues to provide valuable information flows regardless of minimum taxation. The substantial activities requirements in no or nominal tax jurisdictions address concerns beyond tax rate differentials. Accordingly, Action 5 and Pillar Two operate as complementary rather than substitutive measures.

### 9. Challenges and Future Developments

#### 9.1. Implementation Challenges

Effective implementation of Action 5 faces several ongoing challenges. Ensuring consistent application of assessment criteria across diverse tax systems requires careful judgment, and borderline cases may be assessed differently by different reviewers. The substantial activities requirements in no or nominal tax jurisdictions require ongoing monitoring to ensure they are applied effectively rather than merely existing on paper. Resource constraints in developing country tax administrations may limit their capacity to participate fully in the transparency framework.

Political and economic interests also create challenges. Jurisdictions that have historically benefited from preferential regimes may resist changes that eliminate these advantages. Tax advisory firms and multinational enterprises may advocate for interpretations that preserve planning opportunities. Balancing the elimination of harmful practices against legitimate policy objectives such as encouraging innovation requires careful calibration of the framework's requirements.

#### 9.2. Evolving Tax Landscape

The FHTP's work must continue to evolve in response to changing business practices and tax planning techniques. Digital business models may create new opportunities for profit shifting that existing frameworks do not adequately address. Emerging preferential regimes must be assessed promptly to prevent harmful practices from becoming established. The interaction between Action 5 and new developments such as Pillar Two requires ongoing coordination to ensure coherent outcomes.

The FHTP has demonstrated adaptability in responding to new challenges, expanding its scope from the original 1998 framework to address contemporary BEPS concerns. Continued vigilance and willingness to modify the framework as circumstances change will be essential for maintaining its effectiveness against harmful tax practices. The broad participation achieved through the Inclusive Framework provides a strong foundation for coordinated action, but sustaining political commitment to implementation remains critical.

### 10. Practical Implications

Multinational enterprises must assess their use of preferential regimes against Action 5 criteria to ensure continued compliance. Regimes benefiting IP income should be evaluated against nexus approach requirements, with documentation demonstrating that qualifying R&D activities support the income receiving preferential treatment. Enterprises should anticipate that tax rulings may be exchanged with other jurisdictions and ensure that their arrangements can withstand scrutiny by multiple tax administrations.

Tax advisors must stay current with FHTP assessments of preferential regimes, recognising that regime status may change as jurisdictions modify their provisions or the FHTP refines its assessments. Planning strategies that depend on preferential regimes should incorporate contingencies for potential regime modifications or elimination. The transparency framework means that arrangements involving multiple jurisdictions will increasingly be visible to all relevant tax administrations, requiring robust substance and documentation to support intended tax outcomes.
