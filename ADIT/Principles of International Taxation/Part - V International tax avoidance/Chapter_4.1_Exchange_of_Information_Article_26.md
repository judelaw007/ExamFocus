## Chapter 4.1: Exchange of Information – Article 26, OECD MTC and UN MDTC

The exchange of information between tax authorities represents one of the most significant developments in international tax cooperation. Article 26 of both the OECD Model Tax Convention and the UN Model Double Taxation Convention establishes the legal framework through which contracting states share tax-relevant information, enabling effective enforcement of domestic tax laws in an increasingly globalized economy.

### 1. Introduction to Article 26

#### 1.1. Purpose and Significance

Article 26 serves as a cornerstone of international tax cooperation by enabling tax authorities of contracting states to exchange information necessary for the proper administration and enforcement of their respective tax systems. In a world where capital moves freely across borders and multinational enterprises operate in multiple jurisdictions, domestic tax authorities face significant challenges in obtaining information about their taxpayers' foreign activities. Without effective mechanisms for cross-border information sharing, taxpayers could exploit information asymmetries to evade their tax obligations.

The provision addresses three fundamental objectives. First, it facilitates the carrying out of the provisions of the tax convention itself, ensuring that the treaty operates as intended. Second, it supports the administration of domestic tax laws concerning taxes of every kind and description. Third, it enhances the enforcement of these laws by providing access to information that would otherwise be unavailable to the requesting state.

#### 1.2. Historical Development

The exchange of information provision has evolved considerably over time. Early versions of the OECD Model contained a more limited exchange provision, reflecting the era's greater emphasis on taxpayer privacy and state sovereignty. The watershed moment came in 1977 when the OECD significantly expanded Article 26, recognizing the growing importance of information exchange in combating international tax evasion.

Prior to 2008, the OECD Model used the term "necessary" to describe the threshold for information that could be exchanged. This was replaced with "foreseeably relevant" to clarify that the standard should be interpreted broadly rather than restrictively. The change responded to concerns that some states were interpreting "necessary" too narrowly, frustrating the exchange mechanism's effectiveness.

The 2012 revision further enhanced the provision by explicitly addressing group requests, responding to concerns that the previous wording might not adequately cover requests concerning multiple taxpayers who could not be individually identified at the time of the request. This development was particularly significant in the context of investigations into offshore tax evasion schemes, where tax authorities often knew that a particular financial institution was being used for non-compliant purposes but could not identify specific account holders without assistance from the requested state.

### 2. Article 26(1): The Legal Foundation

#### 2.1. Scope of Information Exchange

Article 26(1) establishes the legal basis for exchanging information that is "foreseeably relevant" for carrying out the provisions of the convention or for the administration or enforcement of domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description. Importantly, the provision is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2 of the convention. This means that information may be exchanged even if it relates to persons who are not residents of either contracting state, or to taxes not covered by the convention itself.

This broad scope reflects the recognition that effective tax administration often requires information about non-residents or about taxes beyond those directly covered by the treaty. For example, a contracting state might request information about VAT transactions to verify the accuracy of an income tax return, even though VAT is not typically covered by income tax treaties.

#### 2.2. The "Foreseeably Relevant" Standard

The "foreseeably relevant" standard is the threshold that must be satisfied before a contracting state is obligated to provide information. The OECD Commentary explains that this standard is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent while preventing states from engaging in "fishing expeditions" or requesting information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer (covered in June 2024).

The standard requires that the information requested must have a reasonable possibility of being relevant to the tax affairs under investigation at the time of the request. Importantly, it is the reasonable expectation of relevance at the time of the request that matters, not whether the information ultimately proves to be relevant after it has been provided. The requesting state is not required to demonstrate with certainty that the information will be useful; rather, there must be a reasonable basis for believing it could be.

Prior to the 2008 changes, the term "necessary" was used. The OECD Commentary takes the view that "foreseeably relevant" and "necessary" have similar meanings, with "necessary" being understood as "appropriate and helpful" rather than "essential." Some academic commentary suggests that "foreseeably relevant" is somewhat broader, but the practical difference may be limited.

#### 2.3. Fishing Expeditions and Group Requests

The prohibition against "fishing expeditions" is a critical limitation on the exchange of information obligation. A fishing expedition refers to a speculative request for information that has no apparent connection to an open inquiry or investigation. The requesting state must be able to demonstrate that the information sought relates to a specific tax purpose and that there is a genuine investigative basis for the request.

The 2012 revision of Article 26 and its Commentary addressed the question of "group requests" – requests concerning a group of taxpayers who cannot be individually identified. The Commentary now clarifies that such requests can meet the foreseeably relevant standard, provided they satisfy certain conditions. The requesting state must provide a detailed description of the group, the specific facts and circumstances that have led to the request, an explanation of the applicable law, and why there is reason to believe that the taxpayers in the group have not complied with that law.

The distinction between a legitimate group request and a fishing expedition depends on the specificity of the request and the basis for believing that the identified group has engaged in non-compliance. A request for information about all account holders at a particular bank would likely constitute a fishing expedition, whereas a request concerning account holders who engaged in a specific pattern of transactions indicative of tax evasion might qualify as a legitimate group request.

### 3. Forms of Exchange of Information

#### 3.1. Exchange on Request

Exchange on request is the most common form of information exchange and occurs when a tax authority of one contracting state requests specific information from the tax authority of another contracting state regarding a particular taxpayer or transaction. Before making such a request, the requesting state should generally have exhausted all reasonable domestic sources of information.

A proper request should identify the person under examination or investigation, specify the tax purpose for which the information is sought, describe the information requested with sufficient detail to enable the requested state to locate it, and explain why the information is believed to be held by the requested state or in the possession of persons within its jurisdiction.

#### 3.2. Automatic Exchange

Automatic exchange involves the systematic and regular transmission of predefined categories of taxpayer information without the need for a specific request. This form of exchange has become increasingly important with the development of the Common Reporting Standard, which requires participating jurisdictions to collect and automatically exchange financial account information on an annual basis.

Under automatic exchange arrangements, contracting states agree in advance on the types of information to be exchanged and the timing of these exchanges. Common categories include information about dividends, interest, royalties, and pensions received by residents of one state from sources in the other state.

#### 3.3. Spontaneous Exchange

Spontaneous exchange occurs when a contracting state, during the course of administering its own tax laws, discovers information that it believes may be relevant to another state's tax administration and voluntarily transmits that information without having received a request. This form of exchange is particularly valuable when one state uncovers evidence of potential tax non-compliance by a resident of another state during an audit or investigation.

The Commentary to Article 26 encourages states to engage in spontaneous exchange, recognizing that information discovered during routine tax administration can be invaluable to partner states in detecting and deterring tax evasion.

#### 3.4. Combined and Other Methods

In practice, states often utilize a combination of exchange methods to optimize their cooperation in tax matters. The choice of method depends on the nature of the information, the urgency of the request, and the administrative capacities of both states. Additionally, contracting states may engage in other forms of cooperation beyond traditional information exchange, including simultaneous tax examinations, where both states conduct coordinated audits of the same taxpayer, and industry-wide exchanges targeting sectors prone to particular tax risks.

The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes conducts peer reviews to assess jurisdictions' compliance with international standards for both exchange on request and automatic exchange. These reviews examine both the legal framework and practical implementation, ensuring that exchange mechanisms function effectively in practice.

### 4. Confidentiality and Purpose Limitations

#### 4.1. Article 26(2): Confidentiality Obligations

Article 26(2) establishes strict confidentiality requirements for information received through the exchange mechanism. Any information exchanged must be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of the receiving state. This requirement reflects the fundamental principle that taxpayers should not be disadvantaged by having their information shared internationally compared to having it remain within a single jurisdiction.

Disclosure of exchanged information is limited to persons or authorities directly involved in the assessment, collection, or enforcement of taxes, the prosecution or determination of appeals relating to taxes, or the oversight of the foregoing. The information may be disclosed in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions, but otherwise must be kept confidential.

#### 4.2. Permitted Disclosures

While the confidentiality obligations are strict, Article 26(2) recognizes certain necessary exceptions. Information may be disclosed to oversight bodies responsible for supervising tax administration and enforcement agencies. Additionally, information may be used for other purposes if such use is permitted under the laws of both contracting states and the competent authority of the supplying state authorizes such use.

A significant development in recent years has been the question of whether information exchanged under Article 26 may be shared with other government agencies, such as anti-money laundering authorities. This reflects the growing recognition of the connection between tax evasion and other financial crimes. The OECD Commentary now contemplates that information may be shared for non-tax purposes where both contracting states' laws permit such use and the competent authority of the supplying state authorizes it.

Breaches of confidentiality carry serious consequences. A state that fails to maintain the confidentiality of exchanged information may find its treaty partners unwilling to continue exchanging information, undermining the entire framework of international tax cooperation. In extreme cases, breaches could give rise to liability under domestic law or international claims.

### 5. Limitations on the Obligation to Exchange

#### 5.1. Article 26(3): Domestic Law and Sovereignty

Article 26(3) establishes important limitations on the obligation to provide information, reflecting the principle that international cooperation should not require states to act contrary to their fundamental legal principles. A contracting state is not obligated to carry out administrative measures that conflict with its own laws or administrative practices, or those of the other contracting state.

Furthermore, a state is not required to supply information that is not obtainable under its domestic laws or in the normal course of its administration, or under the laws or administration of the requesting state. This reciprocity principle ensures that neither state can demand from the other information-gathering powers that exceed its own capabilities.

#### 5.2. Protection of Sensitive Information

Article 26(3) also protects certain categories of sensitive information from compulsory disclosure. A contracting state may decline to provide information that would disclose any trade secret, business secret, industrial secret, commercial secret, or professional secret, or trade process. Similarly, information may be withheld if its disclosure would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).

The scope of these exceptions is interpreted narrowly to prevent them from frustrating the purposes of the exchange provision. Trade secrets and similar protections are intended to safeguard genuinely confidential commercial information, not to provide a blanket exemption for business information generally. The public policy exception is similarly limited to cases where disclosure would conflict with fundamental values of the requested state.

### 6. Enhanced Cooperation Provisions

#### 6.1. Article 26(4): Obligation Regardless of Domestic Interest

Article 26(4) addresses a specific limitation that previously hindered effective information exchange. Some states historically refused to provide information when they had no domestic tax interest in obtaining it. This paragraph eliminates that barrier by requiring a requested state to use its information-gathering measures to obtain the requested information even if it does not need that information for its own tax purposes.

This provision ensures that the exchange mechanism operates effectively regardless of whether the requested state has any direct interest in the information. The obligation is subject to the limitations in Article 26(3), so a state is not required to take measures beyond what its domestic law permits, but the lack of domestic interest is no longer a valid ground for refusal.

#### 6.2. Article 26(5): Override of Bank Secrecy

Article 26(5) represents one of the most significant developments in international tax transparency. It provides that a contracting state may not decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity, or because the information relates to ownership interests in a person.

This paragraph effectively overrides traditional banking secrecy laws for the purposes of information exchange under tax treaties. The global movement toward tax transparency, accelerated following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent G20 initiatives, has made the erosion of bank secrecy a cornerstone of international efforts to combat offshore tax evasion. States that previously maintained strict banking secrecy, including Switzerland, have accepted Article 26(5) in their treaty negotiations, fundamentally transforming the landscape of international tax information exchange.

### 7. UN Model Double Taxation Convention

#### 7.1. Additional Anti-Avoidance Language

Article 26 of the UN Model Double Taxation Convention is intended to be broader in several respects than its OECD counterpart. Most notably, the UN Model includes an additional sentence in paragraph 1 stating that "in particular, information shall be exchanged that would be helpful to a Contracting State in preventing avoidance or evasion of such taxes."

This additional language was considered useful by members of the UN Committee, particularly those from developing countries, to make explicit in the treaty text a point that was already implicit in the Commentary. It emphasizes the anti-avoidance and anti-evasion purpose of the exchange provision, potentially supporting a broader interpretation of the information that may be exchanged.

#### 7.2. Developing Country Considerations

The UN Model's Commentary reflects particular concern for the position of developing countries in the information exchange framework. It clarifies that a developed country may not refuse to provide information to a developing country on the ground that the developing country lacks comparable administrative capacity. Reciprocity is to be measured by reference to the overall effects of the treaty, not with respect to the effects of any single article.

This approach recognizes that strict reciprocity in information exchange could disadvantage developing countries, which may have less capacity to make and process information requests but may have a greater need for information to combat tax evasion by their residents using financial centers in developed countries (covered in June 2023).

### 8. Judicial Interpretation

#### 8.1. The Berlioz Investment Fund Case

The Berlioz Investment Fund case, decided by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Justice on 16 May 2017, represents a landmark ruling on the interpretation of the "foreseeably relevant" standard and the rights of taxpayers in the context of international information exchange.

The case arose when Luxembourg tax authorities, acting on a request from French tax authorities under the EU Mutual Assistance Directive, demanded information from Berlioz Investment Fund. Berlioz provided most of the requested information but refused to supply certain financial details, arguing that they were not "foreseeably relevant" to the French investigation. Luxembourg imposed a penalty of €250,000 (later reduced to €100,000) for the partial refusal.

The ECJ was asked to determine whether the person from whom information is requested has the right to challenge the foreseeable relevance of the request and, if so, what standard of judicial review applies.

#### 8.2. Implications for Taxpayer Rights

The Court confirmed that Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees the right to an effective remedy, applies in this context. A person subject to an information request is entitled to judicial review of the validity of that request, including whether the information sought satisfies the "foreseeably relevant" standard.

However, the Court held that this review is limited to verifying that the request is not "manifestly devoid of any foreseeable relevance." The requesting authority retains discretion to determine what information it requires, and the requested authority's review is confined to identifying requests that are clearly without legitimate basis. This approach balances the effective operation of the exchange mechanism with the protection of taxpayer rights.

The Berlioz judgment has significant implications beyond the EU context, as the "foreseeably relevant" standard in the Mutual Assistance Directive mirrors that in the OECD Model Convention. The case establishes that information holders have some right to challenge overbroad or baseless requests, even if that right is subject to a deferential standard of review.
