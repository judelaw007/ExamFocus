## Chapter 6.1: The OECD BEPS Project

### 1. Introduction to BEPS

Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity. These practices enable multinational enterprises to minimise their tax burdens by separating taxable income from the jurisdictions where the underlying economic activities take place. The OECD estimates that BEPS practices cost countries between $100 billion and $240 billion USD in lost tax revenue annually, representing 4 to 10 percent of global corporate income tax receipts. Developing countries, which rely more heavily on corporate income tax as a proportion of total tax revenue, are disproportionately affected.

### 2. Origins and Development

#### 2.1. The G20 Mandate

Concerns about aggressive tax planning by multinational enterprises reached the highest levels of political attention in 2012, when G20 leaders meeting in Mexico called upon the OECD to address the issue. Public controversies surrounding the tax affairs of major technology and consumer companies had highlighted how existing international tax rules, developed in an era of predominantly physical business activities, were struggling to address modern business structures and digital commerce. These high-profile cases demonstrated how multinational enterprises could structure their affairs to pay minimal taxes despite substantial economic presence in major markets.

#### 2.2. Timeline and Milestones

The OECD responded with unprecedented speed. In February 2013, it published an initial report identifying the key concerns, followed in July 2013 by the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which set out 15 specific actions to be addressed. G20 leaders approved this Action Plan at their September 2013 summit in St Petersburg. Work proceeded over the following two years, culminating in October 2015 with the publication of final reports on all 15 BEPS Actions. The Multilateral Instrument developed under Action 15 was agreed in November 2016 and entered into force in July 2018.

### 3. Structure of the BEPS Project

#### 3.1. The Three Pillars

The BEPS Project is organised around three fundamental objectives, each addressing a distinct dimension of the problem. Traditional international tax rules had evolved piecemeal, with individual countries designing systems to tax their own residents and attract inward investment, often without considering how these rules would interact across borders. The first pillar, coherence, addresses this fragmentation by ensuring domestic tax rules work together across borders without creating opportunities for double non-taxation. The second pillar, substance, seeks to ensure that taxing rights align with economic activity and value creation. The third pillar, transparency, aims to provide tax authorities with better information while giving businesses greater certainty about their tax obligations.

#### 3.2. Types of BEPS Measures

The 15 Actions produced different types of outputs. Four actions constitute minimum standards that all participating jurisdictions must implement, subject to peer review to ensure consistent application. Other actions produced best practice recommendations, common approaches to facilitate coordination, or analytical reports providing guidance without mandating specific rules. This tiered structure reflects the varying degrees of consensus achievable across diverse tax systems and policy priorities. *(covered in June 2023)*

### 4. The 15 BEPS Actions

The BEPS Action Plan addresses tax challenges across multiple dimensions of international taxation. The selection of these fifteen actions reflected empirical analysis of the most significant profit shifting techniques and the structural weaknesses in international tax rules that enabled them. Each action targets a specific vulnerability that multinational enterprises had exploited to achieve low effective tax rates.

Action 1 examined the tax challenges of the digital economy, identifying issues that would later be addressed through the separate Pillar One and Pillar Two initiatives. Actions 2 through 4 focus on coherence: Action 2 addresses hybrid mismatch arrangements that achieve double non-taxation through differences in entity or instrument characterisation; Action 3 provides recommendations for strengthening controlled foreign company rules; and Action 4 addresses excessive interest deductions used for base erosion.

Actions 5 through 10 address substance requirements. Action 5 counters harmful tax practices through enhanced transparency and substance requirements for preferential regimes. Action 6 prevents treaty abuse, particularly treaty shopping. Action 7 addresses artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status. Actions 8, 9, and 10 together revise transfer pricing rules to ensure profits from intangibles, risks, capital, and other high-risk transactions align with value creation.

Actions 11 through 14 enhance transparency. Action 11 establishes methodologies for measuring and monitoring BEPS. Action 12 provides recommendations on mandatory disclosure rules for aggressive tax planning. Action 13 requires country-by-country reporting by large multinational enterprises. Action 14 improves the effectiveness of dispute resolution mechanisms.

Action 15 developed the Multilateral Instrument, which enables jurisdictions to modify their bilateral tax treaties to implement treaty-related BEPS measures without renegotiating each agreement individually.

### 5. The Minimum Standards

Four BEPS Actions constitute minimum standards to which all members of the Inclusive Framework have committed. Action 5 requires transparency regarding tax rulings and ensures that preferential regimes for intellectual property and similar activities meet substance requirements through the nexus approach. Action 6 mandates that tax treaties include provisions to prevent treaty shopping and other forms of treaty abuse, whether through limitation-on-benefits clauses, a principal purpose test, or both. Action 13 establishes country-by-country reporting requirements for multinational enterprise groups with consolidated revenue of €750 million or more. Action 14 commits jurisdictions to resolve treaty-related disputes through mutual agreement procedures in a timely and effective manner. *(covered in June 2024)*

These four areas were designated minimum standards because inconsistent implementation would undermine their effectiveness. The peer review process monitors compliance and provides a mechanism for identifying and addressing implementation gaps.

### 6. The Inclusive Framework and Implementation

The success of the BEPS Project depends fundamentally on broad participation. If only a subset of countries implemented BEPS measures, profit shifting would simply relocate to non-participating jurisdictions, undermining the entire initiative. Recognising this reality, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS was established in June 2016 to provide a structure through which countries and jurisdictions beyond the original OECD and G20 membership can participate in the ongoing work. As of 2025, more than 145 jurisdictions have joined the Inclusive Framework, working on an equal footing to develop and implement BEPS measures.

Implementation has proceeded substantially since 2015. Over 115 jurisdictions have introduced country-by-country reporting legislation, with more than 3,300 bilateral exchange relationships established for sharing these reports. The Multilateral Instrument has been signed by 104 jurisdictions and has modified approximately 1,400 bilateral tax treaties to incorporate BEPS measures. The BEPS Project has also informed subsequent work on tax challenges arising from digitalisation, addressed through the Two-Pillar Solution agreed in October 2021.
