## Chapter 5.2: Regional Arrangements for Cooperation in Tax Administration

### 1. Introduction to Regional Arrangements

While the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters provides a global framework for tax cooperation, many countries also participate in regional arrangements that offer tailored solutions for administrative assistance within specific geographic areas. These regional frameworks address the particular needs, legal traditions, and development levels of their member states, often providing mechanisms that complement or extend beyond multilateral provisions.

Regional arrangements for tax cooperation take various forms, from formal legal instruments to cooperative networks focused on capacity building and knowledge sharing. The principal regional frameworks exist in Europe, Africa, the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Caribbean. Each reflects the economic integration objectives and administrative capabilities of its participating jurisdictions.

### 2. European Union: Directive on Administrative Cooperation

The European Union operates the most developed regional framework for tax administrative cooperation through its Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC). This framework applies to all EU Member States and has evolved significantly since its initial adoption, progressively expanding its scope to address emerging challenges in tax transparency.

#### 2.1. Scope and Evolution

The DAC establishes mandatory automatic exchange of information among EU tax authorities across multiple categories. The framework has been successively amended to address new areas: DAC7, which became operational in 2024, requires digital platform operators to report information about sellers using their platforms; DAC8, applying from 1 January 2026, extends reporting obligations to crypto-asset service providers; and DAC9, adopted in 2025, facilitates information exchange for the implementation of the global minimum corporate tax under Pillar Two.

#### 2.2. Key Features

The DAC provides for all forms of administrative assistance available under the multilateral Convention—exchange of information on request, automatic exchange, and spontaneous exchange—but often imposes more stringent requirements than the global standard. The framework also enables joint audits, whereby officials from multiple Member States may conduct coordinated examinations of taxpayers with cross-border activities. The EU framework operates alongside Member States' participation in the OECD/Council of Europe Convention, with DAC provisions frequently going beyond the minimum requirements of multilateral instruments. *(covered in June 2024)*

### 3. African Arrangements

#### 3.1. ATAF and the Agreement on Mutual Assistance

The African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF), established in 2012, serves as the principal platform for tax cooperation among African jurisdictions. ATAF currently comprises 40 member administrations from across all five African sub-regions and focuses on building institutional capacity, promoting peer learning, and advancing African perspectives in global tax debates.

Central to ATAF's cooperation framework is the Agreement on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters (AMATM), which entered into force in October 2012 and now has 36 member states as parties. The AMATM provides a legal basis for exchange of taxpayer information, joint audits, and assistance in recovering tax debts held abroad. The agreement aligns with international best practices while being specifically designed for the African context. Through various cooperation mechanisms, ATAF members have collectively recovered over $1.8 billion in tax revenue.

#### 3.2. Sub-Regional Initiatives

Within Africa, sub-regional bodies provide additional cooperation mechanisms. The West African Tax Administration Forum (WATAF) focuses on tax administration improvement within the ECOWAS region, working in partnership with ATAF to deliver capacity building and technical assistance tailored to West African needs.

### 4. Other Regional Arrangements

#### 4.1. Americas: CIAT

The Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations (CIAT), founded in 1967, is the oldest organisation of its kind, bringing together 42 member countries from the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. CIAT promotes international cooperation through exchange of experiences and information, technical assistance, training, and development of tools for effective tax administration. The organisation maintains a tax transparency database covering 48 countries and serves as a platform for addressing common challenges such as tax evasion, avoidance, and fraud.

More recently, the Regional Tax Cooperation Platform for Latin America and the Caribbean (PTLAC), established in 2024, brings together 16 countries to strengthen international tax cooperation across the region. In its first year, participating countries identified EUR 585 million in additional tax revenues through enhanced transparency measures.

#### 4.2. Asia-Pacific: SGATAR and PITAA

The Study Group on Asia-Pacific Tax Administration and Research (SGATAR), operating since 1970, provides an annual forum for senior tax administrators from 18 member jurisdictions across the Asia-Pacific region. SGATAR facilitates cooperation, knowledge sharing, and capacity building among its members, which include major economies such as Australia, China, Japan, and Korea, as well as developing jurisdictions.

The Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association (PITAA) serves the specific needs of Pacific island nations, with its secretariat hosted by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority since 2012. PITAA works in partnership with the Asian Development Bank and other international bodies to build tax administration capacity in the Pacific region.

#### 4.3. Caribbean and Nordic Arrangements

The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) operates a Double Taxation Agreement signed in 1994 that provides for relief from double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion among member states. This agreement is currently being updated to align with international standards for information exchange and dispute resolution. *(covered in June 2024)*

The Nordic Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, concluded among Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1972, holds historical significance as a predecessor to the broader OECD/Council of Europe Convention. The Nordic arrangement continues to operate for specific purposes such as assistance in collection of tax debts among the Nordic countries.

### 5. Regional and Multilateral Approaches Compared

Regional arrangements and the multilateral Convention serve complementary rather than competing purposes. Regional frameworks offer several advantages: they can be tailored to specific regional needs, legal systems, and development levels; they often form part of broader economic integration efforts; and they enable faster implementation among fewer parties with shared interests. Regional bodies such as ATAF and CIAT also provide platforms for developing countries to articulate their positions in global tax debates and receive targeted capacity building assistance.

The multilateral Convention, by contrast, offers comprehensive global coverage across 150 jurisdictions and provides a standardised framework that simplifies cooperation among diverse parties. Most countries participate in both their relevant regional arrangements and the multilateral Convention, using each framework according to its strengths. The regional approach provides depth and customisation within geographic areas, while the multilateral approach ensures breadth and consistency across the global tax transparency architecture.
