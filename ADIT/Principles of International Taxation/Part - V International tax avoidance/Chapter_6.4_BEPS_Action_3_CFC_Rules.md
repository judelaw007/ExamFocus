## Chapter 6.4: BEPS Action 3 - Controlled Foreign Company Rules

### 1. Introduction to CFC Rules

Controlled foreign company rules represent one of the oldest and most established mechanisms for preventing the artificial deferral of taxation through the use of foreign subsidiaries. These rules attribute income earned by a foreign subsidiary to its domestic parent company, subjecting that income to immediate taxation in the parent's jurisdiction rather than allowing indefinite deferral until the income is repatriated as dividends. The fundamental premise is that where a resident taxpayer controls a foreign entity, the income of that entity should be taxable to the controlling shareholder regardless of whether distributions are made.

The origins of CFC legislation date to the United States' Subpart F rules enacted in 1962, responding to concerns that US multinational enterprises were accumulating profits in foreign subsidiaries located in low-tax jurisdictions to defer US taxation indefinitely. Other major economies subsequently developed their own CFC regimes, though with considerable variation in design and scope. This historical development meant that by the time the BEPS Project commenced, CFC rules already existed in many jurisdictions but lacked coordination, creating gaps that sophisticated tax planning could exploit.

BEPS Action 3 does not mandate specific CFC rules but instead provides recommendations for designing effective CFC regimes. Unlike BEPS Actions 5, 6, 13, and 14, which establish minimum standards subject to peer review, Action 3 represents best practices that jurisdictions may adopt voluntarily. This status reflects the significant policy variations among existing CFC regimes and the difficulty of achieving consensus on mandatory harmonised rules. Nevertheless, the recommendations provide a framework for jurisdictions seeking to strengthen their CFC provisions and for evaluating the effectiveness of existing rules.

### 2. Policy Rationale for CFC Rules

#### 2.1. Addressing Profit Shifting

The primary policy objective of CFC rules is to prevent resident taxpayers from shifting profits to controlled entities in low-tax jurisdictions where those profits can accumulate without being subject to tax in the parent's jurisdiction. Without CFC rules, a parent company could establish a subsidiary in a jurisdiction with minimal taxation, transfer income-generating assets or activities to that subsidiary, and defer domestic taxation on the resulting profits indefinitely by simply not declaring dividends.

This profit shifting undermines the tax base of the parent company's jurisdiction and creates competitive distortions between enterprises that can implement such structures and those that cannot. Domestically-focused businesses pay tax on their profits currently, while multinational enterprises with the resources and sophistication to establish offshore structures can achieve significant deferral advantages. CFC rules address this inequity by treating the controlled foreign entity's income as if it were earned directly by the parent.

#### 2.2. Strengthening Residence-Based Taxation

CFC rules operate within the residence-based taxation principle, under which countries assert taxing rights over the worldwide income of their residents. While source countries have primary taxing rights over income arising within their borders, residence countries traditionally claim residual taxing rights over their residents' foreign income, providing credit for foreign taxes paid to avoid double taxation.

The effectiveness of residence-based taxation depends on the residence country's ability to tax foreign income when earned rather than only when repatriated. CFC rules strengthen this capability by looking through the separate legal personality of controlled foreign entities and attributing their income to resident shareholders. This "transparency" approach treats the foreign entity as a conduit rather than a separate taxpayer, preventing the use of foreign incorporation to escape residence country taxation.

#### 2.3. Complementing Other Anti-Avoidance Measures

CFC rules complement other anti-avoidance measures within the BEPS framework. While transfer pricing rules under Actions 8-10 ensure that transactions between related parties are priced at arm's length, they do not prevent income from being legitimately located in low-tax jurisdictions where real activities occur. CFC rules provide an additional layer of protection by taxing low-taxed foreign income regardless of whether transfer pricing rules have been satisfied.

Similarly, CFC rules interact with interest limitation rules under Action 4 and hybrid mismatch rules under Action 2. A multinational group might satisfy the requirements of these specific anti-avoidance provisions while still accumulating low-taxed income in foreign subsidiaries. Effective CFC rules ensure that such income is ultimately taxed in the parent jurisdiction, providing comprehensive protection against base erosion.

### 3. The Six Building Blocks

BEPS Action 3 identifies six building blocks for designing effective CFC rules. These building blocks do not prescribe specific solutions but instead present options and considerations for each element of CFC regime design.

#### 3.1. Definition of a CFC

The first building block addresses which foreign entities should be subject to CFC rules. The definition typically requires both a foreign element and a control element. An entity is foreign if it is resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction other than the parent's jurisdiction. Control is usually defined by reference to ownership thresholds, voting rights, or other indicators of influence over the entity's affairs.

The OECD recommendations suggest that control thresholds should capture entities where resident shareholders have sufficient influence to direct the entity's activities. A common threshold is 50 percent ownership or voting control, though some jurisdictions use lower thresholds to capture situations where significant influence exists without majority control. The recommendations also note that control should be assessed on both a legal and economic basis, and that related parties should be aggregated when determining whether control thresholds are met.

The scope of entities covered also varies. Some jurisdictions apply CFC rules only to companies, while others extend coverage to trusts, partnerships, and other arrangements that could be used to accumulate income outside the parent jurisdiction. The recommendations favour broad coverage to prevent avoidance through entity selection.

#### 3.2. CFC Exemptions and Threshold Requirements

The second building block addresses exemptions and thresholds that exclude certain CFCs or certain income from CFC taxation. These provisions recognise that applying CFC rules to all foreign subsidiaries would create excessive compliance burdens and might discourage legitimate international business activities.

Tax rate exemptions exclude CFCs resident in jurisdictions with tax rates comparable to the parent jurisdiction. The rationale is that where foreign income is already taxed at a similar rate, there is no significant deferral advantage to address. The threshold for this exemption varies, with some jurisdictions requiring the foreign rate to equal or exceed the domestic rate and others accepting a rate within a specified percentage of the domestic rate.

De minimis thresholds exclude CFCs with income below specified amounts, recognising that the compliance cost of applying CFC rules to small amounts of income may exceed the revenue benefit. Similarly, active business exemptions may exclude CFCs engaged primarily in genuine trading activities in their jurisdiction of residence, targeting CFC rules at passive income accumulation rather than active foreign operations.

#### 3.3. Definition of CFC Income

The third building block determines which income of a CFC should be attributed to the parent company. This represents one of the most significant design choices, with approaches ranging from attributing all CFC income to attributing only specific categories of income that raise BEPS concerns.

The categorical approach identifies specific types of income for attribution, typically focusing on passive or highly mobile income such as dividends, interest, royalties, and rental income. This approach reflects the view that active business income earned through genuine economic activities in the CFC's jurisdiction should not be attributed, while passive income that can easily be shifted between jurisdictions warrants CFC treatment.

The excess profits approach attributes income that exceeds a normal return on the CFC's activities, on the theory that excess profits are more likely to result from profit shifting arrangements. The transactional approach focuses on income from related party transactions, recognising that transactions with independent parties are more likely to reflect genuine commercial arrangements.

The OECD recommendations do not mandate a particular approach but note that the definition of CFC income should ensure that income raising BEPS concerns is captured while avoiding attribution of genuinely commercial income from active business activities.

#### 3.4. Computation of CFC Income

The fourth building block addresses how CFC income should be calculated for attribution purposes. The primary question is whether to compute income under the rules of the parent jurisdiction or the CFC's jurisdiction.

Computing income under parent jurisdiction rules ensures consistency with how other income of the parent is taxed and prevents manipulation through differences in accounting standards or tax rules between jurisdictions. However, this approach requires the parent to maintain parallel calculations of the CFC's income, creating compliance complexity.

The recommendations favour computation under parent jurisdiction rules, with specific provisions to prevent the use of losses to reduce attributed income inappropriately. CFC losses should generally be available only to offset income of the same CFC or other CFCs in the same jurisdiction, preventing losses from being used to shelter income that would otherwise be attributed.

#### 3.5. Attribution of CFC Income

The fifth building block determines how attributed income is allocated among shareholders entitled to participate in the CFC's profits. Attribution typically follows ownership percentages, with income attributed pro rata to shareholders meeting the control or attribution threshold.

The attribution threshold may differ from the control threshold used to determine whether an entity is a CFC. For example, a jurisdiction might define a CFC as an entity more than 50 percent controlled by resident shareholders collectively, but attribute income to any shareholder holding more than 10 percent. This ensures that significant shareholders cannot avoid attribution by structuring ownership just below the control threshold.

The recommendations emphasise that attribution should occur at the point when income is earned by the CFC, not when it is distributed. This current inclusion approach achieves the policy objective of eliminating deferral advantages that would otherwise arise from postponing distributions.

#### 3.6. Prevention and Elimination of Double Taxation

The sixth building block addresses the risk that CFC rules could result in the same income being taxed multiple times. Double taxation could arise where both the CFC's jurisdiction and the parent's jurisdiction tax the same income, or where income attributed under CFC rules is subsequently taxed again when distributed as dividends.

Relief mechanisms include foreign tax credits for taxes paid by the CFC in its jurisdiction of residence and exemptions for dividends from CFCs to the extent the underlying income was previously attributed. These mechanisms ensure that CFC rules achieve their objective of current taxation without imposing cumulative tax burdens that would discourage legitimate international investment.

The interaction between CFC rules and tax treaties raises additional complexity. The OECD Commentary confirms that CFC rules are not contrary to treaty obligations because they involve residence countries taxing their own residents, which treaties do not prohibit. However, the availability of treaty relief for underlying foreign taxes may depend on specific treaty provisions and domestic law interpretations.

### 4. Approaches to CFC Regime Design

#### 4.1. Jurisdictional Approach

Under a jurisdictional approach, CFC rules apply based on characteristics of the CFC's jurisdiction of residence rather than the nature of the income earned. CFCs resident in blacklisted jurisdictions or jurisdictions with tax rates below a specified threshold are subject to CFC rules regardless of their activities, while CFCs in other jurisdictions may be exempt.

This approach offers administrative simplicity by avoiding the need to analyse the character of income earned. However, it may be over-inclusive by capturing active business income in low-tax jurisdictions and under-inclusive by exempting passive income accumulated in jurisdictions not on the blacklist.

#### 4.2. Transactional Approach

The transactional approach focuses on the nature of transactions generating CFC income, applying CFC rules to income from related party transactions while exempting income from dealings with independent parties. The rationale is that related party transactions present the greatest opportunity for profit shifting manipulation.

This approach aligns with transfer pricing principles by recognising that arm's length transactions with independent parties are less likely to represent BEPS arrangements. However, it requires detailed analysis of the CFC's transactions and may not capture all situations where passive income is accumulated without genuine business substance.

#### 4.3. Entity Approach

The entity approach applies CFC rules based on the overall character of the CFC's activities, distinguishing between entities engaged primarily in active business operations and those functioning primarily as holding companies for passive investments. CFCs meeting active business tests may be fully exempt from CFC rules.

This approach recognises that multinational enterprises legitimately establish foreign subsidiaries for active business purposes and that subjecting all such subsidiaries to CFC rules would impose excessive compliance burdens. However, the distinction between active and passive activities can be manipulated, and hybrid entities engaging in both types of activities present classification challenges.

### 5. Implementation in Major Jurisdictions

#### 5.1. The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive

The European Union incorporated CFC rules as one of the mandatory measures in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive adopted in 2016. Member States were required to implement CFC provisions by January 2019, though flexibility was provided regarding specific design choices.

The ATAD permits Member States to choose between two models for defining CFC income. Model A attributes specific categories of passive income to the parent where that income arises from non-genuine arrangements put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage. Model B applies to all non-distributed income of the CFC to the extent arising from assets and risks linked to significant people functions carried out by the controlling company.

The directive requires CFC rules to apply where the CFC is subject to an effective tax rate less than 50 percent of the tax that would have been charged in the Member State. This ensures that CFCs in low-tax jurisdictions are captured while avoiding application to subsidiaries in jurisdictions with comparable tax rates.

#### 5.2. Implementation Beyond the EU

The United States substantially reformed its CFC rules through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, introducing the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions that effectively impose minimum taxation on foreign subsidiary income. GILTI applies to income exceeding a deemed return on tangible assets, with a reduced tax rate and partial foreign tax credit.

The United Kingdom's CFC regime underwent significant reform in 2012, moving from an all-income approach to one focused on profits artificially diverted from the UK. The regime now analyses whether UK activities have been involved in generating the CFC's profits, with gateway tests determining which CFCs require detailed analysis.

Other major economies including Japan, Germany, France, and Australia maintain comprehensive CFC regimes, though with significant variations in design reflecting different policy priorities and tax system structures. This variation means that multinational groups must analyse CFC implications under multiple jurisdictions' rules, creating complexity but also potential gaps where rules do not align.

### 6. Relationship with Tax Treaties

#### 6.1. Treaty Compatibility

The compatibility of CFC rules with tax treaty obligations has been debated extensively. Some commentators argued that CFC rules violate treaty provisions by taxing income that treaties allocate to source countries or by denying treaty benefits to which CFCs would otherwise be entitled.

The OECD position, reflected in the Commentary on Article 1 of the Model Tax Convention, is that CFC rules are not contrary to treaty provisions. The Commentary explains that CFC rules involve residence countries taxing their own residents on income attributed to them, which does not conflict with treaty allocation of taxing rights. Treaties govern the relationship between contracting states regarding income arising in one state and paid to residents of the other; they do not prevent a residence state from taxing its own residents on income attributed under domestic law.

This interpretation is reinforced by the savings clause included in many treaties, which preserves each contracting state's right to tax its own residents regardless of other treaty provisions. Where treaties include savings clauses, the residence state's authority to apply CFC rules is expressly preserved.

#### 6.2. Relief for Foreign Taxes

Even where CFC rules are compatible with treaties, questions arise regarding relief for taxes paid by the CFC in its jurisdiction of residence. CFC rules attribute income to the parent company rather than the CFC itself, potentially creating mismatches between the entity paying foreign tax and the entity claiming relief.

Most jurisdictions address this through indirect credit mechanisms that allow the parent to claim credit for underlying foreign taxes paid by the CFC on income attributed under CFC rules. However, the precise operation of these mechanisms varies, and taxpayers must carefully analyse whether relief is available under applicable domestic law and treaty provisions.

### 7. Relationship with Pillar Two

The introduction of the global minimum tax under Pillar Two raises important questions about the continued relevance and operation of CFC rules. Pillar Two's Income Inclusion Rule operates similarly to CFC rules by attributing low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries to parent companies, raising the possibility of duplication or conflict between the regimes.

The Income Inclusion Rule applies to multinational enterprise groups with consolidated revenue exceeding €750 million, imposing top-up tax where a subsidiary's effective tax rate falls below 15 percent. This mechanism achieves similar objectives to CFC rules by ensuring minimum taxation of foreign subsidiary income, potentially reducing the need for separate CFC provisions.

However, CFC rules and Pillar Two differ in significant respects. CFC rules typically apply based on control thresholds lower than Pillar Two's ownership requirements, may define income differently, and impose tax at the parent jurisdiction's full rate rather than a minimum rate. Groups below the Pillar Two threshold remain subject only to applicable CFC rules, maintaining the relevance of these provisions for smaller multinational enterprises.

The interaction between CFC rules and Pillar Two requires careful coordination to avoid double taxation. Income already subject to CFC taxation should not also be subject to top-up tax under the Income Inclusion Rule, and jurisdictions implementing Pillar Two must consider how their CFC rules interact with the new framework.

### 8. Effectiveness and Challenges

#### 8.1. Coordination Gaps

The voluntary nature of BEPS Action 3 recommendations has resulted in continued variation among CFC regimes globally. While the recommendations provide a framework for effective CFC rules, jurisdictions retain significant discretion over implementation, and many have not updated their regimes to align with the recommendations.

This variation creates planning opportunities for multinational enterprises able to identify gaps between different jurisdictions' CFC rules. A structure might avoid CFC treatment under the parent jurisdiction's rules while benefiting from the absence or weakness of CFC rules in other relevant jurisdictions. Comprehensive BEPS protection requires coordinated CFC rules across all jurisdictions where parent companies might be located.

#### 8.2. Compliance Complexity

Effective CFC rules require detailed analysis of foreign subsidiary operations, income character, and tax treatment across multiple jurisdictions. This complexity creates significant compliance burdens for multinational enterprises, particularly those with numerous foreign subsidiaries operating in diverse markets.

The need to compute CFC income under parent jurisdiction rules while the CFC maintains accounts under local standards requires parallel record-keeping and analysis. Attribution calculations require understanding of foreign tax rules to determine whether income meets CFC thresholds and to compute available foreign tax credits. These requirements impose costs that may be disproportionate to the revenue protection achieved, particularly for smaller enterprises with limited resources.

#### 8.3. Evolving Challenges

The digital economy presents new challenges for CFC rules designed primarily around traditional business models. Digital businesses may generate significant profits through intellectual property held in low-tax jurisdictions without the physical presence that triggers CFC scrutiny under some regimes. Ensuring that CFC rules effectively address digital economy profit shifting may require adaptation of existing frameworks.

The interaction between CFC rules, Pillar Two, and other BEPS measures creates a complex web of anti-avoidance provisions that must operate coherently. As international tax rules continue to evolve, CFC regimes may require ongoing adaptation to maintain their effectiveness while avoiding unintended consequences from regulatory overlap.

### 9. Practical Considerations

When advising on CFC implications, practitioners must first identify all jurisdictions where CFC rules might apply, recognising that multiple parent companies in a chain might independently trigger CFC obligations. The definition of control and the aggregation rules for related parties must be analysed under each relevant jurisdiction's rules.

Having identified applicable CFC regimes, the next step is determining whether exemptions or thresholds exclude the CFC or its income from attribution. Tax rate exemptions, active business exemptions, and de minimis thresholds must be evaluated based on the specific criteria of each jurisdiction.

Where CFC rules apply, computing attributed income requires understanding both the income definition under applicable rules and the mechanics of the computation. Documentation should demonstrate the character of income, the basis for any exemptions claimed, and the calculation of foreign tax credits available to offset CFC inclusions.
