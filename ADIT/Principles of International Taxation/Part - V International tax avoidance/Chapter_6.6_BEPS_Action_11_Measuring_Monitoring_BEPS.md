## Chapter 6.6: BEPS Action 11 - Measuring and Monitoring BEPS

### 1. Introduction to BEPS Action 11

BEPS Action 11 occupies a unique position within the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative. Unlike other BEPS Actions which introduce substantive rules or legislative recommendations, Action 11 is fundamentally administrative in nature. Its mandate is to establish methodologies for collecting and analysing data on base erosion and profit shifting, and to monitor the effectiveness of measures taken to address BEPS on an ongoing basis.

The rationale for Action 11 stems from a fundamental challenge that confronted policymakers when the BEPS Project commenced: the lack of reliable data quantifying the scale and scope of profit shifting by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Without robust measurement tools, it would be impossible to assess whether the actions taken under the BEPS initiative were actually achieving their intended objectives. Action 11 therefore serves as the monitoring and evaluation infrastructure for the entire BEPS framework.

The 2015 Final Report on Action 11 estimated that annual global corporate income tax revenue losses attributable to BEPS range from USD 100 billion to USD 240 billion, representing approximately 4 to 10 percent of global corporate income tax revenues. These figures, while subject to significant uncertainty, provided the first comprehensive attempt to quantify the fiscal impact of profit shifting and established a baseline against which future progress could be measured.

### 2. Historical Context and the 2015 Final Report

#### 2.1. Origins of Action 11

The inclusion of a measurement and monitoring action within the BEPS framework reflected recognition that addressing profit shifting required more than legislative reforms alone. Effective policy responses depend on understanding the mechanisms through which BEPS occurs, the jurisdictions most affected, and the extent to which implemented measures are achieving their objectives.

Prior to Action 11, analysis of profit shifting relied primarily on academic studies using limited datasets, often focusing on specific countries or industries. These studies provided valuable insights but could not offer the comprehensive, internationally consistent data needed to inform global policy responses. Action 11 sought to address this gap by developing indicators that could be applied consistently across jurisdictions and tracked over time.

#### 2.2. The BEPS Revenue Loss Estimates

The 2015 Final Report acknowledged significant uncertainty in estimating BEPS-related revenue losses. The range of USD 100 to 240 billion annually reflected the limitations of available data and the inherent difficulty in distinguishing legitimate tax planning from aggressive profit shifting. The report emphasised that these estimates should be interpreted as indicative of the scale of the problem rather than precise measurements.

Several methodological approaches contributed to these estimates. Macro-level analysis examined discrepancies between reported profits and economic activity indicators across jurisdictions. Micro-level studies used firm-level financial data to identify patterns consistent with profit shifting, such as unusually high profit rates in low-tax jurisdictions. Academic research on effective tax rates provided additional evidence of differential taxation between multinational and purely domestic enterprises.

### 3. The Six BEPS Indicators

The 2015 Final Report introduced six indicators designed to provide evidence of BEPS activity. These indicators operate as a dashboard, with each offering a different perspective on profit shifting behaviour. No single indicator can definitively prove BEPS; rather, the indicators work together to provide a composite picture of profit shifting patterns.

#### 3.1. Indicator 1: FDI Concentration Relative to GDP

The first indicator examines the ratio of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) stock to gross domestic product (GDP). Unusually high FDI-to-GDP ratios may suggest that a jurisdiction serves as an investment hub through which profits flow rather than as a location of genuine economic activity.

The indicator uses thresholds to identify potential BEPS jurisdictions. Net FDI ratios exceeding 50 percent of GDP, or gross FDI ratios exceeding 200 percent of GDP, trigger further investigation. Jurisdictions such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands historically display such patterns, though this alone cannot distinguish BEPS-related investment from legitimate economic activity in financial services or holding company structures.

#### 3.2. Indicator 2: Profit Rates of Low-Taxed Affiliates

This enterprise-level indicator compares profit rates of MNE affiliates in low-tax jurisdictions against the worldwide average for the MNE group. Where affiliates in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates consistently report profit margins substantially exceeding group averages, this pattern may indicate profit shifting toward those locations.

The analysis requires access to firm-level financial data, typically obtained from commercial databases or national tax authorities. Comparing an affiliate reporting a 40 percent pre-tax profit margin in a jurisdiction with a 10 percent tax rate against a group average margin of 15 percent suggests the possibility of artificial profit concentration.

#### 3.3. Indicator 3: Profit Concentration in Low-Tax Locations

Related to but distinct from Indicator 2, this indicator examines whether MNE profits are disproportionately concentrated in lower-tax jurisdictions relative to indicators of real economic activity such as employees and tangible assets. Analysis of country-by-country reporting data reveals instances where the geographic distribution of profits does not align with the distribution of employees, physical assets, or value-creating activities.

Evidence of profit misalignment remains a focus of ongoing monitoring. Even after implementation of substantive BEPS measures, data continues to show some degree of disconnect between profit location and economic substance, though recent trends suggest improvement.

#### 3.4. Indicator 4: Effective Tax Rate Differentials

The fourth indicator represents the most technically sophisticated approach, employing econometric analysis to compare effective tax rates (ETRs) between large MNE affiliates and comparable domestic enterprises. The methodology uses propensity score matching to control for firm characteristics beyond tax factors, such as size, industry, asset structure, and profitability patterns.

Research using this approach consistently finds that MNE affiliates have statistically significantly lower effective tax rates than domestic firms with similar observable characteristics. While this differential cannot be attributed entirely to profit shifting—legitimate business reasons may also contribute—the persistence of the gap across multiple studies and jurisdictions provides evidence consistent with BEPS activity.

#### 3.5. Indicator 5: Royalty Receipts Relative to R&D Spending

This indicator focuses on profit shifting through intangible assets, which represents one of the most significant BEPS channels. The analysis compares royalty income received in a jurisdiction against research and development (R&D) expenditure incurred there. Jurisdictions receiving substantial royalty income relative to their R&D activity may be benefiting from intellectual property (IP) migration strategies.

A jurisdiction where an MNE subsidiary receives USD 500 million annually in royalty payments for patent use while incurring only USD 50 million in R&D expenditure displays a ratio of 10:1 that warrants further examination. Such patterns may indicate that IP has been relocated to the jurisdiction primarily for tax rather than operational reasons, though legitimate business restructurings can also produce similar results.

#### 3.6. Indicator 6: Interest Expense to Income Ratios

The sixth indicator addresses base erosion through interest deductions. It examines whether MNE affiliates in high-tax jurisdictions display higher interest expense relative to income compared with affiliates in low-tax jurisdictions. Excessive interest deductions in high-tax locations reduce the taxable base in those jurisdictions while corresponding interest income may be taxed lightly elsewhere.

This indicator complements BEPS Action 4 on interest limitation rules. By tracking interest deduction patterns, Action 11 can assess whether the fixed ratio rules and group ratio rules recommended under Action 4 are achieving their objective of limiting base erosion through excessive debt financing.

### 4. Data Sources and Methodology

#### 4.1. Country-by-Country Reporting Data

Country-by-country reporting (CbCR), established under BEPS Action 13, provides the primary data source for Action 11 analysis. CbCR requires MNEs with consolidated group revenue exceeding EUR 750 million to report key financial and operational data for each jurisdiction in which they operate. This includes revenues, profits, taxes paid, employees, and tangible assets.

As of 2025, approximately 120 jurisdictions have implemented CbCR requirements. The data is collected by tax authorities and exchanged through the CbCR Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement. For Action 11 purposes, data is anonymised and aggregated to protect taxpayer confidentiality while enabling analysis of global patterns.

The 2025 Corporate Tax Statistics edition introduced new disaggregation of CbCR data by MNE group size and by tax jurisdiction, enhancing the granularity available for BEPS monitoring. This allows analysts to examine whether profit shifting patterns differ between the largest MNEs and smaller multinational groups, and to track specific jurisdictions of concern.

#### 4.2. Corporate Tax Statistics Database

The OECD Corporate Tax Statistics database serves as the flagship publication for Action 11 monitoring. First released in January 2019 and updated annually, the database compiles statistics on corporate taxation across Inclusive Framework jurisdictions. It includes statutory and effective corporate tax rates, tax incentive data, implementation status of various BEPS Actions, and aggregate CbCR statistics.

The 2025 edition expanded coverage to 104 jurisdictions for effective tax rate data, up from 90 in previous years. It also incorporated new statistics on BEPS Action 2 (hybrid mismatch arrangements) implementation and Action 12 (mandatory disclosure rules), broadening the scope of monitoring beyond the original six indicators.

#### 4.3. Supplementary Data Sources

Action 11 analysis draws on additional data sources to complement CbCR and tax authority statistics. FDI statistics from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and national central banks inform Indicator 1 calculations. Microdata from commercial databases such as Bureau van Dijk's Orbis provides firm-level financial information for enterprise-level indicators. Intellectual property registrations and royalty flow data from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and balance of payments statistics support Indicator 5 analysis.

The multi-source approach reflects both the complexity of BEPS and the limitations of any single dataset. By triangulating across different data sources and methodological approaches, Action 11 seeks to provide more robust conclusions than would be possible from any individual source.

### 5. Relationship with Other BEPS Actions

#### 5.1. Connection with Action 13

The relationship between Action 11 and Action 13 is direct and integral. Action 13 creates the reporting infrastructure—CbCR—that generates much of the data Action 11 analyses. Without the standardised, jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction data that CbCR provides, comprehensive monitoring of BEPS trends would not be feasible.

CbCR data enables Action 11 to calculate indicators, track trends over time, identify jurisdictions displaying anomalous patterns, and assess whether substantive BEPS measures are achieving their intended effects. The reciprocal relationship means that improvements to CbCR reporting—such as expanded data fields or lower thresholds—directly enhance Action 11 monitoring capabilities.

#### 5.2. Monitoring Transfer Pricing Actions

Actions 8 through 10 address transfer pricing, seeking to align profit allocation with value creation. Action 11 monitors the effectiveness of these reforms by tracking indicators related to intangible assets and profit misalignment. Indicator 5 on royalty concentration directly relates to Action 8 on intangibles, while Indicators 2 and 3 on profit rates help assess whether transfer pricing outcomes are becoming more aligned with economic activity.

The aggregate nature of Action 11 data means it cannot evaluate individual transfer pricing arrangements. However, it can identify sectoral or jurisdictional patterns suggesting that transfer pricing reforms may require strengthening or refinement.

#### 5.3. Evaluating Interest Limitation Rules

Action 4 recommends rules limiting interest deductions, typically to 10-30 percent of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Action 11's Indicator 6 tracks interest expense patterns across jurisdictions, providing evidence of whether these rules are reducing base erosion through excessive debt financing.

The 2025 Corporate Tax Statistics reports that 106 jurisdictions have implemented interest limitation rules, a substantial increase from 67 in 2019. Action 11 monitoring assesses whether this widespread implementation is translating into reduced interest-based profit shifting at the aggregate level.

### 6. Implementation and the Inclusive Framework

#### 6.1. The Role of the Inclusive Framework

The Inclusive Framework on BEPS, established in 2016, brings together over 140 jurisdictions committed to implementing BEPS measures. For Action 11, the Inclusive Framework serves multiple functions: it provides the institutional mechanism for data collection and sharing, coordinates peer review processes, and disseminates analytical findings through publications such as Corporate Tax Statistics.

Participation in the Inclusive Framework gives jurisdictions access to OECD databases, analytical tools, and technical assistance. It also enables them to contribute their own data to the global monitoring effort, ensuring that Action 11 analysis reflects a truly international picture rather than being limited to OECD member countries.

#### 6.2. Peer Review Processes

While Action 11 itself is not subject to peer review as a minimum standard, its monitoring function supports peer review of other Actions. Actions 5 (harmful tax practices), 6 (treaty abuse prevention), 13 (CbCR), and 14 (dispute resolution) are designated as minimum standards subject to ongoing peer review. Action 11 provides the quantitative evidence that informs these reviews and tracks whether peer review recommendations are producing measurable results.

### 7. Current Developments and Evidence

#### 7.1. Corporate Tax Statistics 2025 Findings

The 2025 edition of Corporate Tax Statistics provides the most comprehensive assessment to date of BEPS trends. Key findings include evidence suggesting modest but meaningful reductions in profit shifting since the BEPS Project commenced. Profits per employee in investment hub jurisdictions declined 18.1 percent between 2017 and 2022. Similarly, these jurisdictions' share of total MNE profits fell from 31.9 percent to 18.9 percent over the same period.

Corporate tax rates have stabilised after decades of decline. The average statutory corporate income tax rate across Inclusive Framework jurisdictions stood at 21.2 percent in 2025, up slightly from 21.1 percent in 2024, following a long-term decline from 28.0 percent in 2000. This stabilisation may reflect the combined effect of BEPS measures and anticipation of the global minimum tax under Pillar Two.

#### 7.2. Evidence of BEPS Reduction

While acknowledging significant caveats, the data suggests that BEPS measures are having some effect. Implementation of substantive Actions has progressed substantially: 45 jurisdictions have adopted hybrid mismatch rules under Action 2, 56 jurisdictions have controlled foreign company (CFC) rules under Action 3, and 46 IP regimes have been confirmed as non-harmful under Action 5.

The shift in profit concentration away from investment hubs, though not solely attributable to BEPS measures, is consistent with the intended effect of reforms targeting artificial profit shifting. Continued monitoring will be necessary to determine whether these trends persist and whether they translate into measurable revenue gains for affected jurisdictions.

### 8. Limitations and Challenges

#### 8.1. Data Limitations

The OECD explicitly acknowledges significant data limitations constraining Action 11 analysis. Many jurisdictions lack consistent historical data, limiting trend analysis. Confidentiality restrictions prevent access to individual company tax returns, requiring reliance on aggregated or anonymised data. Varying national accounting standards complicate cross-jurisdictional comparisons.

CbCR data, while transformative in its scope, covers only MNEs exceeding the EUR 750 million revenue threshold. This creates sample bias toward larger enterprises and excludes smaller multinationals that may also engage in profit shifting. Reporting lags mean that analysis typically uses data one to two years old.

#### 8.2. Methodological Constraints

The indicators developed under Action 11 provide general indications of BEPS activity rather than definitive proof. Confounding factors beyond profit shifting affect each indicator. High FDI-to-GDP ratios may reflect legitimate financial services activity. Differential profit rates may result from genuine value creation in low-tax jurisdictions. Interest patterns may follow legitimate commercial financing structures.

Academic replication studies have confirmed that while the indicators provide evidence consistent with BEPS, they cannot isolate profit shifting effects from other business model factors. The indicators serve as starting points for further investigation rather than conclusive determinations of profit shifting.

### 9. Practical Implications

#### 9.1. Implications for Tax Authorities

Tax authorities can use Action 11 indicators to identify BEPS risks within their jurisdictions, benchmark against peer countries, and prioritise audit resources. Participation in the Inclusive Framework provides access to analytical tools and comparative data that enhance domestic enforcement capabilities.

The monitoring framework also informs policy decisions on implementing additional BEPS measures. Jurisdictions observing continued evidence of profit shifting may conclude that existing rules require strengthening, while those showing improvement may focus on maintaining current approaches.

#### 9.2. Implications for Multinational Enterprises

For MNEs, Action 11 has increased the visibility of profit concentration patterns. Jurisdictions identified as investment hubs face enhanced scrutiny from tax authorities globally. Structures involving high profits relative to economic substance attract greater audit attention and reputational risk.

The expanding scope of monitoring—including integration with Pillar Two reporting requirements—requires enterprises to ensure that tax positions are supported by genuine commercial substance. The era of purely tax-motivated structures has given way to requirements for demonstrable economic presence aligned with reported profits. MNEs must now consider how their structures will appear when aggregated into global monitoring data, as patterns that appear unremarkable at the individual company level may be highly visible in cross-jurisdictional analysis.

#### 9.3. Implications for Developing Countries

Developing countries face particular challenges in benefiting from Action 11 monitoring. Many lack the administrative capacity to collect and analyse the sophisticated data required for indicator calculations. Technical assistance programmes through the Inclusive Framework seek to address this gap, but capacity constraints remain significant in many jurisdictions.

The aggregate findings from Action 11 are nonetheless valuable for developing countries. Evidence of profit shifting patterns in specific sectors—such as extractive industries or digital services—can inform targeted domestic reforms. Access to comparative data through the Inclusive Framework allows developing countries to benchmark their own tax bases against international norms and identify potential areas of revenue loss.

### 10. Future Developments

The scope of Action 11 monitoring continues to evolve in response to changes in the international tax landscape. The implementation of Pillar Two's global minimum tax creates new data sources through Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) information returns that will supplement existing CbCR data. This expansion will enable more comprehensive tracking of effective tax rates and may provide clearer evidence of whether the 15 percent minimum rate is reducing incentives for profit shifting.

Parallel developments at the United Nations, including work toward a Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, may expand the institutional infrastructure for tax data collection beyond the OECD. These developments could enhance the comprehensiveness and legitimacy of global tax monitoring, particularly for developing countries that seek greater voice in international tax governance.

The evolution of digital business models and the growing importance of intangible assets will require continued refinement of BEPS indicators. Current methodologies may not fully capture profit shifting through digital platforms or the allocation of returns to data and user participation. Future iterations of Action 11 will need to address these emerging challenges to maintain the relevance of BEPS monitoring in a changing economic environment.
