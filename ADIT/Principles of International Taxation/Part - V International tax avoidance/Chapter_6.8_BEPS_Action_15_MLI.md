## Chapter 6.8: BEPS Action 15 - Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures (MLI)

### 1. Introduction to BEPS Action 15

BEPS Action 15 represents one of the most innovative outcomes of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. Rather than introducing substantive tax rules, Action 15 created a procedural mechanism—the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI)—designed to modify existing bilateral double taxation conventions simultaneously without requiring renegotiation of each treaty individually.

The fundamental challenge addressed by Action 15 was implementation speed. The BEPS Project produced numerous recommendations affecting treaty provisions, including measures on treaty abuse prevention, permanent establishment definitions, dispute resolution, and hybrid mismatch arrangements. Implementing these recommendations through traditional bilateral renegotiation would have required decades, given that over 3,000 bilateral tax treaties exist worldwide. The MLI provides a mechanism for jurisdictions to adopt BEPS treaty measures efficiently across their entire treaty networks.

The MLI entered into force on 1 July 2018, following ratification by the required five jurisdictions. It represents the first multilateral instrument in history specifically designed to modify bilateral tax treaties and stands as a landmark achievement in international tax cooperation.

### 2. Historical Context and Policy Rationale

#### 2.1. The Bilateral Treaty Network

The international tax system developed over a century through bilateral negotiations between pairs of countries. Each double taxation convention (DTC) represents a negotiated compromise reflecting the specific economic relationships, bargaining positions, and policy priorities of the two contracting states. This bilateral approach produced a network of treaties that, while sharing common elements derived from model conventions, contain significant variations in their specific provisions.

The bilateral model presented increasing challenges as globalisation accelerated. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating across dozens of jurisdictions could exploit inconsistencies between treaties, and addressing emerging issues required coordinating modifications across hundreds of separate agreements. The time and resources required for comprehensive bilateral renegotiation made responsive policy implementation impractical.

#### 2.2. The Multilateral Solution

The 2015 Final Report on Action 15 proposed developing a multilateral instrument that would operate alongside existing bilateral treaties rather than replacing them. This approach drew on successful precedents from other international law contexts, where multilateral conventions had been used to modify bilateral agreements in areas such as aviation, double taxation of estates, and arbitration.

The conceptual innovation was recognising that a multilateral instrument could modify the operation of bilateral treaties without requiring those treaties to be formally renegotiated. Jurisdictions would express their positions on various BEPS measures through the MLI, and where matching positions existed between treaty partners, the relevant provisions would modify their bilateral agreement.

The policy rationale extended beyond implementation efficiency. A multilateral approach ensured consistent implementation of BEPS measures across jurisdictions, reducing opportunities for arbitrage through treaty shopping or selective implementation. It also enabled developing countries to access treaty modifications that they might lack the negotiating capacity to obtain bilaterally.

### 3. The MLI Structure

The MLI is organised into seven parts, each addressing distinct aspects of treaty modification:

#### 3.1. Part I: Scope and Interpretation of Terms

Part I establishes the foundational framework for the MLI's operation. Article 1 specifies that the MLI modifies covered tax agreements (CTAs)—the bilateral treaties that each jurisdiction designates as subject to modification. Article 2 provides interpretation rules, including the important principle that the MLI operates alongside and modifies, rather than replaces, existing bilateral treaties.

A key concept introduced in Part I is the "compatibility clause," which addresses situations where the MLI provision interacts with existing treaty language. The MLI provisions supersede existing treaty provisions to the extent of incompatibility, while leaving other treaty provisions in force.

#### 3.2. Part II: Hybrid Mismatches

Part II addresses hybrid mismatch arrangements, implementing aspects of BEPS Action 2 in the treaty context. Article 3 deals with transparent entities, clarifying when income derived through fiscally transparent entities such as partnerships is entitled to treaty benefits. Article 4 addresses dual resident entities, providing a tie-breaker rule based on mutual agreement between competent authorities rather than automatic resolution criteria.

These provisions respond to arrangements where differences in entity characterisation between jurisdictions created opportunities for double non-taxation. By ensuring consistent treatment of transparent entities and preventing dual residence claims from being used to access treaty benefits inappropriately, Part II closes significant gaps in the existing treaty network.

#### 3.3. Part III: Treaty Abuse

Part III implements the treaty abuse prevention measures from BEPS Action 6. This section contains the minimum standard provisions that all MLI signatories must adopt, specifically through either the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) or the Simplified Limitation on Benefits (SLOB) clause, or both.

Article 6 requires inclusion of preamble language clarifying that treaties are intended to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including treaty shopping. Article 7 provides the PPT, under which treaty benefits may be denied where obtaining those benefits was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement or transaction. *(covered in June 2024)*

The anti-abuse provisions represent a significant strengthening of the international framework against treaty shopping. Prior to the MLI, many treaties lacked effective anti-avoidance provisions, enabling conduit arrangements that routed income through intermediate jurisdictions to access favourable treaty rates.

#### 3.4. Part IV: Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status

Part IV addresses artificial avoidance of permanent establishment (PE) status, implementing BEPS Action 7 recommendations. These provisions are optional, and jurisdictions may choose which to adopt.

Article 12 modifies commissionaire arrangements by expanding the dependent agent PE definition to include persons who habitually play the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts. Article 13 addresses specific activity exemptions, ensuring that preparatory and auxiliary activities do not enable artificial fragmentation of business operations to avoid PE status. Article 14 provides rules for splitting-up of contracts to prevent artificial division of projects to exploit time thresholds.

Article 15 addresses the definition of a person closely related to an enterprise, relevant for determining when separate entities' activities should be aggregated for PE analysis. These provisions collectively respond to strategies whereby businesses maintained substantial economic presence in jurisdictions without triggering taxable presence under traditional PE definitions.

#### 3.5. Part V: Improving Dispute Resolution

Part V implements BEPS Action 14 recommendations on dispute resolution, including the minimum standard on mutual agreement procedure (MAP). Article 16 establishes the MAP minimum standard, requiring that MAP requests be accepted even when domestic time limits have expired, provided they are submitted within three years of first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the treaty.

Article 17 provides for corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases, ensuring that where one state makes a primary adjustment, the other state provides appropriate relief to avoid economic double taxation.

Articles 18 through 26 establish the optional arbitration provisions. Mandatory binding arbitration represents one of the MLI's most significant optional features. Where competent authorities cannot resolve a MAP case within a specified period (typically two years), either party may request arbitration. The arbitration decision is binding on both states, providing taxpayers with certainty that unresolved disputes will reach definitive resolution.

#### 3.6. Part VI: Arbitration

Part VI contains the detailed procedural rules for arbitration cases. It specifies the constitution of arbitral panels, the default method of arbitration (last-best-offer or "baseball" arbitration), confidentiality requirements, and the effect of arbitration decisions.

The arbitration provisions were controversial during MLI negotiations, with some jurisdictions concerned about sovereignty implications and others lacking resources to participate effectively in arbitration proceedings. Consequently, arbitration remains optional, and fewer jurisdictions have adopted these provisions compared with the minimum standard measures.

#### 3.7. Part VII: Final Provisions

Part VII addresses signature, ratification, entry into force, and administrative matters. Notably, Article 34 specifies that the MLI enters into force on the first day of the month following three months after the deposit of the fifth instrument of ratification. For each subsequent jurisdiction, entry into force occurs on the first day of the month following three months after its ratification.

### 4. Core Mechanisms

#### 4.1. Covered Tax Agreements

The CTA concept is central to the MLI's operation. Each jurisdiction must provide a list of bilateral tax treaties it wishes the MLI to modify. Both parties to a bilateral treaty must list that treaty as a CTA for the MLI to have any effect. This reciprocal listing requirement ensures that modifications only apply where both treaty partners have consented.

As of January 2025, the MLI covers approximately 1,600-2,000 bilateral treaties. The coverage figure varies as jurisdictions continue to deposit ratification instruments and update their CTA lists.

#### 4.2. The Matching Principle

The matching principle determines when MLI provisions actually modify a CTA. Because the MLI offers numerous optional provisions and permits reservations, each jurisdiction's position on any given provision may differ. A provision only modifies a CTA where both treaty partners have adopted that provision without reserving against it.

The practical effect of matching can be illustrated with the PE provisions. If State A adopts Articles 12 through 15 on PE avoidance without reservations, but State B reserves against Article 13 (specific activity exemptions), then Article 13 will not apply to the bilateral treaty between them, while Articles 12, 14, and 15 would apply. This selective modification based on matched positions creates a matrix of varying provisions across different bilateral relationships.

This mechanism creates complexity in determining which provisions apply to any specific bilateral relationship. Synthesized texts—documents showing how the MLI modifies a specific bilateral treaty—are essential tools for practitioners navigating this complexity. Many jurisdictions and organisations have published synthesized texts for their treaty networks. The OECD maintains a database of MLI positions that facilitates this matching analysis.

#### 4.3. Reservations and Notifications

The MLI permits reservations against most provisions, allowing jurisdictions significant flexibility in their participation. Reservations must be deposited at the time of signature or ratification and may only be modified in limited circumstances. This approach enables broad participation while respecting jurisdictional differences in policy preferences.

Notifications perform a different function, specifying how a jurisdiction chooses to implement provisions that offer options. For example, a jurisdiction might notify that it chooses the PPT combined with the SLOB clause to satisfy the treaty abuse minimum standard, rather than the PPT alone. Notifications also identify which existing treaty provisions are replaced by MLI provisions.

### 5. Minimum Standards

#### 5.1. Treaty Abuse Prevention (Articles 6-7)

The treaty abuse prevention measures constitute the first minimum standard. All jurisdictions must implement either the PPT, the SLOB clause, or a combination. The PPT operates as a general anti-avoidance rule at the treaty level, denying benefits where obtaining those benefits was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement.

The PPT's principal purpose threshold is lower than a sole or dominant purpose test, capturing arrangements where tax benefits are among multiple significant objectives even if not the primary motivation. This broader scope strengthens anti-avoidance protection compared with narrower tests in some existing treaties. The test is objective, asking whether it is reasonable to conclude that obtaining the benefit was one of the principal purposes, rather than requiring evidence of subjective taxpayer intent.

The SLOB clause provides an alternative approach based on the US treaty model, requiring beneficial owners to satisfy objective criteria relating to ownership, activities, or public trading status. Jurisdictions may combine the PPT with a simplified SLOB to provide additional certainty for arrangements meeting the SLOB criteria while retaining the PPT as a backstop.

The preamble language required under Article 6 serves both interpretive and signalling functions. It clarifies the intended purpose of treaties and may influence courts' interpretation of treaty provisions in contexts beyond the specific anti-abuse rules.

#### 5.2. Mutual Agreement Procedure (Article 16)

The MAP minimum standard ensures effective access to dispute resolution. The three-year filing window, measured from first notification of the relevant taxation, provides taxpayers reasonable opportunity to pursue MAP relief even where domestic procedures have longer timelines.

This provision addresses situations where taxpayers discovered treaty-inconsistent taxation only after domestic limitation periods had expired, previously leaving them without recourse to MAP even where the treaty clearly entitled them to relief. The minimum standard ensures that treaty rights cannot be frustrated by domestic procedural rules.

### 6. Implementation Status

#### 6.1. Signatories and Ratifications

As of January 2025, 104 jurisdictions have signed the MLI. Of these, 79 jurisdictions have deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval, bringing the MLI into force for their treaty networks. Recent ratifications include Azerbaijan and Mongolia in January 2025.

The implementation pace has accelerated since initial entry into force, with the majority of major economies now participating. Notable non-signatories include the United States, which has expressed preference for bilateral approaches, and certain jurisdictions that have pursued alternative implementation through domestic legislation or bilateral protocol negotiations.

#### 6.2. Jurisdictional Variations

Implementation varies significantly across jurisdictions. Some have adopted the MLI comprehensively, listing extensive CTA networks and making minimal reservations. Others have taken more selective approaches, listing limited CTAs or making extensive reservations against optional provisions.

The arbitration provisions illustrate this variation. While the minimum standard measures apply broadly, only approximately 30 jurisdictions have opted into mandatory binding arbitration. This creates a two-tier system where some bilateral relationships include arbitration while others rely solely on MAP.

### 7. Relationship with Bilateral Treaties

The MLI operates as an overlay on existing bilateral treaties rather than replacing them. Understanding this relationship is essential for applying treaty provisions correctly.

Where the MLI modifies a CTA, the relevant MLI provisions must be read together with the underlying treaty. The synthesized text represents how the treaty operates as modified but does not constitute a separate legal instrument. The bilateral treaty and the MLI remain distinct agreements under international law.

This structure preserves jurisdictions' ability to modify their bilateral treaties through subsequent protocols, which may address the MLI relationship explicitly. Some jurisdictions have chosen to incorporate MLI provisions into bilateral treaties through renegotiation, eliminating the need to consult both instruments.

### 8. Practical Implications

#### 8.1. For Tax Authorities

Tax authorities must maintain awareness of MLI positions for all treaty partners. Determining applicable provisions requires consulting both jurisdictions' reservations and notifications, a process significantly more complex than consulting a single bilateral treaty text.

The MLI also affects tax authority procedures. MAP obligations under Article 16 require adjustments to ensure compliance with the minimum standard. Jurisdictions that have adopted arbitration must establish institutional frameworks for participating in arbitration proceedings.

#### 8.2. For Multinational Enterprises

MNEs face increased complexity in treaty planning following MLI implementation. The PPT minimum standard means that arrangements designed primarily to obtain treaty benefits face potential denial. Substance requirements implicit in anti-avoidance provisions require genuine economic presence in jurisdictions through which treaty benefits are claimed. *(covered in June 2024)*

Treaty analysis must now incorporate MLI positions for relevant jurisdictions. Where previously a single bilateral treaty text governed a relationship, practitioners must now synthesize the treaty with applicable MLI provisions, considering both jurisdictions' reservations and notifications.

#### 8.3. For Developing Countries

The MLI provides developing countries access to treaty modernisation that might otherwise require significant bilateral negotiating resources. Participation enables these jurisdictions to implement anti-abuse provisions and improved dispute resolution across their treaty networks efficiently.

However, the complexity of MLI implementation creates capacity challenges. Understanding the interaction between MLI provisions and diverse bilateral treaties requires technical expertise that may be limited in some administrations. Capacity building initiatives through the Inclusive Framework address these challenges, but implementation remains demanding for resource-constrained jurisdictions.

### 9. Current Developments

The MLI continues to evolve as more jurisdictions ratify and as experience accumulates with its operation. Synthesized texts have become increasingly standardised, with many jurisdictions publishing authoritative versions. Interpretive guidance from competent authorities and, eventually, from dispute resolution proceedings will further clarify how provisions operate in practice.

The relationship between the MLI and Pillar Two implementation represents an emerging consideration. As jurisdictions implement the global minimum tax, questions arise regarding the interaction between MLI provisions and new rules on undertaxed profits and qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. These interactions will likely require clarification through additional guidance or, potentially, future amendments to the MLI framework.

The success of the MLI as a mechanism for rapid multilateral implementation has also informed discussions of other multilateral instruments, including the Multilateral Convention to Facilitate the Implementation of Pillar Two Subject to Tax Rule. The MLI established proof of concept for multilateral treaty modification, demonstrating that coordinated implementation across diverse jurisdictions is achievable.
