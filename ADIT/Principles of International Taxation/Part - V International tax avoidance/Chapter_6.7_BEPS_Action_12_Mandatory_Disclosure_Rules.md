## Chapter 6.7: BEPS Action 12 - Mandatory Disclosure Rules

### 1. Introduction to Mandatory Disclosure Rules

BEPS Action 12 addresses mandatory disclosure rules (MDR), which require taxpayers and intermediaries to disclose potentially aggressive tax planning arrangements to tax authorities. The fundamental purpose is to provide tax administrations with early information about tax risks, enabling them to identify and respond to emerging base erosion and profit shifting strategies before such arrangements become widespread.

Unlike several other BEPS Actions, Action 12 is not designated as a minimum standard. Countries are free to decide whether to implement mandatory disclosure regimes based on their specific circumstances, administrative capacity, and policy priorities. This flexibility recognises that mandatory disclosure systems involve trade-offs between the benefits of early information and the compliance burdens imposed on taxpayers and advisers.

The core policy rationale underlying Action 12 is that tax authorities often learn about aggressive tax planning arrangements only years after implementation, typically through audit activities or information exchange. By this point, the arrangements may have been widely adopted, resulting in significant revenue losses that are difficult to recover. Mandatory disclosure rules aim to close this information gap by requiring disclosure at or near the time arrangements are implemented, enabling timely policy responses.

### 2. Historical Context and Policy Rationale

#### 2.1. The 2015 Final Report

The 2015 Final Report on Action 12, titled "Mandatory Disclosure Rules," established a modular framework enabling countries to design disclosure regimes tailored to their specific needs. Rather than prescribing a single mandatory approach, the report provides recommendations and best practices that countries can adapt based on their tax policy objectives and administrative resources.

The report drew upon existing disclosure regimes, particularly those implemented in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, and Canada. These early adopter jurisdictions provided evidence that mandatory disclosure can be an effective tool for obtaining early information about tax planning trends, though the effectiveness depends significantly on regime design.

#### 2.2. Strategic Objectives

Mandatory disclosure rules pursue several interconnected objectives. First, they provide early detection of aggressive tax planning schemes, allowing authorities to assess whether legislative or administrative responses are warranted before arrangements become entrenched. Second, they generate comprehensive data on tax avoidance strategies that can inform future policy development. Third, the existence of disclosure requirements may deter certain aggressive arrangements by increasing the likelihood of scrutiny and the associated reputational risks.

The framework also facilitates international cooperation by enabling tax authorities to share information about disclosed arrangements. This is particularly valuable for cross-border schemes that exploit mismatches between different jurisdictions' tax systems—precisely the type of arrangements targeted by the broader BEPS project.

### 3. The OECD Model Framework

#### 3.1. Modular Design Approach

The OECD model provides a flexible framework that countries can customise based on their specific concerns. The modular approach allows jurisdictions to select which types of arrangements should trigger disclosure obligations, rather than imposing a uniform global standard. This recognises that tax risks vary across jurisdictions depending on their domestic tax systems, treaty networks, and economic characteristics.

The framework identifies two primary categories of disclosure triggers: generic hallmarks that apply broadly across different transaction types, and specific hallmarks targeting known BEPS vulnerabilities. Countries can choose which hallmarks to adopt, combining elements from both categories to create a regime suited to their particular circumstances.

#### 3.2. Dual Threshold Mechanism

The model employs a two-tier approach to determining reportability. The first tier examines whether an arrangement displays one or more hallmark characteristics. The second tier, applicable to certain hallmarks, requires satisfaction of a main benefit test examining whether obtaining a tax advantage is a principal purpose of the arrangement.

This dual threshold mechanism seeks to balance comprehensiveness against over-reporting. Without the main benefit test, many ordinary commercial transactions might technically trigger hallmarks despite having legitimate business purposes. The test filters out arrangements where tax benefits are merely incidental to genuine commercial objectives, focusing disclosure requirements on arrangements where tax minimisation is a driving factor.

### 4. Hallmarks and Reportable Arrangements

#### 4.1. Category A: Generic Hallmarks

Category A encompasses generic hallmarks linked to the main benefit test. These hallmarks identify features commonly associated with marketed tax planning schemes, regardless of the specific tax strategy employed.

Hallmark A.1 addresses confidentiality requirements, where an arrangement is subject to conditions preventing the taxpayer from disclosing how the tax advantage is secured. Such confidentiality obligations may indicate that the arrangement depends on secrecy to remain effective, suggesting potential aggressiveness.

Hallmark A.2 covers premium fee arrangements where intermediary remuneration is contingent upon the tax benefit achieved. Contingent fee structures create incentives for advisers to develop increasingly aggressive positions, making such arrangements appropriate targets for disclosure.

Hallmark A.3 addresses standardised or marketable arrangements that can be implemented for multiple clients with minimal customisation. Mass-marketed schemes present heightened revenue risks because they can be rapidly deployed across numerous taxpayers before authorities become aware of their existence.

#### 4.2. Category B: Specific Hallmarks with Main Benefit Test

Category B contains specific hallmarks that also require satisfaction of the main benefit test. These target particular transaction types known to facilitate profit shifting.

Hallmark B.1 covers loss utilisation schemes involving acquisition of entities or assets with accumulated tax losses. While loss acquisitions can serve legitimate commercial purposes, they may also be structured primarily to obtain tax benefits from losses that would otherwise expire unused.

Hallmark B.2 addresses income conversion arrangements that transform income from one character to another to achieve more favourable tax treatment. Converting ordinary income to capital gains, for example, may reduce tax liability significantly in jurisdictions with preferential capital gains rates.

Hallmark B.3 encompasses circular transactions involving round-tripping of funds that create offsetting or cancelling effects. Such structures may artificially generate deductions or credits without genuine economic substance.

#### 4.3. Category C: Cross-Border Transaction Hallmarks

Category C targets specific cross-border arrangements, with some sub-hallmarks requiring the main benefit test while others trigger automatic disclosure.

Hallmark C.1 covers deductible cross-border payments between associated enterprises where the recipient either has no tax residence, resides in a zero-tax jurisdiction, or benefits from preferential treatment resulting in no or minimal taxation. This hallmark targets base erosion through payments that are deductible in one jurisdiction but not correspondingly taxed elsewhere.

Additional Category C hallmarks address depreciation deductions claimed in multiple jurisdictions, relief from double taxation claimed in multiple jurisdictions without corresponding double inclusion, and asset transfers between associated enterprises with materially different valuations for tax purposes.

#### 4.4. Category D: Automatic Exchange Avoidance

Category D hallmarks address arrangements that undermine automatic exchange of information (AEOI) obligations or obscure beneficial ownership. Unlike Categories A through C, these hallmarks do not require satisfaction of the main benefit test—arrangements matching these hallmarks are automatically reportable.

Hallmark D.1 targets arrangements with the effect of undermining Common Reporting Standard (CRS) reporting obligations. As jurisdictions increasingly rely on automatic information exchange to combat offshore tax evasion, schemes designed to circumvent these requirements represent a significant concern.

Hallmark D.2 addresses arrangements involving legal or beneficial ownership chains designed to obscure beneficial owner identification. Opaque ownership structures frustrate both tax compliance and anti-money laundering objectives.

#### 4.5. Category E: Transfer Pricing Hallmarks

Category E focuses on transfer pricing arrangements, also without requiring the main benefit test. These hallmarks recognise that transfer pricing remains a primary channel for profit shifting.

Hallmark E.1 covers use of unilateral safe harbours not aligned with OECD transfer pricing principles. While safe harbours can reduce compliance burdens, unilateral regimes may facilitate profit shifting if they permit pricing inconsistent with arm's length principles.

Hallmark E.2 addresses transfers of hard-to-value intangibles where reliable comparables are unavailable and future cash flows are highly uncertain. Such transfers present significant valuation challenges that aggressive taxpayers may exploit.

Hallmark E.3 targets intra-group transfers of functions, risks, or assets that are projected to reduce the transferor's earnings before interest and taxes by more than 50 percent over a three-year period. Substantial profit migrations of this magnitude warrant disclosure regardless of transfer pricing methodology employed.

#### 4.6. The Main Benefit Test

The main benefit test serves as a filtering mechanism for hallmarks in Categories A, B, and certain Category C arrangements. The test is satisfied when obtaining a tax advantage is the main benefit, or one of the main benefits, that a person may reasonably expect to derive from the arrangement.

Application of the test requires examination of all relevant facts and circumstances. Tax authorities consider the commercial rationale for the arrangement, the nature and magnitude of expected tax benefits, and whether tax advantages are merely incidental to genuine business purposes. The test sets a relatively high threshold, excluding arrangements where substantive commercial objectives predominate despite the presence of tax benefits.

The main benefit test reflects recognition that tax considerations legitimately influence business decisions. The test does not seek to capture all arrangements with tax consequences, but rather those where tax minimisation is genuinely a principal motivation rather than a secondary consideration.

### 5. Disclosure Obligations

#### 5.1. Who Must Disclose

The OECD model places primary disclosure responsibility on intermediaries, defined as persons who design, market, organise, or make available for implementation a reportable arrangement, or who provide assistance or advice with respect to such arrangements. This category encompasses promoters who create and market schemes as well as service providers who assist with implementation.

Intermediary status is determined by reference to nexus with the reporting jurisdiction. Relevant connecting factors include residence, incorporation, place of management, and operation through a local branch. An intermediary satisfying any of these nexus tests bears disclosure obligations.

Where intermediaries cannot report—typically due to legal professional privilege or absence of nexus—the disclosure obligation shifts to the taxpayer. This secondary obligation ensures that arrangements do not escape disclosure simply because all involved intermediaries are outside the reporting jurisdiction's reach.

#### 5.2. Timing and Reporting Requirements

The standard disclosure window is 30 days from the earliest of three triggering events: the day after the arrangement is made available for implementation, the day after the arrangement is ready for implementation, or the day the first implementation step occurs. This tight timeline reflects the policy objective of obtaining information while arrangements are still being deployed.

For marketable or standardised arrangements, initial disclosure is followed by quarterly updates identifying new users. This ongoing obligation recognises that mass-marketed schemes may be implemented by numerous taxpayers over extended periods.

#### 5.3. Information Required

Disclosure reports must include identification of the arrangement and how it operates, the hallmarks that trigger disclosure, identification of intermediaries and relevant taxpayers, and the tax consequences expected to arise. Where the main benefit test applies, reports should address how that test is satisfied.

### 6. Professional Privilege and Exceptions

#### 6.1. Legal Professional Privilege

The OECD model recognises that mandatory disclosure may conflict with legal professional privilege protecting confidential communications between lawyers and clients. Where such privilege applies under domestic law, intermediaries covered by privilege are not required to disclose privileged information.

However, the scope of this exception has been subject to significant judicial clarification. The privilege applies specifically to lawyers engaged in legal practice, not to all professionals who may be subject to professional secrecy obligations under their regulatory frameworks.

#### 6.2. CJEU Clarifications

Two significant rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2024 clarified the scope of professional privilege under DAC6, the EU's mandatory disclosure directive.

In Case C-623/22 (July 2024), the CJEU confirmed that legal professional privilege under DAC6 applies only to lawyers within the meaning of Directive 98/5/EC governing the legal profession. Other professionals such as accountants, tax consultants, and notaries do not benefit from this exemption, notwithstanding any professional secrecy obligations under their respective regulatory frameworks. These professionals must disclose reportable arrangements despite confidentiality obligations to clients.

Case C-432/23 (September 2024) addressed whether lawyers, though exempt from disclosing arrangement details, must nevertheless notify other intermediaries of their involvement. The CJEU held that requiring such notification would effectively breach the lawyer-client privilege by revealing the very existence of the advisory relationship. Lawyers are therefore exempt from both substantive disclosure and the requirement to notify other intermediaries.

### 7. EU Implementation: DAC6

#### 7.1. Legal Framework

The European Union implemented mandatory disclosure through Council Directive 2018/822, commonly known as DAC6, which amended the Directive on Administrative Cooperation. DAC6 entered into force in June 2018 with reporting obligations generally commencing from July 2020.

DAC6 is more prescriptive than the OECD model framework, establishing specific hallmarks and procedural requirements that all EU member states must implement. This mandatory approach reflects the EU's objective of creating a coordinated disclosure regime across its internal market.

#### 7.2. Coverage and Scope

DAC6 applies to cross-border arrangements involving at least two EU member states, or one EU member state and a third country. The directive adopts hallmark categories substantially aligned with the OECD model, though with some variations in scope and application.

By November 2024, over 60,734 arrangements had been reported to the DAC6 central directory. This substantial volume demonstrates both the breadth of cross-border tax planning activity and the compliance infrastructure that EU member states have established.

#### 7.3. Differences from OECD Model

While DAC6 draws heavily on the OECD framework, several distinctions exist. DAC6 imposes mandatory participation on all EU member states, whereas the OECD model is advisory. The EU directive also includes specific provisions for automatic exchange of disclosed information among member states through a central directory, facilitating coordinated analysis and response.

Member states have implemented DAC6 with some variation. Poland expanded its regime to cover domestic transactions and value added tax. Germany adopted a narrower intermediary definition. Other member states have adhered more closely to the directive's baseline requirements.

### 8. Global Implementation Status

#### 8.1. Jurisdictions with MDR

According to the OECD Corporate Tax Statistics 2025, 31 jurisdictions have implemented mandatory disclosure rules. The majority are European Union member states complying with DAC6, but several non-EU jurisdictions have also adopted MDR regimes.

The United Kingdom transitioned from DAC6 to a domestic MDR regime following its departure from the European Union. Mexico introduced mandatory disclosure through tax reform in 2020. Other jurisdictions including Korea and Israel have established disclosure frameworks, while several additional countries have legislation under consideration.

#### 8.2. International Coordination

Beyond individual country regimes, international coordination mechanisms facilitate information sharing on disclosed arrangements. The OECD's International Exchange Framework for Mandatory Disclosure Rules provides a multilateral basis for exchanging information about CRS avoidance arrangements and opaque offshore structures.

Participating jurisdictions include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, among others. This coordination extends the reach of mandatory disclosure beyond individual countries' enforcement capacity.

### 9. Current Developments

#### 9.1. Recent Statistics

The Corporate Tax Statistics 2025 edition represents the first OECD publication incorporating MDR implementation data. The 31 jurisdictions with disclosure regimes in place reflect steady expansion since the 2015 recommendations, though implementation remains concentrated in Europe.

The substantial volume of DAC6 disclosures provides tax authorities with unprecedented visibility into cross-border tax planning. Analysis of reported arrangements informs both individual compliance activities and broader policy development.

#### 9.2. Emerging Trends

Recent developments suggest continued evolution of mandatory disclosure regimes. DAC8, adopted by the EU, strengthens reporting requirements by mandating arrangement summaries and additional information to assist tax authority risk assessment. This enhancement reflects experience gained from initial DAC6 implementation.

Integration of mandatory disclosure with other transparency initiatives is also advancing. Coordination between MDR reporting and country-by-country reporting under Action 13 enables more comprehensive analysis of multinational enterprise tax positions. The relationship between MDR and Pillar Two's global minimum tax may prompt further development as jurisdictions assess how disclosure regimes interact with the new international tax architecture.

### 10. Practical Implications

For intermediaries, mandatory disclosure creates significant operational requirements. The 30-day reporting window demands systems capable of identifying reportable arrangements promptly. Hallmark assessment requires detailed analysis of each arrangement against multiple criteria, with particular attention to the main benefit test where applicable.

For taxpayers, disclosure regimes increase transparency of tax planning activities. Arrangements that might previously have remained private until audit are now visible to tax authorities at or near implementation. This enhanced transparency may influence risk appetite for aggressive positions, as disclosed arrangements face heightened probability of scrutiny.

The interaction between disclosure obligations and professional privilege requires careful navigation. Following the 2024 CJEU clarifications, only lawyers benefit from privilege protections. Other advisers must disclose despite professional confidentiality obligations, shifting sensitive reporting decisions to client taxpayers where lawyer involvement exists.

Multinational enterprises operating across multiple jurisdictions face particular complexity, as the same arrangement may trigger disclosure obligations in several countries with differing hallmark interpretations and procedural requirements. Coordinated compliance approaches and centralised tracking systems help manage these multi-jurisdictional obligations effectively.
