## Chapter 6.2: Overview of All BEPS Actions

### 1. Introduction and Types of BEPS Outputs

The BEPS Action Plan comprises fifteen distinct actions addressing different aspects of base erosion and profit shifting. These actions are organised around the three pillars of coherence, substance, and transparency discussed in Chapter 6.1. Understanding the different types of outputs produced by each action is essential, as these determine the implementation requirements for participating jurisdictions.

The BEPS Project produced four categories of output. Minimum standards represent binding commitments that all Inclusive Framework members must implement, subject to peer review monitoring. Four actions fall into this category: Actions 5, 6, 13, and 14. Common approaches facilitate convergence of national practices while allowing flexibility in implementation details. Best practice recommendations draw on member country experiences without creating mandatory obligations. Finally, some actions produced guidance and analytical frameworks to support implementation of other measures. This tiered structure reflects the varying degrees of consensus achievable across diverse tax systems and recognises that some BEPS risks require coordinated global action while others may be addressed through national measures.

### 2. Coherence Actions

The coherence pillar addresses gaps and mismatches between different countries' tax systems that create opportunities for double non-taxation. Actions 2, 3, and 4 focus on strengthening domestic rules to prevent such outcomes.

#### 2.1. Action 2: Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements

Hybrid mismatch arrangements exploit differences in how countries characterise entities or financial instruments to achieve double non-taxation. A payment might be deductible in one jurisdiction while the corresponding receipt is not taxable in another, or the same expense might be deductible in two jurisdictions simultaneously.

Action 2 developed linking rules to neutralise these mismatches. The primary rule operates in the payer jurisdiction, denying the deduction where a corresponding inclusion does not occur in the payee jurisdiction. Where the primary rule does not apply, a defensive rule requires the payee jurisdiction to include the payment in income. These rules address deduction/no inclusion outcomes, double deduction outcomes, and imported mismatches where the benefit of a hybrid arrangement is transferred to a third jurisdiction. The recommendations also cover reverse hybrids, branch mismatches, and dual resident entities. Action 2 represents a common approach, meaning jurisdictions are expected to implement consistent rules though the precise legislative drafting may vary. *(covered in December 2024)*

#### 2.2. Action 3: Controlled Foreign Company Rules

Controlled foreign company rules prevent taxpayers from shifting income to foreign subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. Without effective CFC rules, a parent company could accumulate passive income in a controlled foreign subsidiary indefinitely, deferring domestic tax liability.

Action 3 provides building blocks for effective CFC legislation rather than a single prescribed approach. These include defining what constitutes a controlled foreign company, establishing appropriate threshold requirements, identifying which income should be attributed to shareholders, computing the attributed income, and providing mechanisms to prevent double taxation when income is eventually distributed. The recommendations recognise that countries may legitimately differ in their policy objectives and that CFC rules must balance revenue protection against competitiveness concerns. Action 3 represents best practices, allowing jurisdictions considerable flexibility in design and implementation.

#### 2.3. Action 4: Interest Deductions

Excessive interest deductions represent one of the most significant BEPS risks. Multinational enterprises can reduce taxable profits in high-tax jurisdictions by loading those entities with intercompany debt, with interest payments flowing to group entities in low-tax jurisdictions.

Action 4 recommends limiting net interest deductions to a fixed percentage of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. The recommended corridor is 10 to 30 percent of EBITDA, providing countries flexibility to set rates reflecting their policy priorities. A group ratio rule allows entities that are part of highly leveraged groups to deduct interest up to the group's net third-party interest ratio, recognising that some businesses legitimately require substantial debt financing. The recommendations also address specific risks in banking and insurance sectors and provide for targeted anti-avoidance rules. Action 4 represents a common approach, facilitating convergence while accommodating different economic circumstances. *(covered in December 2024)*

### 3. Substance Actions

The substance pillar ensures that taxing rights align with economic activity and value creation. Actions 5 through 10 address artificial arrangements that separate taxable profits from the locations where genuine economic activities occur.

#### 3.1. Action 5: Harmful Tax Practices

Action 5 addresses harmful tax competition through two complementary mechanisms. The first requires that preferential tax regimes, particularly those providing benefits for intellectual property income, include substantial activity requirements. The nexus approach permits reduced taxation on intellectual property (IP) income only where the taxpayer has undertaken qualifying research and development activities generating that income. This prevents arrangements where IP is held in low-tax jurisdictions without corresponding development activities.

The second mechanism enhances transparency through mandatory spontaneous exchange of information on taxpayer-specific tax rulings. Jurisdictions must identify and exchange information on rulings relating to preferential regimes, cross-border unilateral advance pricing agreements, permanent establishment determinations, related party conduit arrangements, and any other rulings that might give rise to BEPS concerns. As a minimum standard, Action 5 is subject to peer review, with the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices monitoring implementation. Over 300 preferential regimes have been reviewed, with the majority amended or abolished to meet substance requirements. *(covered in June 2023)*

#### 3.2. Action 6: Treaty Abuse Prevention

Treaty shopping occurs when residents of third countries obtain treaty benefits by routing investments through entities established in treaty partner jurisdictions. This undermines the bilateral nature of tax treaties and reduces source country tax revenues below intended levels.

Action 6 established a minimum standard requiring treaties to include explicit anti-abuse provisions. The principal purpose test denies treaty benefits where obtaining those benefits was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement. The limitation on benefits clause takes an objective approach, restricting benefits to entities meeting specific requirements regarding ownership, activities, or other characteristics. Countries may adopt either approach or both in combination. Treaties must also include preamble language clarifying that the contracting states intend to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. Implementation has been extensive, with over 1,360 bilateral agreements now complying with the minimum standard, many modified through the Multilateral Instrument.

#### 3.3. Action 7: Permanent Establishment Status

Some multinational enterprises structured their affairs to avoid permanent establishment status in market jurisdictions despite substantial economic presence. Commissionaire arrangements, where a local entity acts as agent but does not formally conclude contracts, were particularly common.

Action 7 expands the permanent establishment definition to capture such arrangements. The revised agency permanent establishment rule applies where a person habitually concludes contracts or plays the principal role leading to contract conclusion, even without formal authority to bind the foreign enterprise. The specific activity exemptions in Article 5(4) of the OECD Model now include an anti-fragmentation rule ensuring that activities remain exempt only when genuinely preparatory or auxiliary. Related party activities must be viewed in combination to prevent artificial splitting of functions to maintain exemptions. These changes have been incorporated into the Multilateral Instrument and are being implemented through bilateral treaty modifications.

#### 3.4. Actions 8-10: Transfer Pricing and Value Creation

Actions 8, 9, and 10 revised the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines to ensure that transfer pricing outcomes align with value creation rather than merely reflecting contractual arrangements.

Action 8 addresses intangibles, adopting a broad definition encompassing assets that are not physical or financial but may generate future economic benefits. The DEMPE framework requires analysing which entities perform development, enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation functions with respect to intangibles. Legal ownership alone does not determine entitlement to returns; entities must perform relevant functions, use assets, and assume risks to be allocated income from intangibles.

Action 9 addresses risks and capital, ensuring that entities bearing contractual risks must have the capacity to control those risks and the financial capacity to assume them. Funding entities that merely provide capital without performing significant functions receive only risk-free returns.

Action 10 addresses other high-risk transactions including management fees, head office expenses, and commodity transactions. These revisions have been incorporated into the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and inform transfer pricing analysis globally.

### 4. Transparency Actions

The transparency pillar provides tax authorities with better information to assess BEPS risks and ensures taxpayers understand their obligations. Actions 11 through 14 enhance information flows between taxpayers and tax authorities and between tax authorities themselves.

#### 4.1. Action 11: Measuring and Monitoring BEPS

Policy makers cannot effectively address problems they cannot measure. Before the BEPS Project, estimates of revenue losses from profit shifting varied widely, undermining the case for coordinated international action. Effective policy responses require reliable data on the scale and nature of BEPS. Action 11 developed methodologies for collecting and analysing data to measure BEPS and monitor the effectiveness of countermeasures over time. The OECD publishes regular analyses using corporate tax statistics, country-by-country reporting data, and other sources to assess whether BEPS behaviours are diminishing following implementation of the Action Plan.

#### 4.2. Action 12: Mandatory Disclosure Rules

Early identification of aggressive tax planning arrangements enables tax authorities to respond promptly. Action 12 provides recommendations for mandatory disclosure regimes requiring taxpayers or advisors to report potentially aggressive arrangements. Key features include defining hallmarks that trigger disclosure requirements, establishing clear reporting obligations, and providing appropriate penalties for non-compliance. The recommendations represent best practices rather than a minimum standard, reflecting different constitutional and legal traditions regarding disclosure obligations.

#### 4.3. Action 13: Country-by-Country Reporting

Action 13 established a three-tiered transfer pricing documentation structure providing tax authorities with comprehensive information on multinational enterprise operations. The master file provides an overview of the group's global business, organisational structure, intangibles, intercompany financial activities, and financial and tax positions. The local file contains detailed documentation demonstrating arm's length pricing for transactions affecting the local entity.

The country-by-country report requires multinational enterprise groups with consolidated revenue of €750 million or more to report key financial and tax information for each jurisdiction where they operate. This includes revenues from related and unrelated parties, profit or loss before tax, income tax paid and accrued, stated capital, accumulated earnings, number of employees, and tangible assets. Reports are exchanged automatically between tax authorities through bilateral agreements. This standardised reporting enables tax authorities to identify misalignments between where profits are reported and where economic activities occur, facilitating targeted risk assessment rather than resource-intensive comprehensive audits. As a minimum standard, Action 13 is subject to peer review. Over three-quarters of Inclusive Framework jurisdictions have implemented country-by-country reporting requirements.

#### 4.4. Action 14: Dispute Resolution

Effective dispute resolution mechanisms are essential as BEPS measures increase potential for international tax disputes. Action 14 commits jurisdictions to make mutual agreement procedures (MAP) more effective by ensuring treaty obligations are implemented in good faith, administrative processes promote prevention and timely resolution of disputes, and taxpayers can access MAP when eligible.

The minimum standard includes a target of resolving MAP cases within an average of 24 months. Best practices encourage jurisdictions to adopt mandatory binding arbitration for unresolved cases, though this remains optional. The peer review process monitors compliance and has driven significant improvements in MAP access and timeliness across participating jurisdictions.

### 5. Digital Economy and Implementation

#### 5.1. Action 1: Digital Economy Challenges

Action 1 examined tax challenges arising from digitalisation, identifying issues including the ability of businesses to have significant economic presence without physical presence, the value created by user participation and data, and characterisation challenges for new business models. The report concluded that the digital economy could not be ring-fenced from the broader economy, as digitalisation increasingly pervades all sectors.

These challenges proved sufficiently complex that they were subsequently addressed through the Two-Pillar Solution developed from 2019 onwards. Pillar One creates new taxing rights for market jurisdictions over profits of the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises. Pillar Two establishes a global minimum tax of 15 percent for large multinational enterprise groups. This evolution demonstrates how the BEPS Project continues to adapt to emerging challenges.

#### 5.2. Action 15: The Multilateral Instrument

Implementing treaty-related BEPS measures through bilateral renegotiation of thousands of existing treaties would have taken decades. Action 15 developed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, enabling jurisdictions to modify their bilateral treaties simultaneously.

The Multilateral Instrument covers treaty-related measures from Actions 2, 6, 7, and 14. Jurisdictions designate which bilateral treaties they wish to modify and select from available options for each provision. The instrument entered into force in July 2018 and now has 104 signatories, modifying approximately 1,400 bilateral tax treaties. This represents an unprecedented achievement in international tax cooperation, demonstrating that multilateral solutions to bilateral treaty networks are achievable.
