## Chapter 2.1: CFC and Other Controlled Foreign Entity Legislation – Examples from State Practice

### 1. Policy Rationale and International Framework

#### 1.1. The Problem of Deferral

Controlled foreign company (CFC) legislation addresses a fundamental challenge in international taxation: the potential for resident taxpayers to defer domestic taxation indefinitely by accumulating income in foreign subsidiaries located in low-tax jurisdictions. Without CFC rules, a resident company could establish a subsidiary in a jurisdiction with minimal taxation, direct mobile income to that subsidiary, and avoid home country tax until dividends were eventually repatriated—a possibility that might never occur.

The policy rationale for CFC rules rests on the principle that residence countries should be able to tax their residents on worldwide income, including income earned through controlled foreign entities. By attributing certain categories of income to domestic shareholders regardless of actual distribution, CFC rules neutralise the deferral advantage while maintaining the legal distinction between parent and subsidiary as separate entities.

#### 1.2. BEPS Action 3 Recommendations

The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project addressed CFC rules in Action 3, which set out recommended approaches to ensure taxation of certain multinational enterprise income in the jurisdiction of the parent company. The recommendations recognised that effective CFC rules reduce incentives for profit shifting by ensuring that income diverted to low-tax subsidiaries faces taxation at the parent level (covered in June 2024).

Action 3 identified six building blocks for effective CFC rules: the definition of a CFC, including control and exemptions; the CFC exemptions and threshold requirements; the definition of CFC income; the computation of income; rules for attributing income; and provisions to prevent or eliminate double taxation. While BEPS Action 3 was not designated a minimum standard, it provided a framework that has influenced domestic reforms and the EU's mandatory CFC requirements.

### 2. Key Design Elements

#### 2.1. Control Tests

CFC legislation requires determination of when a foreign company is sufficiently controlled by domestic residents to justify attribution of its income. Jurisdictions employ various control tests, including legal control based on shareholding, economic control examining rights to profits or assets, and de facto control assessing practical influence over decision-making.

The control threshold typically ranges from forty to fifty percent, though approaches vary. Some jurisdictions apply a bright-line test based solely on voting power or value, while others incorporate more nuanced assessments of whether domestic residents effectively control the foreign entity. The choice between concentrated control tests and those capturing more dispersed ownership reflects different policy judgments about when attribution is justified.

#### 2.2. Income Definitions

Jurisdictions differ significantly in which categories of CFC income trigger domestic taxation. The distinction between passive and active income is fundamental: passive income includes dividends, interest, royalties, and rental income that can easily be directed to any location, while active income derives from genuine business operations requiring local presence.

Some regimes apply CFC rules only to passive income, reasoning that active business income reflects genuine economic activity that should be taxed where it occurs. Others apply rules to both active and passive income when earned through entities in low-tax jurisdictions, on the view that any income booked in tax havens likely results from artificial arrangements rather than commercial substance.

#### 2.3. Low-Tax Thresholds

CFC rules typically include a mechanism for identifying when a foreign subsidiary is subject to sufficiently low taxation to warrant application of the rules. This may take the form of a specified effective tax rate threshold, a comparison to the domestic rate, or identification of listed low-tax jurisdictions.

The threshold level varies considerably. Some jurisdictions apply a fixed percentage—commonly between fifteen and twenty-five percent—while others apply rules where the foreign tax is less than a specified proportion (such as fifty or seventy-five percent) of what would have been paid domestically. The global minimum tax rate of fifteen percent under Pillar Two has prompted some jurisdictions to align their CFC thresholds accordingly.

### 3. United States Approach

#### 3.1. Subpart F Regime

The United States pioneered CFC legislation with Subpart F, enacted in 1962. A CFC under US law is a foreign corporation in which US shareholders collectively own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value on any day during the taxable year. US shareholders—defined as US persons owning at least ten percent—must include their pro rata share of the CFC's Subpart F income in their gross income regardless of distribution.

Subpart F income encompasses several categories of easily movable passive income: foreign personal holding company income (dividends, interest, rents, royalties), foreign base company sales income, and foreign base company services income. The rules apply where income is earned through structures designed to separate income from the location of economic activity, such as purchasing goods from a related party and selling to third parties outside the CFC's country of incorporation.

#### 3.2. GILTI and Recent Developments

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 introduced Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), which requires US shareholders of CFCs to include their share of CFC income exceeding a deemed return on tangible assets. Unlike Subpart F, GILTI applies to active business income, though a deduction mechanism reduces the effective rate to approximately 10.5 percent for corporate shareholders.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 renamed GILTI as Net CFC Tested Income and reduced the deduction from fifty to forty percent, increasing the effective rate to 12.6 percent. The legislation also made permanent the Subpart F look-through rules for CFC-to-CFC payments and eliminated the qualified business asset investment reduction, strengthening the regime's anti-avoidance effect while responding to the global minimum tax framework.

### 4. United Kingdom Approach

#### 4.1. TIOPA 2010 Framework

The United Kingdom's CFC rules, contained in the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010, apply to companies resident outside the UK but controlled by UK residents. Control is established through shareholding control, economic control, or accounting control as a parent undertaking. A CFC charge arises only where a UK company holds at least a twenty-five percent interest in the subsidiary.

The UK regime is notable for its gateway approach: rather than attributing all CFC income, only profits that have passed through one of five gateways are chargeable. These gateways address profits attributable to UK activities, non-trading finance profits, trading finance profits connected with UK-managed arrangements, captive insurance income, and profits from exploiting UK-acquired intellectual property.

#### 4.2. Exemptions and Safe Harbours

The UK provides several entity-level exemptions that exclude a CFC from the regime entirely. The excluded territories exemption applies where the CFC is resident in a jurisdiction specified in regulations and earns limited amounts of specified income. The low profits exemption applies where accounting profits do not exceed £500,000 or the CFC charge would not exceed £50,000. The tax exemption applies where local tax equals at least seventy-five percent of corresponding UK tax.

These exemptions reflect a policy choice to limit the CFC regime's application to situations presenting genuine base erosion risks, reducing compliance burdens for multinationals with subsidiaries in mainstream jurisdictions conducting legitimate business activities.

### 5. Germany Approach

#### 5.1. Hinzurechnungsbesteuerung

Germany's CFC rules date to 1972 and are contained in the Foreign Tax Act (Außensteuergesetz). The rules apply where German residents directly or indirectly hold more than fifty percent of a foreign company's capital or voting rights at fiscal year end. Unlike jurisdictions that focus on passive income, Germany's regime potentially applies to all income of low-taxed foreign entities.

A foreign company is considered low-taxed where it is subject to an effective tax rate below fifteen percent—a threshold reduced from twenty-five percent by the Minimum Tax Directive Implementation Act to align with Pillar Two. Passive income of such entities is attributed to German shareholders and taxed in Germany, with credit available for foreign taxes paid.

#### 5.2. ATAD Implementation

Germany amended its CFC rules through the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive Implementation Act of 2021, which introduced a shareholder-related approach and abolished the concept of downstream intermediary companies. The reforms also aligned the substance requirements with EU jurisprudence, recognising that CFC rules applying to EU subsidiaries must accommodate the freedom of establishment where the subsidiary conducts genuine economic activity (covered in June 2023).

### 6. Australia Approach

#### 6.1. Active Income Test

Australia's CFC provisions, introduced in 1991 under Part X of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, apply where Australian residents control a foreign company through one of three tests: the strict control test requiring five or fewer Australian entities with fifty percent control, the assumed controller test for single entities with forty percent control, or the de facto control test.

The distinguishing feature of Australia's regime is the active income test exemption. Where a CFC derives less than five percent of its gross turnover as tainted income—comprising passive income, tainted sales income, and tainted services income—the attribution rules do not apply. This test recognises that CFCs genuinely conducting active business operations abroad should not be subject to accruals taxation merely because of Australian control.

#### 6.2. Listed and Unlisted Countries

Australia maintains a list of seven countries—Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States—where CFCs receive favourable treatment. For CFCs in listed countries, attribution applies only to eligible designated concession income, whereas CFCs in unlisted countries face attribution on all tainted income. This distinction reflects judgments about tax system comparability and the likelihood that income booked in particular jurisdictions represents artificial profit shifting.

### 7. Japan Approach

Japan's CFC rules, introduced in 1978 and substantially revised in 2017 following BEPS recommendations, employ a two-tier structure with different trigger tax rates. Entity-based aggregation applies where a CFC is classified as a paper company, cash box company, or located in a blacklisted jurisdiction, with all income attributed to Japanese shareholders unless the effective foreign tax rate exceeds twenty-seven percent (reduced from thirty percent for fiscal years beginning after April 2024).

Income-based aggregation applies to CFCs not caught by entity-based rules but earning certain passive income categories, with a twenty percent trigger rate. This dual approach allows Japan to apply stringent rules to shell companies while limiting attribution for entities with genuine substance that earn primarily active income. The distinction between paper companies and those with economic activity reflects the substance over form principles central to modern anti-avoidance regimes.

### 8. EU ATAD Framework

The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) of 2016 required all EU Member States to implement CFC rules by January 2019. The Directive offers two models: Model A applies entity-based aggregation where the CFC pays less than half the tax it would pay domestically and derives primarily passive income; Model B applies a transactional approach targeting specific categories of non-genuine arrangements lacking economic substance.

Member States have implemented these requirements with considerable variation. The Netherlands applies Model A to CFCs in low-taxed jurisdictions or those on the EU non-cooperative jurisdiction list. Belgium shifted from Model B to Model A from 2024, applying an entity approach that taxes non-distributed profits where the CFC is subject to an effective rate below fifteen percent. Italy applies Model B with a passive income test, while Poland has developed a hybrid model with different definitions and computation rules depending on circumstances (covered in June 2025).
