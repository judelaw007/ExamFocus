## Chapter 3: Application of Money-Laundering Legislation to Foreign Fiscal Offences

The intersection of money-laundering legislation and international taxation represents a significant development in the global effort to combat tax evasion. By treating tax crimes as predicate offences for money laundering, jurisdictions have created powerful new enforcement mechanisms that extend across borders.

### 1. The Concept of Predicate Offences

#### 1.1. Definition and Significance

A predicate offence is a crime that generates proceeds which are subsequently laundered. Money laundering itself involves disguising the origins of criminally obtained funds to make them appear legitimate. The concept is fundamental because the prosecution of money laundering depends on establishing that the funds in question derive from a predicate offence.

Traditionally, money laundering legislation focused on proceeds from serious crimes such as drug trafficking, corruption, and organized crime. The rationale was that these offences generated substantial illicit funds that criminals sought to integrate into the legitimate financial system. Tax crimes, by contrast, were often viewed as regulatory matters rather than serious criminal offences, and were not universally recognized as predicate offences.

#### 1.2. Tax Crimes as Predicate Offences

The treatment of tax crimes as predicate offences for money laundering represents a significant policy shift. When tax evasion constitutes a predicate offence, the laundering of evaded taxes becomes a separate criminal act. This approach enables authorities to pursue not only the underlying tax crime but also anyone who assists in concealing the proceeds.

This development has profound implications for cross-border enforcement. Where tax evasion in one jurisdiction generates funds that are subsequently moved to another, authorities in the receiving jurisdiction may prosecute money laundering even if the underlying tax offence occurred elsewhere. This effectively extends the enforcement reach of tax authorities beyond their territorial boundaries.

### 2. International Framework

#### 2.1. FATF Recommendations

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is the intergovernmental body that sets international standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. In 2012, FATF revised its Recommendations to include tax crimes as designated predicate offences, covering both direct taxes and indirect taxes. This revision marked a watershed moment in international tax enforcement.

Prior to 2012, the inclusion of tax crimes was left to the discretion of individual jurisdictions. Some countries classified tax evasion as a predicate offence while others did not, creating inconsistency in the global anti-money laundering framework. The 2012 revision established a clear international expectation that tax crimes should be treated equivalently to other serious offences such as fraud and corruption.

The FATF Recommendations now list tax crimes (related to direct taxes and indirect taxes) among twenty-one designated categories of predicate offences. Jurisdictions are expected to implement these standards and are subject to mutual evaluations to assess their compliance.

#### 2.2. OECD Ten Global Principles

The OECD has complemented the FATF framework through its Ten Global Principles for Fighting Tax Crime, first published in 2017 and elevated to a Council Recommendation in 2022. Principle 7 specifically recommends that jurisdictions should make tax crimes a predicate offence for money laundering.

The OECD approach emphasizes the connection between tax crime enforcement and broader financial crime frameworks. Tax authorities are encouraged to cooperate with financial intelligence units and other law enforcement agencies, sharing information and coordinating investigations. This whole-of-government approach recognizes that tax crimes often intersect with other forms of financial crime.

### 3. EU Implementation

#### 3.1. Anti-Money Laundering Directives

The European Union has implemented the FATF standards through successive Anti-Money Laundering Directives. The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4th AMLD), adopted in 2015, incorporated tax crimes as predicate offences following the FATF revision. This represented the first explicit inclusion of tax crimes at the EU level.

The Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (6th AMLD), published in 2018 with an implementation deadline of December 2020, further harmonized the definition of money laundering across EU member states. It established a list of twenty-two predicate offences that must be criminalized in all member states, explicitly including tax crimes related to both direct and indirect taxes.

#### 3.2. Harmonization and Dual Criminality

The 6th AMLD addresses the principle of dual criminality, which requires that an act be criminal in both the jurisdiction where the predicate offence occurred and the jurisdiction where the laundering takes place. The directive requires member states to criminalize certain predicate offences regardless of whether they are illegal in their own jurisdiction, ensuring that differences in domestic law do not create enforcement gaps.

However, the directive does not harmonize the definition of tax crimes themselves, leaving member states to define what constitutes a tax offence under their domestic law. This creates some variation in practical application across the EU.

### 4. Practical Implications for International Taxation

#### 4.1. Enhanced Enforcement Cooperation

The classification of tax crimes as predicate offences has enhanced cooperation between tax authorities and anti-money laundering agencies. Financial institutions are now required to report suspicious transactions that may involve proceeds of tax evasion, creating an additional source of intelligence for tax authorities.

This development complements other transparency initiatives such as the Common Reporting Standard and country-by-country reporting. Together, these mechanisms create a comprehensive framework for detecting and deterring cross-border tax evasion (covered in December 2023).

#### 4.2. Jurisdictional Considerations

Not all jurisdictions have implemented these standards uniformly. The United States, notably, has not designated tax crimes as predicate offences for federal money laundering statutes, though some states have done so. This creates complexity in international enforcement, as the availability of money laundering charges depends on the jurisdictions involved.

For practitioners and taxpayers, the implications are significant. Aggressive tax planning that crosses into evasion may now expose not only the taxpayer but also advisers and financial institutions to money laundering liability in jurisdictions that recognize tax crimes as predicate offences.
