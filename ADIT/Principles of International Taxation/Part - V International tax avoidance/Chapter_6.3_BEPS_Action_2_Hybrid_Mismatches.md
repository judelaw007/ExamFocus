## Chapter 6.3: BEPS Action 2 - Hybrid Mismatches

### 1. Introduction to Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements

Hybrid mismatch arrangements exploit differences in how two or more jurisdictions characterise entities, instruments, or transactions to achieve tax advantages that would not be available under either jurisdiction's rules applied in isolation. These arrangements typically produce one of two outcomes: a deduction for a payment in one jurisdiction without corresponding taxation of the receipt in another jurisdiction, or deductions for the same expense in multiple jurisdictions. The fundamental concern is that such arrangements undermine the integrity of domestic tax systems by enabling taxpayers to achieve double non-taxation through careful structuring rather than genuine economic activity.

The scale of potential revenue loss from hybrid arrangements prompted the G20 to include this issue as a priority in the BEPS Action Plan. BEPS Action 2 addresses these concerns through recommendations for both domestic law changes and modifications to the OECD Model Tax Convention. The approach recognises that hybrid mismatches arise from the interaction of different national tax systems rather than from any single jurisdiction's rules, and that effective solutions therefore require coordinated international action.

Understanding why these arrangements create policy concerns requires appreciating that international tax rules traditionally developed on the assumption that income would be taxed at least once. Double taxation relief mechanisms, including tax treaties, were designed to prevent the same income being taxed twice while assuming that at least one jurisdiction would exercise taxing rights. Hybrid arrangements exploit gaps in this framework by creating situations where no jurisdiction taxes the income, or where multiple deductions shelter income from taxation anywhere.

### 2. Types of Mismatch Outcomes

#### 2.1. Deduction/No Inclusion Outcomes

A deduction/no inclusion outcome occurs when a payment is deductible in the payer jurisdiction but the corresponding receipt is not included in the taxable income of the recipient jurisdiction. This mismatch exploits differences in how jurisdictions characterise the payment or the entities involved.

The most common example involves hybrid financial instruments that one jurisdiction treats as debt while another treats as equity. The payer jurisdiction allows a deduction for interest payments, while the recipient jurisdiction treats the receipt as an exempt dividend. Neither jurisdiction's domestic law is defective in isolation; the policy mismatch arises only because the two systems interact in an uncoordinated manner.

Deduction/no inclusion outcomes can also arise from differences in entity classification. A payment to an entity that the payer jurisdiction treats as a separate taxable person may not be taxed if the recipient jurisdiction treats that entity as transparent, attributing the income to owners who are not themselves taxable on the receipt.

#### 2.2. Double Deduction Outcomes

A double deduction outcome occurs when the same expense generates deductions in two jurisdictions. This typically arises when an entity is treated as a resident taxpayer in two jurisdictions, or when a transparent entity structure allows the same expense to be deducted at both the entity level in one jurisdiction and the owner level in another.

Dual resident entities can create double deduction outcomes when both residence jurisdictions allow deductions for the same expenditure against different income streams. Similarly, structures involving transparent entities may enable an expense incurred by the entity to be deducted against income in the entity's jurisdiction while also being allocated to owners who deduct it against their income in another jurisdiction.

The revenue impact of double deduction arrangements can be substantial because they effectively halve the pre-tax cost of an expense, providing a significant commercial advantage to taxpayers able to implement such structures compared with those operating purely domestic arrangements.

### 3. The BEPS Action 2 Framework

#### 3.1. Objectives and Approach

BEPS Action 2 aims to neutralise the tax effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements by ensuring that such arrangements do not result in double non-taxation. The approach does not seek to harmonise the underlying domestic laws that give rise to mismatches, recognising that such harmonisation would face insurmountable sovereignty concerns. Instead, it introduces linking rules that adjust one jurisdiction's tax treatment based on the outcome in another jurisdiction.

The linking rules operate to deny a benefit that would otherwise arise from the mismatch. For deduction/no inclusion outcomes, the rules either deny the deduction or require inclusion of the payment in income. For double deduction outcomes, the rules limit or deny one of the deductions. The objective is to ensure that the combined effect of the rules in both jurisdictions achieves single taxation of the income, aligning with the policy intent underlying both systems.

This approach represents a significant evolution in international tax coordination. Rather than requiring countries to change their fundamental approach to characterising entities or instruments, the linking rules add a coordination layer that adjusts outcomes when mismatches would otherwise occur. This preserves national sovereignty over tax policy while addressing the cross-border consequences of policy differences.

#### 3.2. Primary and Defensive Rules

The BEPS Action 2 recommendations establish a hierarchy of responses to ensure consistent outcomes regardless of the order in which jurisdictions apply their rules. The primary rule assigns responsibility to one jurisdiction, with a defensive rule applying in the other jurisdiction only if the primary rule is not applied.

For deduction/no inclusion outcomes, the primary rule denies the deduction in the payer jurisdiction. This reflects the principle that the jurisdiction providing the tax benefit through the deduction should bear responsibility for ensuring appropriate coordination. If the payer jurisdiction does not apply the primary rule, the defensive rule requires the payee jurisdiction to include the payment in income.

For double deduction outcomes, the primary rule denies the deduction in the parent or investor jurisdiction. If this jurisdiction does not act, the defensive rule denies the deduction in the other jurisdiction. This hierarchy ensures that at least one jurisdiction adjusts its treatment, preventing the mismatch from persisting simply because jurisdictions act independently.

The ordering of rules matters because it determines which jurisdiction bears the compliance burden and administrative cost of adjustment. By establishing clear priority, the recommendations reduce the risk of both jurisdictions adjusting their treatment and thereby creating unintended double taxation. *(covered in December 2024)*

### 4. Categories of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements

The BEPS Action 2 recommendations address several distinct categories of hybrid arrangement, each exploiting different types of cross-border characterisation differences. Understanding these categories is essential because the specific rules and their application vary depending on the source of the mismatch, and because different jurisdictions have implemented rules addressing different categories with varying scope and timing.

#### 4.1. Hybrid Financial Instruments

Hybrid financial instruments possess characteristics of both debt and equity, leading different jurisdictions to classify them differently for tax purposes. An instrument might provide for returns that vary with profitability while also creating an obligation of repayment, causing one jurisdiction to treat it as equity and another as debt.

The mismatch arises because debt characterisation typically leads to deductible interest payments, while equity characterisation may result in exempt dividend receipts under participation exemption regimes. Structuring finance arrangements using such instruments can achieve deductions in the borrower jurisdiction while the lender receives tax-exempt income.

Action 2 addresses financial instrument mismatches by requiring the payer jurisdiction to deny the deduction to the extent the payment is not included in income in the payee jurisdiction due to the hybrid character of the instrument. This requires knowledge of how the recipient jurisdiction treats the payment, creating compliance complexity but ensuring the mismatch is neutralised.

#### 4.2. Hybrid Entity Mismatches

Hybrid entities are treated as separate taxable entities in one jurisdiction but as transparent or disregarded in another. This difference can generate mismatches when payments to or from the entity are treated differently by the two jurisdictions.

A payment to a hybrid entity may be deductible in the payer jurisdiction but not included in the entity's income if the recipient jurisdiction treats the entity as transparent and the payment is not taxable at the owner level. Conversely, payments from a hybrid entity may create deductions that are not matched by income inclusion anywhere if the jurisdictions differ on whether the entity or its owners should be treated as making the payment.

The recommendations address hybrid entity mismatches through the same primary and defensive rule structure. The payer jurisdiction has primary responsibility to deny deductions that would create deduction/no inclusion outcomes, with the defensive rule requiring income inclusion if the primary rule is not applied.

#### 4.3. Reverse Hybrid Entities

Reverse hybrid mismatches arise from the opposite situation: an entity treated as transparent in the jurisdiction where it is established but as a separate taxable entity in the owner's jurisdiction. This structure can create deduction/no inclusion outcomes when payments to the entity are deducted by the payer but not included in income because the establishment jurisdiction sees the income as belonging to non-resident owners, while the owner jurisdiction sees the income as belonging to the entity.

The 2015 recommendations initially addressed reverse hybrids through the standard linking rules, but the Inclusive Framework subsequently developed additional recommendations treating reverse hybrids as residents of the establishment jurisdiction where certain conditions are met. This requires the establishment jurisdiction to tax income that would otherwise escape taxation due to the mismatch.

The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) implemented specific reverse hybrid rules effective from January 2022, requiring Member States to treat reverse hybrid entities as resident for tax purposes where the mismatch would otherwise result in double non-taxation.

#### 4.4. Branch Mismatch Arrangements

Branch mismatches arise from differences in how jurisdictions allocate income and expenses between a branch and its head office, or from differences in recognising the existence of a branch altogether. Unlike hybrid entity or instrument mismatches, branch mismatches do not result from different legal characterisations but from different approaches to attributing income within a single legal entity.

The OECD released additional recommendations on branch mismatches in 2017, extending the Action 2 framework to address these arrangements. Five categories of branch mismatch were identified: deemed branch payments, disregarded branch structures, diverted branch payments, double deduction branch structures, and deemed branch payments from transparent entities.

The branch mismatch recommendations follow the same linking rule approach, denying deductions or requiring income inclusions to neutralise the tax effect of the mismatch. However, the technical complexity of identifying branch mismatches can be greater because they often involve implicit allocations under domestic law rather than explicit payments.

#### 4.5. Imported Mismatch Arrangements

Imported mismatches represent the most complex category, arising when a hybrid mismatch benefit is shifted to a third jurisdiction through non-hybrid arrangements. A payment between two jurisdictions that does not itself create a mismatch may nevertheless be connected to a hybrid arrangement elsewhere in the structure that generates the ultimate tax benefit.

Without rules addressing imported mismatches, taxpayers could preserve hybrid mismatch benefits by inserting additional entities into structures, ensuring that the hybrid arrangement occurs between jurisdictions that have not implemented linking rules while the deductible payments flow from jurisdictions that have. The imported mismatch rules trace the connection between an otherwise ordinary payment and the underlying hybrid arrangement, denying deductions where the payment can be linked to untaxed income resulting from a hybrid mismatch.

The scope of imported mismatch rules varies in implementation. Some jurisdictions apply broad tracing rules that can catch arrangements several steps removed from the hybrid element, while others limit the rules to more direct arrangements. This variation can create planning opportunities where structures are designed to fall outside the particular imported mismatch rules of relevant jurisdictions.

### 5. Structured Arrangements

The hybrid mismatch recommendations apply automatically to arrangements between related parties, recognising that connected taxpayers are likely to structure transactions to exploit mismatches deliberately. For arrangements between unrelated parties, the rules apply only to structured arrangements where the mismatch was priced into the terms of the arrangement or where the arrangement was designed to produce a mismatch outcome.

This limitation reflects the concern that applying linking rules to all transactions could create excessive compliance burdens where parties have no knowledge of how counterparties are taxed. Independent parties dealing at arm's length typically would not share information about their tax positions, and applying linking rules to such transactions could create significant uncertainty.

The definition of structured arrangements focuses on objective indicators that the parties have taken the hybrid element into account. These include pricing that reflects the tax benefit of the mismatch, documentation that contemplates mismatch outcomes, or arrangement features that would only make commercial sense if a mismatch benefit were obtained.

### 6. Domestic Implementation

#### 6.1. The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive

The European Union addressed hybrid mismatches through two directives: ATAD I adopted in July 2016 and ATAD II adopted in May 2017. ATAD II extended the hybrid mismatch provisions to cover arrangements involving third countries and added rules on reverse hybrids, branch mismatches, and imported mismatches.

EU Member States were required to implement the main hybrid mismatch rules by January 2020, with reverse hybrid rules effective from January 2022. The directives set minimum standards, permitting Member States to adopt stricter rules if they choose. This flexibility has led to some variation in implementation across Member States, creating complexity for taxpayers operating across the European Union.

The ATAD framework generally follows the BEPS Action 2 recommendations but includes modifications reflecting EU policy priorities. The rules apply to corporate taxpayers within the scope of the directive, with specific provisions addressing payments to associated enterprises, permanent establishment mismatches, and tax residency mismatches.

#### 6.2. Implementation Beyond the EU

Major economies outside the European Union have also implemented hybrid mismatch rules following the BEPS recommendations. The United Kingdom introduced comprehensive rules in Finance Act 2016, effective from January 2017, becoming one of the first jurisdictions to implement the recommendations. Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Canada have subsequently enacted their own versions of hybrid mismatch legislation.

The United States adopted rules addressing certain hybrid arrangements through regulations under Internal Revenue Code provisions, though the approach differs in some respects from the OECD recommendations. US rules focus particularly on payments between related parties and apply specific mechanical tests rather than the more flexible mismatch identification approach of other jurisdictions.

Variations in implementation create planning opportunities and compliance challenges. Taxpayers operating across multiple jurisdictions must understand the specific scope and mechanics of each jurisdiction's rules, which may produce different outcomes for the same arrangement depending on which jurisdiction's perspective is applied.

### 7. Treaty-Related Provisions

#### 7.1. Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention

BEPS Action 2 includes recommendations for changes to tax treaties to support the domestic linking rules and address mismatches that arise from treaty provisions themselves. The Multilateral Instrument incorporates provisions addressing hybrid entity mismatches through amendments to treaty residence and benefit articles.

Article 3 of the MLI addresses transparent entities, providing that income derived through such entities shall be treated as income of a resident of a contracting state only to the extent that the income is treated as the income of a resident for tax purposes. This prevents treaty benefits being claimed for income that neither contracting state treats as belonging to a resident taxpayer.

Article 4 addresses dual resident entities, replacing the traditional tie-breaker rules with a requirement that competent authorities determine residence through mutual agreement. This prevents dual resident entities from accessing treaty benefits in ways that create mismatch opportunities.

#### 7.2. Interaction with Domestic Rules

The relationship between domestic hybrid mismatch rules and treaty provisions raises complex questions about which rules take priority. Treaties generally override domestic law under the principle of pacta sunt servanda, but many jurisdictions have enacted their hybrid mismatch rules as overriding provisions that apply notwithstanding treaty limitations.

The BEPS recommendations anticipate this interaction by noting that the domestic linking rules are designed to prevent double non-taxation, which is itself contrary to the object and purpose of tax treaties. This framing supports the view that applying linking rules does not violate treaty obligations because treaties were never intended to protect arrangements achieving double non-taxation.

### 8. Effectiveness and Challenges

#### 8.1. Complexity and Compliance Burden

The hybrid mismatch rules are among the most technically complex provisions in modern tax law. Determining whether a mismatch exists requires knowledge of how counterparty jurisdictions treat payments, entities, and instruments, information that taxpayers may not readily possess. The rules create significant compliance burdens, particularly for multinational enterprises with complex financing arrangements.

The period-by-period analysis required by some linking rules adds further complexity. A payment that does not create a mismatch in one period may create a mismatch in another if circumstances change in the counterparty jurisdiction. This requires ongoing monitoring of the tax treatment of arrangements rather than one-time analysis at inception.

#### 8.2. Potential for Unintended Consequences

Critics have noted that linking rules can produce arbitrary outcomes that do not align with traditional tax principles. The rules focus on whether income is taxed somewhere rather than whether it is taxed appropriately according to the principles of either jurisdiction. This can result in taxation disconnected from the jurisdiction's normal policy framework.

The potential for overlap with other anti-avoidance measures creates risks of multiple adjustments affecting the same arrangement. Interest limitation rules under BEPS Action 4, controlled foreign company rules, and transfer pricing adjustments may all apply to arrangements that also involve hybrid elements. Coordination between these different provisions is not always clear, potentially resulting in taxation exceeding what either jurisdiction would normally impose.

#### 8.3. Comparison with Alternative Approaches

The linking rules approach adopted by BEPS Action 2 represents a choice to work within existing domestic law frameworks rather than seeking harmonisation of underlying rules. Tax harmonisation would eliminate mismatches at source by ensuring jurisdictions characterise entities and instruments consistently, removing the gaps that hybrid arrangements exploit.

However, harmonisation faces fundamental obstacles. National sovereignty over tax policy represents a core principle that countries are reluctant to abandon. Different economic structures, policy priorities, and legal traditions make agreement on harmonised rules difficult to achieve. The European Union's experience with proposals such as the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base demonstrates the practical and political challenges of harmonisation even among closely integrated economies.

Linking rules offer a more feasible alternative by preserving national discretion over underlying rules while coordinating outcomes when those rules interact to produce mismatches. This approach respects sovereignty but creates complexity and may produce outcomes that lack coherence when viewed from any single jurisdiction's policy perspective.

### 9. Practical Application

When analysing hybrid mismatch arrangements, practitioners must first identify whether a mismatch exists by comparing the tax treatment in relevant jurisdictions. This requires understanding how each jurisdiction characterises the entities, instruments, and payments involved, and whether those characterisations differ in ways that produce deduction/no inclusion or double deduction outcomes.

Having identified a mismatch, the next step is determining which jurisdiction's rules apply and what adjustment is required. The primary rule jurisdiction has first responsibility, with the defensive rule applying only if the primary rule is not applied. Taxpayers cannot choose which jurisdiction's rules to apply; the hierarchy established in the recommendations determines the outcome.

Documentation requirements for hybrid mismatch compliance are substantial. Taxpayers must be able to demonstrate the tax treatment of arrangements in counterparty jurisdictions and show that appropriate adjustments have been made. This may require obtaining representations from counterparties or conducting independent analysis of foreign tax law.

### 10. Future Developments

The hybrid mismatch framework continues to evolve as jurisdictions gain experience with implementation and new structures emerge. The Inclusive Framework monitors implementation and may develop additional guidance where practical difficulties arise or where gaps in coverage become apparent.

The interaction between hybrid mismatch rules and the Pillar Two global minimum tax raises questions about how these regimes will operate together. Pillar Two's top-up tax mechanism addresses low-taxed income generally, which may reduce the incentive to implement hybrid arrangements designed to achieve double non-taxation. However, the regimes have different scopes and mechanics, and their interaction requires careful analysis.

Ongoing work on transfer pricing and the digital economy may also affect hybrid mismatch analysis. As international tax rules evolve to address new business models and value creation concepts, the characterisation issues underlying hybrid mismatches may shift, requiring adaptation of the linking rules framework to address emerging challenges.
