## Chapter 4.2: Tax Information Exchange Agreements

Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) represent a specialized instrument in the international tax cooperation framework, designed specifically to facilitate the exchange of tax-relevant information between jurisdictions. Unlike comprehensive double taxation agreements, TIEAs focus exclusively on information exchange without addressing the allocation of taxing rights, making them particularly useful for establishing cooperation with jurisdictions where a full tax treaty may not be feasible or desirable.

### 1. Introduction to TIEAs

#### 1.1. Definition and Purpose

A Tax Information Exchange Agreement is a formal bilateral or multilateral agreement between jurisdictions that establishes a legal framework for the exchange of information pertinent to the administration and enforcement of domestic tax laws. TIEAs serve several fundamental purposes in the international tax system.

The primary objective is combating tax evasion. By enabling access to information held in other jurisdictions, TIEAs help tax authorities detect and prevent tax evasion schemes that exploit cross-border complexities. Taxpayers who attempt to conceal income or assets in foreign jurisdictions can no longer rely on information barriers to shield their non-compliance from detection.

TIEAs also ensure compliance by assisting tax authorities in verifying the accuracy of taxpayers' declarations. When domestic authorities can obtain information about their residents' foreign activities, they can more effectively ensure that individuals and corporations pay the correct amount of tax on their worldwide income.

Furthermore, TIEAs promote transparency by fostering an environment of openness and cooperation between jurisdictions. This enhanced transparency contributes to the integrity of the global tax system and helps level the playing field between taxpayers who comply with their obligations and those who seek to evade them.

#### 1.2. Historical Context and Development

The development of TIEAs is closely linked to the OECD's efforts to combat harmful tax practices. In 1998, the OECD published its landmark report on harmful tax competition, identifying the lack of effective exchange of information as one of the key criteria for determining harmful tax practices. Jurisdictions that refused to share tax information with their treaty partners were effectively facilitating tax evasion by their partners' residents.

In response to this concern, the OECD established the Global Forum on Taxation in 2000, which was later restructured as the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes in 2009. A key output of this initiative was the development of a model agreement that could serve as the template for bilateral TIEAs between jurisdictions.

The impetus for TIEAs accelerated following the 2008 financial crisis, when governments worldwide sought to combat offshore tax evasion more aggressively. The G20 endorsed the international standard for exchange of information, and jurisdictions faced increased pressure to enter into TIEAs or risk being identified as non-cooperative.

### 2. The OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of Information

#### 2.1. Development and Release

In April 2002, the OECD released the Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters, developed by the Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information. This model agreement was designed to set a global standard for TIEAs and provide a template that jurisdictions could use when negotiating bilateral agreements.

The model agreement is not itself a binding instrument but rather a template containing two versions: a multilateral version and a bilateral version. Both versions share substantially the same text, differing primarily in their procedural provisions. The bilateral version has been the more commonly used template, forming the basis for hundreds of TIEAs negotiated since 2002.

Many jurisdictions have adopted the OECD Model Agreement as their standard template for TIEA negotiations. This widespread adoption promotes consistency across agreements and simplifies the negotiation process, as parties can rely on an internationally recognized and well-understood standard.

#### 2.2. Structure and Key Provisions

The OECD Model TIEA is organized into a series of articles addressing the essential elements of information exchange. Article 1 establishes the object and scope of the agreement, committing the contracting parties to provide assistance through exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of their domestic laws concerning taxes.

Article 2 defines the jurisdiction and scope, clarifying that a party is not obligated to provide information that is neither held by its authorities nor in the possession of persons within its territorial jurisdiction. Article 3 addresses the taxes covered by the agreement, which typically extends to all taxes imposed by the contracting parties rather than being limited to income taxes as in most DTAs.

Article 4 sets out the definitions used in the agreement, including key terms such as "competent authority," "person," and "information." Article 5, which is central to the operation of TIEAs, establishes the detailed requirements for exchange of information upon request.

Articles 6 through 8 address tax examinations abroad, the possibility of declining requests, and confidentiality requirements respectively. The remaining articles cover costs, implementing legislation, language requirements, and the procedures for entry into force and termination.

#### 2.3. Scope of Information Exchange

The scope of information exchange under a TIEA is notably broad. Unlike Article 26 of DTAs, which may be limited by the treaty's personal and material scope, TIEAs are designed to cover all taxes administered by the contracting parties. This includes not only income and capital taxes but also value-added tax, goods and services tax, and other indirect taxes.

The "foreseeably relevant" standard applies to TIEAs just as it does to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Information must have a reasonable possibility of being relevant to the tax affairs under investigation at the time of the request. The requesting party cannot engage in fishing expeditions or make speculative requests without a genuine investigative basis.

Importantly, TIEAs typically provide that information may be requested regardless of whether the conduct under investigation would constitute a crime under the laws of the requested party. This ensures that differences in how jurisdictions criminalize tax offenses do not impede effective cooperation.

### 3. Operation of TIEAs

#### 3.1. Exchange Mechanisms

The primary mechanism contemplated by the original OECD Model TIEA was exchange of information upon request. Under this mechanism, the competent authority of one contracting party submits a formal request to the competent authority of the other party seeking specific information relevant to a tax investigation or administration.

The requesting party must generally have exhausted all reasonable domestic sources of information before making a request under a TIEA. This requirement ensures that TIEAs are used as a supplement to domestic information-gathering powers rather than as a first resort.

While the original model focused on exchange on request, many jurisdictions have subsequently agreed to extend their TIEAs to cover automatic and spontaneous exchange as well. The 2015 Model Protocol, discussed below, provides a standardized mechanism for such extensions.

#### 3.2. Request Requirements

Article 5 of the OECD Model TIEA sets out detailed requirements that a request must satisfy. A proper request must identify the person under examination or investigation, specify the period for which information is sought, describe the nature of the information requested and the form in which the requesting party would prefer to receive it, and explain the tax purpose for which the information is sought.

Additionally, the request must include grounds for believing that the information is held by the requested party or is in the possession of a person within its jurisdiction, the name and address (if known) of any person believed to be in possession of the requested information, a statement that the request conforms with the laws and administrative practices of the requesting party, and a statement that the requesting party has pursued all reasonable means available in its own territory to obtain the information.

These detailed requirements serve multiple purposes. They ensure that requests are specific and targeted rather than speculative, they demonstrate that the requesting party has a genuine investigative basis for seeking the information, and they enable the requested party to locate and provide the relevant information efficiently.

#### 3.3. Confidentiality and Data Protection

Confidentiality is a cornerstone of the TIEA framework. Article 8 of the OECD Model requires that any information received by a contracting party shall be treated as confidential and may only be disclosed to persons or authorities concerned with the assessment, collection, or administration of taxes, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of tax matters, or the determination of appeals relating to taxes.

The information may be disclosed in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions, but otherwise must be kept strictly confidential. The requested party may require that specific conditions of confidentiality be applied by the requesting party, and may decline to provide information if it is not satisfied that adequate confidentiality protections will be maintained.

Jurisdictions must ensure that their domestic data protection laws do not impede effective information exchange. At the same time, they must implement appropriate safeguards to protect the personal data of taxpayers whose information is exchanged under TIEAs.

### 4. Limitations and Safeguards

#### 4.1. Grounds for Declining Requests

Article 7 of the OECD Model TIEA sets out the circumstances in which a requested party may decline to provide information. The requested party is not required to obtain or provide information that the requesting party would not be able to obtain under its own laws for purposes of the administration or enforcement of its own tax laws.

The requested party may also decline where the request would require it to carry out measures at variance with its own laws and administrative practices, or to supply information that is not obtainable under its laws or in the normal course of its administration.

Information that would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secret or trade process may be withheld, as may information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). Information subject to attorney-client privilege or legal professional privilege is also protected from compulsory disclosure.

#### 4.2. Protection of Sensitive Information

The protection of sensitive information reflects the balance that TIEAs must strike between effective cooperation and respect for legitimate confidentiality interests. Trade secrets and similar protections safeguard genuinely confidential commercial information that could cause competitive harm if disclosed.

The public policy exception is interpreted narrowly and is reserved for cases where disclosure would conflict with fundamental values of the requested state. It is not intended to provide a broad exception that could frustrate the purposes of the agreement.

Notably, TIEAs do not permit a requested party to decline a request solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee, or agent, or because the information relates to ownership interests in a person. This provision, which mirrors Article 26(5) of the OECD Model Tax Convention, ensures that traditional banking secrecy cannot be invoked to refuse cooperation.

### 5. Relationship with Double Taxation Agreements

#### 5.1. Comparative Analysis

TIEAs differ from double taxation agreements in several significant respects. DTAs are comprehensive treaties that address the allocation of taxing rights between contracting states, providing relief from double taxation and establishing rules for the taxation of various categories of income. Article 26 of DTAs addresses exchange of information as one component of a broader treaty framework.

TIEAs, by contrast, focus exclusively on information exchange. They do not contain provisions allocating taxing rights or providing relief from double taxation. This narrower focus makes TIEAs appropriate for relationships where a comprehensive tax treaty is not warranted or desired.

TIEAs typically cover a broader range of taxes than DTAs. While most DTAs are limited to taxes on income and capital, TIEAs commonly extend to all taxes administered by the contracting parties, including indirect taxes. TIEAs may also cover both criminal and civil tax matters, whereas DTA exchange provisions may be more limited in scope.

#### 5.2. Complementary Instruments

TIEAs and DTAs serve complementary functions in the international tax framework. Jurisdictions may negotiate TIEAs with partners where a DTA does not exist or is not feasible, ensuring that information exchange is available even in the absence of a comprehensive treaty relationship.

In some cases, jurisdictions may have both a DTA and a TIEA with the same partner, with the TIEA providing broader exchange capabilities than the DTA's Article 26 provision. The relationship between overlapping instruments is typically addressed through provisions specifying which agreement takes precedence or how they operate in conjunction.

The proliferation of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters has reduced the need for bilateral TIEAs in many cases, as the Convention provides a comprehensive multilateral framework for exchange of information. However, TIEAs remain important for relationships with jurisdictions that are not parties to the Convention (covered in December 2023).

### 6. Implementation and Compliance

#### 6.1. Domestic Legislative Requirements

For a TIEA to function effectively, each contracting party must have domestic laws that authorize and enable information exchange. This includes legislation that empowers tax authorities to collect information from financial institutions, individuals, and entities, and to share that information with foreign counterparts.

Jurisdictions must also ensure that their domestic laws permit the gathering of information even when the jurisdiction has no domestic tax interest in the matter. This addresses the historical barrier where some jurisdictions would only gather information if they needed it for their own tax purposes.

The implementation of TIEAs may require amendments to domestic laws addressing bank secrecy, data protection, and the powers of tax authorities. Jurisdictions that have traditionally maintained strict financial secrecy have had to reform their laws to comply with international exchange standards.

#### 6.2. Entry into Force

Article 10 of the OECD Model TIEA addresses entry into force. Both contracting parties must complete their internal procedures necessary to bring the agreement into force, which may include parliamentary ratification or executive approval depending on the jurisdiction's constitutional requirements.

Each party typically notifies the other when its internal procedures have been completed, and the agreement enters into force on a date specified in the agreement, often the date of the later notification or a specified period thereafter. The agreement will specify the date from which its provisions take effect, which may differ for different categories of taxes or types of exchange.

### 7. The 2015 Model Protocol

#### 7.1. Extension to Automatic and Spontaneous Exchange

In June 2015, the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs approved a Model Protocol that jurisdictions can use to extend the scope of their existing TIEAs to cover automatic and spontaneous exchange of information. This development reflected the growing importance of automatic exchange, particularly following the adoption of the Common Reporting Standard.

The Model Protocol provides standardized language that can be added to existing TIEAs through a supplementary agreement. It enables jurisdictions to build on their existing bilateral relationships rather than negotiating entirely new instruments to accommodate automatic exchange.

#### 7.2. Practical Implications

The extension of TIEAs to automatic exchange has significant practical implications. Financial institutions in jurisdictions with extended TIEAs must implement the due diligence and reporting procedures required for automatic exchange, identifying non-resident account holders and reporting their financial account information to tax authorities.

Tax authorities must establish the technical infrastructure necessary to receive, process, and transmit large volumes of financial account information automatically. This represents a substantial administrative undertaking that goes well beyond the case-by-case approach of exchange on request.

### 8. International Framework and Peer Review

#### 8.1. Role of the Global Forum

The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes plays a central role in monitoring and promoting compliance with international exchange of information standards. With over 160 member jurisdictions, the Global Forum is the principal international body responsible for ensuring that TIEAs and other exchange mechanisms operate effectively.

The Global Forum develops and maintains the international standards for exchange of information, including the EOIR standard that underpins TIEAs. It provides guidance on the interpretation and application of these standards and assists jurisdictions in implementing effective exchange frameworks.

#### 8.2. Compliance Assessment

The Global Forum conducts peer reviews to assess jurisdictions' compliance with international exchange of information standards. The peer review process evaluates both the legal framework for exchange and its practical implementation.

Reviews assess whether jurisdictions have the necessary legal authority to obtain and exchange information, whether ownership and accounting information is available, and whether exchange mechanisms operate effectively in practice. Jurisdictions are rated as Compliant, Largely Compliant, Partially Compliant, or Non-Compliant based on their performance.

The first round of peer reviews took place from 2010 to 2016, covering 125 jurisdictions. A second round commenced in 2016, incorporating a strengthened standard that includes requirements for the availability of beneficial ownership information. Jurisdictions that receive unfavorable ratings face reputational consequences and may be subject to defensive measures by other jurisdictions.
