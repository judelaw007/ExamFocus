## Chapter 1.1: Work of the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices

### 1. Origins and Establishment of the FHTP

#### 1.1. The 1998 OECD Report

The Forum on Harmful Tax Practices (FHTP) traces its origins to the OECD's 1998 report "Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue." This foundational document emerged from growing concerns about the effects of increased capital mobility in the 1990s, the proliferation of offshore financial centres, and recognition that unilateral measures by individual countries could not effectively address cross-border tax avoidance. The report represented the first comprehensive international effort to distinguish between legitimate tax competition and harmful tax practices.

The 1998 report established that tax competition itself is not inherently harmful. States retain sovereign authority to set their general tax rates at whatever level they choose, and competition can promote efficiency and discipline government spending. What becomes potentially harmful is the combination of low or preferential rates with other features that facilitate base erosion and profit shifting, particularly the absence of substantial economic activity and the lack of transparency.

The report distinguished between two categories of harmful practices. Tax havens were defined as jurisdictions with no or nominal taxes that offer themselves as places to escape tax otherwise due in other jurisdictions, without requiring genuine economic activity. Preferential tax regimes were defined as special arrangements within otherwise normal tax systems that provide preferential treatment to certain activities or income types, typically mobile financial or intangible income.

The report established four key criteria for identifying tax havens: no or only nominal taxation, which was the starting point but not harmful in itself; lack of effective exchange of information with other tax authorities; lack of transparency in legislative, legal, or administrative provisions; and the absence of substantial activity requirements. For preferential regimes, additional indicators included ring-fencing from the domestic economy, where benefits were available only to non-residents or for foreign income while excluding domestic taxpayers.

#### 1.2. Establishment and Early Development of the Forum

Following publication of the 1998 report, the OECD established the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices to oversee implementation of its nineteen recommendations. The FHTP was tasked with reviewing preferential regimes in OECD member countries and engaging with non-member jurisdictions identified as tax havens.

The early years proved challenging. The initiative faced significant resistance from jurisdictions that challenged the legitimacy of OECD standards, arguing they had no voice in developing rules that would affect their economies. Small states contended they were being discriminated against by larger countries that maintained their own preferential regimes. Most significantly, the US administration in 2001 withdrew support for the substance criterion, arguing it inappropriately constrained legitimate tax competition.

In response to these challenges, the FHTP effectively shifted focus from substance to transparency during the 2000s. The framework became primarily about ensuring jurisdictions would share information with other tax authorities rather than requiring genuine economic activity. The OECD developed the model Tax Information Exchange Agreement as a template for bilateral agreements, and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes was established to monitor compliance through peer review. By 2009, under G20 pressure following the global financial crisis, virtually all significant financial centres had committed to implementing the internationally agreed standard for information exchange on request.

### 2. BEPS Reinvigoration and the Inclusive Framework

#### 2.1. The BEPS Project and Action 5

The G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, launched in 2013 and completed in 2015, reinvigorated the harmful tax practices agenda with renewed emphasis on substance. BEPS Action 5 on countering harmful tax practices more effectively became one of the four BEPS minimum standards that all participating jurisdictions committed to implement and that would be subject to peer review.

Critically, Action 5 restored the substance requirement that had been abandoned in the early 2000s. The international community recognised that transparency alone was insufficient to address profit shifting to jurisdictions without genuine economic activity. The Action 5 Final Report reiterated the underlying concerns of the 1998 report while defining two priorities: further effort on transparency through compulsory spontaneous exchange of information on rulings related to preferential regimes, and requiring substantial activities for all preferential tax regimes to reduce incentives for investment without economic substance (covered in December 2023).

The continued importance of work on harmful tax practices was highlighted by its inclusion in the 2013 BEPS Action Plan as a Minimum Standard. This elevated the FHTP's work from a voluntary framework to a commitment backed by peer review and the reputational consequences of non-compliance.

#### 2.2. The Inclusive Framework Era

The establishment of the Inclusive Framework on BEPS in 2016 dramatically expanded the FHTP's reach. Over 145 jurisdictions now participate in the Inclusive Framework, committing to implement the BEPS minimum standards including Action 5. This transformation changed the FHTP from an OECD member country initiative to a truly global framework with peer review mechanisms covering developed and developing countries alike.

The expansion brought both opportunities and challenges. The broader participation increased the legitimacy and reach of FHTP standards, but also required accommodating diverse economic circumstances and development priorities. Developing countries often lack the administrative capacity to implement sophisticated substance requirements or participate effectively in information exchange. The FHTP now includes capacity building activities to help developing economies implement changes effectively.

### 3. Current FHTP Workstreams

The current work of the FHTP comprises three key areas that together form a comprehensive approach to countering harmful tax practices.

#### 3.1. Assessment of Preferential Tax Regimes

The first workstream involves identifying features of preferential regimes that can facilitate base erosion and profit shifting, potentially impacting the tax base of other jurisdictions unfairly. The FHTP utilises specific criteria to evaluate preferential regimes, examining factors such as ring-fencing of specific types of income or activities for preferential tax treatment, and the presence or absence of substantial activities required to receive tax benefits.

Since the start of the BEPS Project, the FHTP has reviewed 332 preferential regimes across all Inclusive Framework jurisdictions. Over forty percent of these regimes have been abolished or are in the process of being abolished. The remaining regimes have either been assessed as not harmful, having met the nexus approach and substance requirements, or are being amended to comply with the international standard (covered in June 2023).

The peer review process classifies regimes into three categories: harmful, where the regime does not meet substance requirements; not harmful, where the regime meets the nexus approach and other factors; and potentially harmful, where assessment of economic effects has not yet been completed.

Harmful tax competition through preferential regimes can occur when jurisdictions adopt such arrangements to attract mobile activities, creating what has been described as a "race to the bottom" where countries spiral down to low corporate tax rates to outdo each other. The FHTP's assessments help distinguish between legitimate tax competition, which can drive economic growth, and harmful practices that enable one jurisdiction to poach another's tax base without genuine economic activity occurring.

#### 3.2. Transparency Framework on Tax Rulings

The second workstream involves the compulsory spontaneous exchange of relevant information on taxpayer-specific rulings which, in the absence of such exchange, could give rise to BEPS concerns. This transparency framework addresses the risk that secret or opaque rulings could facilitate harmful tax practices.

The framework covers six categories of rulings: rulings relating to preferential regimes; unilateral advance pricing agreements or other cross-border unilateral rulings on transfer pricing; cross-border rulings providing for downward adjustment of taxable profits; permanent establishment rulings; related party conduit rulings; and any other type of ruling the FHTP deems relevant.

As at December 2024, over 28,500 tax rulings in scope of the transparency framework had been issued by reviewed jurisdictions cumulatively since 2010. Over 2,300 new rulings were issued in 2024 alone. More than 64,000 exchanges of information have taken place under the framework, with approximately 5,500 exchanges in 2024. This substantial volume of exchanges provides tax administrations with timely information about rulings that could affect their own tax bases.

The FHTP is also responsible for developing the Exchange on Tax Rulings XML Schema and User Guide, providing a standardised electronic format for exchanges between jurisdictions. In September 2025, the OECD released a revised framework and schema to enhance effectiveness based on experience since implementation.

#### 3.3. Substantial Activities in No or Nominal Tax Jurisdictions

The third workstream involves reviewing substantial activities requirements in jurisdictions with no or only nominal taxation. This global standard ensures that mobile business income cannot be parked in zero-tax jurisdictions without core business functions being undertaken by the entity in that location.

The FHTP has identified twelve jurisdictions as no or only nominal tax jurisdictions with the necessary domestic legal framework to meet the substance standard: Anguilla, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United Arab Emirates. The UAE was included until its introduction of a nine percent corporate income tax in June 2023, after which it was removed from this category.

These jurisdictions have enacted economic substance legislation requiring entities to demonstrate substantial activities appropriate to their operations. For headquarters functions, entities must take strategic decisions in the jurisdiction. For holding companies, investment decisions must be made locally. For financing activities, entities must manage risks and maintain capital in the jurisdiction.

The FHTP conducts annual monitoring of compliance with substance requirements in these jurisdictions. The fourth annual review, completed in December 2024, found all jurisdictions met the standard, though some issues were noted regarding monitoring and information exchange in certain jurisdictions.

### 4. The Modified Nexus Approach for IP Regimes

#### 4.1. Intellectual Property Regimes and Substance

Intellectual property regimes, including patent boxes and innovation boxes, allow income from the exploitation of IP to be taxed at lower rates than standard statutory rates. These regimes were particularly controversial because they could attract mobile IP income without requiring the underlying research and development activities that created the intellectual property.

BEPS Action 5 introduced the modified nexus approach as the substantial activity requirement for IP regimes. The core principle is that tax benefits from IP income must be linked to the research and development expenditure incurred by the taxpayer that generated the IP asset. This uses expenditure as a proxy for substantial activity—if a taxpayer performed or funded the R&D activities creating the IP, benefits are available; if the taxpayer merely acquired the IP or had related parties perform the R&D, benefits are limited.

#### 4.2. The Nexus Ratio Formula

The nexus approach operates through a formula calculating qualifying income based on the ratio of qualifying expenditure to overall expenditure. Qualifying expenditure includes R&D costs incurred directly by the taxpayer or outsourced to unrelated parties at arm's length. Overall expenditure includes all costs to develop the IP, including acquisition costs and related-party R&D costs.

A thirty percent uplift allows some credit for related-party or acquisition costs, up to thirty percent of qualifying expenditure. This recognises that complete exclusion of such costs would be excessively restrictive while still ensuring the primary link between benefits and the taxpayer's own activities.

The practical effect is that an entity performing its own R&D or outsourcing to independent contractors receives the full benefit of an IP regime. An entity that merely acquires IP or has related parties perform R&D receives limited benefits proportionate to any direct expenditure incurred. By 2024, all IP regimes under review were either abolished or amended to comply with the nexus approach, with grandfathering of existing arrangements ending by June 2024 in most cases (covered in June 2023).

### 5. FHTP Peer Review Process

#### 5.1. Review Methodology

The FHTP's peer review process provides the enforcement mechanism for the Action 5 minimum standard. Reviews assess whether jurisdictions have implemented the required transparency framework and whether their preferential regimes meet substance requirements. Jurisdictions undergo regular reviews, with results published to create transparency and accountability.

The peer review process relies on information from reviewed jurisdictions, input from peers who received exchanges under the transparency framework, and assessment by FHTP delegates. Results are approved by the Inclusive Framework on BEPS before publication.

Recent developments include simplifications and improvements to the peer review process. A July 2025 report recognised progress made and sought to reduce burdens while maintaining effectiveness. The revised terms of reference applicable from 2025 and the updated assessment methodology for reviews starting in 2026 aim to streamline the process while continuing to ensure compliance.

#### 5.2. Outcomes and Compliance

The peer review process has driven substantial changes in tax policy globally. Jurisdictions have abolished harmful regimes, amended IP boxes to comply with the nexus approach, enacted economic substance legislation, and established systems for exchanging information on tax rulings.

The transparency framework peer reviews assess jurisdictions against three elements: the legal framework for identifying rulings, the processes for information gathering and exchange, and the actual exchanges undertaken. Jurisdictions receive ratings reflecting their compliance level, with recommendations where improvements are needed.

### 6. Challenges and Future Directions

#### 6.1. Ongoing Implementation Challenges

Despite significant progress, the FHTP faces continuing challenges. Ensuring consistent implementation across more than 140 Inclusive Framework jurisdictions requires significant monitoring resources. Tax planning practices continue to evolve in response to new rules, requiring the FHTP to adapt its framework to address emerging structures.

Political and economic interests among member countries can create difficulty in developing common standards. Jurisdictions that have historically benefited from preferential regimes may resist changes, while others argue that some tax competition remains inherently legitimate. Striking the balance between promoting healthy tax competition that fosters economic growth and preventing harmful practices that erode other jurisdictions' tax bases remains challenging.

Resource constraints affect implementation, particularly for developing economies that may lack the expertise or infrastructure to effectively implement FHTP recommendations. The FHTP's capacity building activities seek to address this challenge, but practical implementation issues persist. Opposition from stakeholders, including tax advisory firms and multinational enterprises that may resist reforms reducing their ability to minimise effective tax rates, can also influence jurisdictions and create obstacles to change.

As tax avoidance tactics evolve in response to new rules, the FHTP must continuously monitor and adapt workstreams to address emerging concerns. The FHTP monitors for new evasion techniques should they emerge, seeking to adapt and address challenges in close to real-time. This requires flexibility in the FHTP's workstreams while maintaining the core principles established since 1998 (covered in December 2023).

#### 6.2. Relationship with Pillar Two

The relationship between the FHTP framework and Pillar Two of the two-pillar solution raises important questions about future direction. Pillar Two's global minimum tax of fifteen percent directly addresses low-taxed income by allowing parent jurisdictions to impose top-up tax on subsidiaries taxed below the minimum rate.

This may reduce the importance of traditional FHTP work on preferential regimes, since enterprises within scope of Pillar Two will face at least fifteen percent tax regardless of where they book profits. However, the FHTP continues as a complementary framework. Substance requirements remain relevant even with a minimum tax—an entity with genuine R&D activity may deserve different treatment than a brass plate holding company, even if both face the same minimum effective rate.

#### 6.3. The Digital Economy and Continuing Evolution

The digitalisation of business activities presents ongoing challenges for the FHTP. Digital business models can generate substantial income without significant physical presence, creating difficulties in applying traditional substance requirements. The FHTP continues to explore how digital business models interact with preferential tax regimes.

The work of the FHTP has significantly evolved since its inception in 1998, largely in response to growing complexity in the area of harmful tax practices. From its broad initial mandate to develop measures countering the distorting effects of harmful tax competition, the work has expanded into specific, actionable workstreams: the programme for reviewing preferential regimes, the transparency framework for tax rulings, and substance requirements for no or nominal tax jurisdictions.

With the establishment of the Inclusive Framework in 2016 and commitment to implementing BEPS minimum standards, the FHTP's work now covers a global array of jurisdictions. The Forum has become more robust, adaptable, and responsive to emerging challenges, ensuring that principles of transparency, substance, and fairness remain at the forefront of global tax discussions. As the international tax landscape continues to evolve, the FHTP's work in eliminating harmful tax practices must similarly continue to adapt.
