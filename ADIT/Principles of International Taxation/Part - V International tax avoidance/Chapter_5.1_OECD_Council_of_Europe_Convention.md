## Chapter 5.1: The OECD/Council of Europe Convention

### 1. Introduction and Historical Development

The Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters represents the most comprehensive multilateral instrument for international cooperation in tax administration. Developed jointly by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Council of Europe, this Convention provides a unified legal framework enabling tax authorities worldwide to assist one another in combating tax evasion and ensuring proper tax enforcement across borders.

#### 1.1. Origins of the Convention

The original Convention was concluded in 1988 and entered into force in 1995. It was initially available only to member states of the OECD and the Council of Europe, reflecting its origins as a regional instrument for developed economies. The Convention addressed a fundamental challenge in international taxation: while taxpayers could easily move assets and income across borders, tax authorities remained constrained by national boundaries and lacked effective mechanisms for cross-border cooperation.

#### 1.2. The 2010 Protocol

A significant amending Protocol was adopted in 2010 and entered into force in June 2011. This Protocol transformed the Convention from a regional instrument into a truly global framework for administrative assistance. The key changes included opening the Convention to all countries worldwide, regardless of OECD or Council of Europe membership, and aligning its provisions with the contemporary international standard for exchange of information. The Protocol also removed certain restrictions that had limited the Convention's effectiveness, including requirements for dual criminality and domestic tax interest. *(covered in June 2025)*

### 2. Scope and Coverage

#### 2.1. Taxes Covered

The Convention applies to administrative assistance concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed by the parties. This comprehensive scope includes taxes on income, profits, and capital gains; taxes on property, estates, inheritances, and gifts; and taxes on goods and services. The breadth of coverage distinguishes the Convention from bilateral tax treaties, which typically cover only income and capital taxes.

#### 2.2. Participating Jurisdictions

As of 2025, over 150 jurisdictions participate in the Convention. This includes all G20 and OECD member countries, all major financial centres, and an increasing number of developing nations. The near-universal participation reflects the Convention's central role in the global architecture for tax transparency. Notably, the United States remains a party to the original 1988 Convention only, having not ratified the 2010 Protocol, though this does not prevent it from engaging in most forms of administrative assistance under the instrument.

### 3. Forms of Administrative Assistance

The Convention provides for six principal forms of administrative assistance, making it significantly more comprehensive than the exchange of information provisions found in bilateral tax treaties.

#### 3.1. Exchange of Information

The Convention establishes three mechanisms for information exchange. Exchange on request, governed by Article 5, enables a tax authority to request specific information about particular taxpayers or transactions from another jurisdiction. This mirrors the approach in Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and requires that information be "foreseeably relevant" to tax administration—a standard that permits broad cooperation while preventing speculative requests.

Automatic exchange, provided for in Article 6, involves the systematic transmission of predetermined categories of information without individual requests. This form of exchange requires the competent authorities to conclude specific agreements defining its scope and procedures. The Convention serves as the primary legal basis for the Common Reporting Standard, under which over 110 jurisdictions automatically exchange financial account information annually.

Spontaneous exchange under Article 7 occurs when a tax authority, in the course of its activities, obtains information that it considers would be of interest to another jurisdiction and transmits it without being asked. *(covered in June 2024)*

#### 3.2. Assistance in Collection

Articles 11 through 16 address assistance in the recovery of tax claims. Under these provisions, a requested state agrees to recover tax claims on behalf of an applicant state as if they were its own claims. This represents a significant departure from the traditional rule that states do not enforce foreign revenue laws. The assistance extends to measures of conservancy—protective measures to secure payment of tax claims before they become enforceable.

The Convention establishes important conditions and limitations. The tax claim must generally be enforceable in the applicant state and not subject to dispute. Time limits for recovery are governed by the laws of the applicant state, though the requested state is not obliged to take action beyond its own statutory limitations. These provisions complement Article 27 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which provides for similar assistance on a bilateral basis.

#### 3.3. Service of Documents

Article 17 enables tax authorities to request the service of documents, including those relating to judicial decisions, on persons located in another jurisdiction. This facilitates the effective notification of taxpayers concerning their tax obligations and ensures that enforcement proceedings can proceed with proper notice having been given.

### 4. Safeguards and Limitations

#### 4.1. Confidentiality Requirements

Article 22 imposes strict confidentiality obligations. Any information obtained under the Convention must be treated as secret and protected in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic law of the receiving state. Disclosure is permitted only to persons or authorities directly involved in tax assessment, collection, enforcement, prosecution, or appeals. Information may not be used for purposes other than those specified in the Convention without the supplying state's consent.

#### 4.2. Protection of Taxpayer Rights

The Convention recognises fundamental principles protecting taxpayer rights. States are not obliged to carry out measures contrary to their laws or administrative practices, nor to supply information that would disclose trade secrets or information contrary to public policy. These limitations ensure that administrative cooperation does not override legitimate protections established under domestic law.

### 5. Practical Operation

#### 5.1. Relationship with Bilateral Treaties

The Convention complements rather than replaces the network of over 3,500 bilateral tax treaties. Many bilateral treaties contain exchange of information provisions based on Article 26 of the OECD Model, and some include assistance in collection provisions based on Article 27. The Convention provides an additional legal basis for cooperation and often offers broader forms of assistance than bilateral agreements, particularly regarding automatic exchange and assistance in collection.

#### 5.2. Multilateral Competent Authority Agreements

A distinctive feature of the Convention's operation is the development of Multilateral Competent Authority Agreements concluded under its umbrella. Article 6 permits competent authorities to agree on the scope and procedures for automatic exchange. This mechanism has facilitated the rapid implementation of global standards for automatic exchange, including the Common Reporting Standard for financial account information and Country-by-Country Reporting under BEPS Action 13, without requiring renegotiation of thousands of bilateral treaties.
