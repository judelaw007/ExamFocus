## Chapter 2.2: Foreign Personal Holding Company Legislation – Examples from State Practice

### 1. Policy Rationale and Conceptual Framework

#### 1.1. The Accumulation Problem

Foreign personal holding company legislation addresses a specific dimension of international tax avoidance: the use of offshore entities to accumulate passive investment income beyond the reach of domestic taxation. Unlike controlled foreign company rules that focus broadly on controlled entities in low-tax jurisdictions, personal holding company regimes target structures where a small number of shareholders use corporate vehicles primarily to hold investments generating dividends, interest, rents, and royalties.

The policy concern centres on the transformation of what would otherwise be currently taxable investment income into deferred corporate profits. Without specific rules, shareholders could interpose a foreign holding company between themselves and their investment portfolio, allowing income to accumulate tax-free until eventual distribution—or potentially indefinitely through reinvestment and estate planning. Personal holding company legislation seeks to eliminate this deferral advantage by either imposing penalty taxes on undistributed income or requiring current inclusion by shareholders.

#### 1.2. Relationship with CFC Regimes

Personal holding company rules operate alongside, and often overlap with, controlled foreign company legislation. The key distinction lies in their respective targets: CFC rules typically apply where domestic residents control a foreign company regardless of income type, while personal holding company provisions focus specifically on the passive character of income accumulated in closely-held structures. In some jurisdictions, these regimes are integrated; in others, they represent separate legislative frameworks addressing related but distinct concerns.

### 2. United States – Foreign Personal Holding Company Income

#### 2.1. FPHCI Under Subpart F

The United States addresses foreign personal holding companies through the foreign personal holding company income (FPHCI) provisions within Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. Under IRC Section 954, FPHCI constitutes one category of foreign base company income that US shareholders of controlled foreign corporations must include in their current gross income regardless of actual distribution.

FPHCI encompasses the classic categories of passive investment income: dividends, interest, royalties, rents, and annuities. It also includes net gains from the sale or exchange of property that gives rise to such income, net gains from commodities and foreign currency transactions, income equivalent to interest, and income from notional principal contracts. The breadth of these categories reflects Congress's intent to capture the full range of investment returns that taxpayers might attempt to shelter through offshore structures.

#### 2.2. Exceptions and Modifications

The FPHCI rules incorporate several exceptions recognising legitimate business purposes for intercompany arrangements. The look-through exception under IRC 954(c)(6) excludes from FPHCI dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received from a related CFC to the extent attributable to non-Subpart F income of the paying CFC. This prevents cascading inclusions where one CFC receives passive-type payments from another CFC engaged in active business operations.

The same-country exception under IRC 954(c)(3) excludes dividend and interest income received from a related corporation organised in the same country as the CFC, provided the payor uses a substantial part of its assets in a trade or business in that country. This recognises that arrangements within a single jurisdiction often serve legitimate operational purposes rather than tax avoidance objectives. The high-tax exception may also apply where income is subject to an effective foreign tax rate exceeding ninety percent of the maximum US rate.

### 3. United States – Domestic Personal Holding Company Tax

#### 3.1. The PHC Penalty Tax

Distinct from the foreign rules, US domestic law imposes a separate penalty tax on personal holding companies (PHCs) through IRC Sections 541-547. This twenty percent tax applies to undistributed personal holding company income of corporations meeting both an ownership test and an income test. Unlike Subpart F, which attributes income to shareholders, the PHC tax imposes an additional corporate-level tax designed to force distribution of passive income.

A corporation meets the ownership test if five or fewer individuals own more than fifty percent of the stock value at any time during the last half of the tax year. The income test is satisfied when sixty percent or more of the corporation's adjusted ordinary gross income consists of personal holding company income—dividends, interest, royalties, rents (subject to adjustments), and certain personal service contract income.

#### 3.2. Automatic Application and Avoidance

The PHC tax applies automatically when both tests are met, without requiring the government to establish any intent element. This contrasts with the accumulated earnings tax, which requires proof that earnings were accumulated beyond reasonable business needs with the purpose of avoiding shareholder-level tax. The automatic nature of the PHC tax makes it particularly significant for closely-held corporations with substantial investment portfolios.

Corporations may avoid PHC tax by distributing sufficient dividends to reduce undistributed personal holding company income. The deficiency dividend procedure under IRC 547 permits retroactive elimination of PHC tax liability through post-determination distributions. Structural solutions include electing S corporation status, which eliminates the PHC tax entirely since S corporations pass income through to shareholders for current taxation.

### 4. United States – Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules

#### 4.1. PFIC Definition and Tests

The passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules, enacted in 1986, represent a separate anti-deferral regime targeting US shareholders of foreign corporations that accumulate passive income regardless of control. A foreign corporation qualifies as a PFIC if it meets either the income test (seventy-five percent or more of gross income is passive) or the asset test (fifty percent or more of assets produce or are held for the production of passive income).

Unlike CFC rules requiring more than fifty percent US ownership, the PFIC provisions apply regardless of ownership percentage. A US person holding a single share in a foreign mutual fund—itself holding a diversified portfolio of investments—may be subject to PFIC taxation. Common PFICs include foreign exchange-traded funds, foreign mutual funds, non-US unit trusts, and foreign entities with investment components.

#### 4.2. Punitive Taxation Mechanisms

The default PFIC taxation method—the excess distribution method—imposes deliberately punitive treatment to eliminate any advantage from offshore investing. When a US shareholder receives an excess distribution (exceeding 125 percent of the average of the three prior years) or sells PFIC shares, the gain is allocated ratably across all years of ownership. Each year's allocation is taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to that year, and an interest charge applies to the deferred tax.

Shareholders may mitigate this treatment through elections. The qualified electing fund (QEF) election requires annual inclusion of the shareholder's pro rata share of ordinary earnings and net capital gains, similar to partnership taxation, but requires the PFIC to provide annual information statements. The mark-to-market election requires annual recognition of unrealised gains and losses for publicly traded PFIC stock, converting the deferral advantage into current taxation at ordinary income rates.

### 5. United Kingdom – Offshore Fund Regime

#### 5.1. Historical Development

The United Kingdom introduced its offshore fund regime in 1984 to address the possibility of rolling up income in offshore funds with subsequent disposals being taxed only as capital gains rather than income. The original rules distinguished between "distributing funds" that distributed at least eighty-five percent of income and "non-distributing funds" that accumulated income within the fund structure.

The Finance Act 2009 substantially revised the regime, replacing the distributing/non-distributing distinction with the concept of "reporting funds" and "non-reporting funds." This change accommodated accumulation funds that do not distribute cash but nonetheless calculate and report income to investors for tax purposes.

#### 5.2. Current Reporting Fund Structure

Under the current rules, an offshore fund may apply for reporting fund status, which requires calculating income according to prescribed methods and reporting each investor's share of reportable income annually. Investors in reporting funds pay income tax on their share of reported income whether distributed or not, but gains on disposal are taxed as capital gains—currently at rates up to twenty-four percent for higher rate taxpayers.

Investors in non-reporting funds receive different treatment: they need not report undistributed income annually, but on disposal any gain is treated as an "offshore income gain" taxable at income tax rates reaching forty-five percent. This differential treatment creates a strong incentive for funds marketed to UK investors to obtain and maintain reporting status, ensuring investors receive the more favourable capital gains treatment on eventual disposal.

### 6. Germany – Investment Tax Act

#### 6.1. 2018 Reform Framework

Germany fundamentally reformed its investment fund taxation through the revised Investment Tax Act (Investmentsteuergesetz), effective from January 2018. The new system applies uniformly to both German and foreign investment funds, eliminating previous distinctions that created complexity and planning opportunities.

Under the reformed rules, investment funds are treated as taxable entities subject to corporation tax on their German-source income, including domestic dividends, domestic real estate income, and certain other domestic receipts. At the investor level, taxation applies to actual distributions, advance lump sums (Vorabpauschale) calculated using a statutory formula to prevent indefinite deferral, and gains on disposal. Partial exemptions apply depending on fund type—equity funds receive a thirty percent exemption, mixed funds fifteen percent, and real estate funds sixty percent for German properties.

#### 6.2. Exit Taxation Extension

The Annual Tax Act 2024 (Jahressteuergesetz 2024) extended German exit taxation to investment fund shares, effective from January 2025. Previously, exit taxation applied only to shareholdings in operating companies; the extension addresses concerns about investors relocating abroad to avoid taxation on accumulated gains in investment portfolios.

The new rules apply to individuals who have acquired investment shares with an acquisition cost of at least five hundred thousand euros, or who hold at least one percent of an investment fund's shares. On emigration from Germany or gratuitous transfers to non-residents, the unrealised appreciation is deemed realised and subject to tax at twenty-five percent. Deferral is available for up to seven years (twelve in certain cases) if the individual intends to return to Germany.

### 7. Australia – Foreign Investment Fund Rules

#### 7.1. Historical FIF Regime

Australia operated a foreign investment fund (FIF) regime from 1992 until its repeal effective from the 2010-11 income year. The FIF provisions applied to Australian residents with interests in foreign companies and trusts not controlled by Australians—filling the gap left by CFC rules that required Australian control.

The FIF regime used surrogate measures rather than actual income calculation, recognising that minority shareholders typically lack access to detailed financial information. Attribution was based on periodic movement in market value, application of a statutory interest rate, or accounting profit. The complexity and compliance burden of these rules ultimately led to their repeal.

#### 7.2. Current Treatment

Following repeal, income and gains from interests in foreign funds are generally subject to ordinary Australian tax rules. For most investments, this means taxation only on actual distributions and realised capital gains. The government estimated that repeal would reduce compliance costs by forty to eighty million dollars annually, reflecting the substantial burden the FIF rules had imposed.

The CFC rules continue to apply where Australians control the foreign entity, and specific provisions address foreign trusts with Australian connections. However, the deliberate policy choice to repeal the FIF regime reflects a judgment that the complexity costs outweighed the revenue protection benefits for investments below the control threshold.

### 8. Comparative Observations

The variety of approaches to foreign personal holding company legislation reflects different policy priorities and administrative capacities. The United States maintains the most comprehensive regime with three overlapping but distinct frameworks: FPHCI within Subpart F for controlled foreign corporations, the PHC penalty tax for domestic corporations, and PFIC rules for all foreign passive investment vehicles regardless of control.

The United Kingdom and Germany focus primarily on investment funds rather than broadly defined holding companies, with both jurisdictions emphasising reporting requirements as the mechanism for ensuring current taxation of accumulated income. Australia's repeal of its FIF regime represents a distinctive policy choice—accepting some revenue leakage in exchange for reduced compliance complexity.

Despite these variations, common themes emerge: the classification of passive versus active income, mechanisms for preventing indefinite deferral, and recognition through various exceptions that not all passive income accumulation represents abusive tax planning. The ongoing evolution of these regimes reflects the continuing tension between revenue protection objectives and the practical challenges of taxing income accumulated in foreign structures.
