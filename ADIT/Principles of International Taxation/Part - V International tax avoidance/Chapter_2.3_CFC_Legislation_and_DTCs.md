## Chapter 2.3: CFC and Equivalent Legislation and DTCs

### 1. The Fundamental Tension

#### 1.1. Competing Jurisdictional Claims

Controlled foreign company legislation creates a fundamental tension with double taxation conventions. CFC rules attribute income of a foreign subsidiary to domestic shareholders before actual distribution, effectively piercing the corporate veil for tax purposes. Double taxation conventions, by contrast, allocate taxing rights between contracting states based on the residence and source of income, treating parent and subsidiary as separate legal entities with distinct tax personalities.

This tension manifests most acutely when a residence state applies CFC rules to attribute income of a subsidiary resident in a treaty partner state. The subsidiary's profits have been allocated to its state of residence under the treaty's distributive rules, yet the parent's state now seeks to tax those same profits in the hands of the shareholder. Whether this constitutes an impermissible override of treaty obligations or a legitimate exercise of residence state taxing rights has generated substantial debate among courts, commentators, and tax authorities.

#### 1.2. The Policy Justification

The policy case for CFC compatibility with treaties rests on the anti-avoidance character of these rules. CFC legislation addresses situations where residents defer domestic taxation indefinitely by accumulating income in controlled foreign entities located in low-tax jurisdictions. Without the ability to apply such rules notwithstanding treaty limitations, residence states would be unable to protect their tax base against arrangements that exploit the separate legal personality of subsidiaries to achieve results unintended by either the domestic legislature or the treaty partners.

### 2. Treaty Compatibility: The Technical Debate

#### 2.1. The Article 7 Argument

The primary argument against CFC compatibility with tax treaties focuses on Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Article 7(1) provides that business profits of an enterprise of a contracting state shall be taxable only in that state, unless the enterprise carries on business through a permanent establishment in the other state. Critics argue that CFC rules violate this provision by subjecting the business profits of a foreign subsidiary—an enterprise of the other state—to taxation in the shareholder's residence state.

This argument extends to Article 10(5), which provides that a contracting state may not tax dividends paid by a company resident in the other state except in limited circumstances. Since CFC income is taxed regardless of actual dividend distribution, the argument posits that these rules effectively impose a tax on undeclared dividends in contravention of the treaty's dividend article.

#### 2.2. The OECD Commentary Position

The OECD Commentary adopts the contrary view that CFC rules are compatible with treaty obligations. According to the Commentary, CFC legislation constitutes internal rules that determine which facts give rise to a tax liability in the residence state. These rules do not tax the foreign subsidiary; rather, they tax the domestic shareholder on income attributed to that shareholder under domestic law. The taxpayer being taxed—the domestic shareholder—is not protected by Articles 7 or 10 because those provisions address the taxation of the foreign enterprise itself, not the residence state's taxation of its own residents.

Most OECD member states accept this interpretation, viewing CFC rules as compatible with their treaty obligations without requiring express treaty authorisation. The Commentary emphasises that states may adopt anti-avoidance measures to protect their tax base, provided appropriate relief from double taxation is made available (covered in June 2025).

### 3. The Saving Clause: Article 1(3)

#### 3.1. Introduction in the 2017 OECD Model

The 2017 revision of the OECD Model Tax Convention introduced Article 1(3), commonly known as the saving clause, which provides that a contracting state may tax its own residents as if the convention had not come into effect, except where specific provisions require otherwise. This addition formalised what had previously been an interpretation supported by the Commentary, making it explicitly binding as treaty text.

The saving clause confirms that residence states retain the right to apply their domestic tax rules—including CFC legislation, taxation of hybrid entities, and other anti-avoidance measures—to their own residents notwithstanding the treaty's distributive rules. By preserving this right at the treaty level, Article 1(3) addresses concerns that courts might interpret treaty provisions as limiting residence state taxing jurisdiction in ways unintended by the contracting parties.

#### 3.2. Scope and Excepted Provisions

The saving clause applies to residents as defined under Article 4, even where domestic law definitions differ. For dual residents where Article 4(3) applies, the clause operates only in relation to the state determined to be the state of residence for treaty purposes. Where competent authorities fail to reach agreement on dual residence, the person may lose treaty benefits entirely.

Certain provisions are expressly excepted from the saving clause to preserve their intended effect. Article 24 on non-discrimination is excepted because applying the saving clause would undermine the prohibition on nationality-based discrimination. Similarly, specific provisions in Articles relating to diplomatic privileges, student and trainee benefits, and pension provisions may be excepted where the contracting states determine that residence state taxation would defeat the provision's purpose.

#### 3.3. Consequences for Domestic Anti-Avoidance

The saving clause plays an important role in preserving residence state application of domestic anti-avoidance rules. CFC regimes, switch-over rules, and general anti-avoidance provisions may all benefit from the explicit confirmation that the residence state may tax its residents notwithstanding treaty allocations. This provides greater legal certainty than relying solely on Commentary interpretation, particularly in jurisdictions where courts have historically given treaties precedence over domestic law (covered in December 2023).

However, the saving clause does not remove the obligation to provide relief for double taxation where the residence state exercises its right to tax. Where both states assert taxing rights over the same income—albeit through different legal mechanisms—the residence state must generally provide credit or other relief for foreign taxes paid, ensuring that the saving clause does not result in juridical double taxation.

### 4. EU Constraints: Freedom of Establishment

#### 4.1. Cadbury Schweppes and Wholly Artificial Arrangements

Within the European Union, CFC rules face additional constraints arising from the freedom of establishment guaranteed by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The European Court of Justice addressed this issue in its landmark 2006 decision in Cadbury Schweppes, concerning the UK's CFC legislation as applied to subsidiaries established in Ireland.

The Court held that CFC rules restricting freedom of establishment can be justified only where they target wholly artificial arrangements that do not reflect economic reality. A subsidiary established in another member state with genuine economic activity cannot be subjected to CFC attribution merely because it benefits from a lower tax rate. The member state must establish that the arrangement involves no genuine economic substance and was created solely to avoid domestic taxation.

#### 4.2. Implications for EU Member States

The Cadbury Schweppes judgment significantly constrained the application of CFC rules within the EU. Member states reformed their legislation to incorporate substance tests distinguishing between genuine establishments and wholly artificial arrangements. The UK's current CFC regime under the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 reflects these constraints through its entity-level exemptions and gateway approach.

The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) of 2016 harmonised CFC rules across the EU while respecting the Cadbury Schweppes limitations. Article 7(2)(a) of ATAD provides an exemption where the controlled entity carries on substantive economic activity supported by staff, equipment, assets, and premises. This carve-out ensures that EU-compliant CFC rules do not apply where the establishment reflects genuine economic reality rather than an artificial profit-shifting arrangement.

### 5. Double Taxation Relief Mechanisms

#### 5.1. The Double Taxation Problem

CFC rules create a specific double taxation problem: income is taxed in the hands of the domestic shareholder before any distribution, yet may also have been taxed at the subsidiary level in its state of residence. Without appropriate relief mechanisms, this results in economic double taxation—taxation of the same economic income in the hands of different taxpayers.

The OECD Commentary acknowledges that states applying CFC rules should provide relief for underlying foreign taxes paid by the CFC. This ensures that the anti-avoidance objective of CFC legislation is achieved without creating excessive tax burdens that would distort investment decisions or penalise legitimate business structures.

#### 5.2. Credit Mechanisms

Jurisdictions typically address CFC double taxation through indirect or underlying foreign tax credits. Under US law, IRC Section 960 provides deemed-paid foreign tax credits for taxes attributable to Subpart F and GILTI inclusions, allowing corporate shareholders to credit a portion of the CFC's foreign taxes against their US liability on the attributed income. The credit mechanism recognises that the income has already borne foreign taxation at the entity level.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 modified the indirect foreign tax credit for net CFC tested income, raising the allowable credit from eighty to ninety percent while retaining the requirement that foreign taxes be properly attributable to tested income. These adjustments reflect ongoing efforts to balance anti-avoidance objectives with relief from double taxation.

### 6. Dissenting Views and Judicial Decisions

#### 6.1. Reservations to the OECD Commentary

Not all OECD members accept that CFC rules are compatible with tax treaties. Belgium has formally reserved its position, maintaining that CFC legislation conflicts with Articles 7(1), 10(5), and particularly Article 7(1) of the OECD Model. Belgium argues that attributing income to shareholders through CFC rules increases the tax base in the shareholder state by means of income from a foreign entity not liable to tax in the shareholder state according to the treaty's terms.

Switzerland has similarly expressed the view that CFC rules may be contrary to Article 7(1) in certain circumstances, particularly where the rules apply to active business income rather than passive investment returns. These reservations indicate that the OECD consensus position, while widely accepted, is not universally endorsed even among member states.

#### 6.2. Judicial Decisions Questioning Compatibility

Courts in some jurisdictions have questioned or rejected the OECD Commentary's compatibility position. In a notable French case, the Conseil d'État ruled that the France-Switzerland tax treaty, based on the OECD Model, prevented application of French CFC rules to a Swiss subsidiary. The court held that Article 7(1) allocated exclusive taxing rights over business profits to Switzerland, precluding France from taxing those profits through attribution to French shareholders.

Such decisions highlight that treaty interpretation ultimately rests with national courts, which may reach conclusions differing from the OECD Commentary's guidance. The introduction of Article 1(3) in the 2017 Model addresses this uncertainty for treaties incorporating the saving clause, but many existing treaties predate this provision and remain subject to traditional interpretive approaches.

### 7. Practical Implications

#### 7.1. Treaty Planning Considerations

The interaction between CFC rules and tax treaties creates important planning considerations for multinational groups. Structures involving controlled subsidiaries in treaty partner states must account for potential CFC exposure in the parent company's jurisdiction, even where the treaty would otherwise provide relief from source state taxation on the underlying income.

The presence or absence of a saving clause in applicable treaties affects the legal analysis. Treaties incorporating Article 1(3) provide clearer authority for residence state CFC application, while older treaties may present greater uncertainty depending on domestic court approaches to treaty interpretation. Groups should also consider whether applicable treaties contain specific anti-avoidance provisions that might independently address the transactions at issue.

#### 7.2. Relief and Compliance

Ensuring appropriate credit for foreign taxes becomes essential where CFC rules apply to treaty-protected income. Groups must maintain documentation supporting claimed credits and track the attribution of foreign taxes to specific income categories. The complexity of credit calculations increases where multiple tiers of foreign subsidiaries exist or where blended CFC regimes like GILTI aggregate income across jurisdictions.

Compliance obligations extend beyond tax calculation to information reporting requirements. Most CFC regimes require detailed disclosure of controlled foreign entity structures, income, and taxes paid, enabling tax authorities to verify proper application of attribution rules and claimed double taxation relief.
