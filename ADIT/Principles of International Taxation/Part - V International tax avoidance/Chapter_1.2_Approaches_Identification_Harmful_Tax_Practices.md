## Chapter 1.2: Approaches to Identification of Harmful Tax Practices

### 1. Conceptual Framework for Identifying Harmful Practices

#### 1.1. Distinguishing Tax Competition from Harmful Practices

Tax competition among jurisdictions is not inherently harmful. States retain sovereign authority to determine their own tax systems, and competition can promote efficiency, encourage fiscal discipline, and attract legitimate investment. The challenge lies in distinguishing between acceptable tax competition and practices that cause harm to other jurisdictions through erosion of their tax bases.

Harmful tax practices arise when jurisdictions combine low or preferential rates with features that facilitate the artificial shifting of profits without corresponding economic activity. The OECD's framework recognises that the determining factor is not low taxation itself, but rather the combination of low rates with other characteristics—particularly the absence of substantial economic activity, lack of transparency, and ineffective exchange of information—that enable one jurisdiction to poach the tax base of another.

The effects of harmful tax practices include distortion of trade and investment patterns, erosion of national tax bases, and shifting of the tax burden from mobile capital income onto less mobile bases such as labour and consumption. These practices undermine the fairness of tax structures and can discourage voluntary compliance by taxpayers who perceive the system as inequitable. The degree of harm varies depending on which features are present and their combined effect (covered in December 2023).

#### 1.2. Tax Havens versus Preferential Regimes

The 1998 OECD report established a fundamental distinction between two categories of harmful practices that continues to inform international standards.

Tax havens are jurisdictions that position themselves as places for non-residents to escape taxation otherwise due in their home countries. The jurisdiction itself typically has no or minimal taxation and does not seek to attract genuine economic activity. The classic tax haven offers its primary "product" as freedom from tax obligations elsewhere, combined with secrecy protections that shield taxpayers from detection by their home authorities.

Preferential tax regimes represent a different phenomenon. These are special arrangements within otherwise normal tax systems that provide preferential treatment to certain mobile activities or income types. A jurisdiction may have a reasonable general tax system but offer reduced rates, exemptions, or special treatment for particular categories—often targeting mobile financial or intangible income that can easily be booked in any location. The preferential regime may be designed to attract investment that would otherwise go elsewhere, creating competitive advantages that can harm other jurisdictions.

This distinction matters because the approaches to identification and the applicable standards differ. Tax havens are identified primarily by their fundamental nature as zero-tax refuges without economic substance. Preferential regimes require more detailed analysis of specific features that make an otherwise acceptable system potentially harmful.

### 2. The 1998 Criteria Framework

#### 2.1. Four Factors for Identifying Tax Havens

The 1998 report established four key factors for identifying tax havens that remain foundational to the international framework.

The first factor is no or only nominal taxation. This is the starting point for identification but is not harmful in itself. A jurisdiction may legitimately choose to fund government through means other than income taxation. What triggers concern is when this low-tax environment is combined with other features that facilitate base erosion.

The second factor is lack of effective exchange of information. Tax havens typically have laws or administrative practices that prevent the sharing of relevant taxpayer information with other jurisdictions. Without access to information, residence countries cannot verify that their taxpayers are properly reporting income earned through haven structures.

The third factor is lack of transparency in the operation of the legislative, legal, or administrative provisions. This may include secret rulings or negotiated tax arrangements not available to the public, or administrative practices that differ from published rules. Lack of transparency prevents other jurisdictions from understanding how their taxpayers might be exploiting the haven.

The fourth factor is the absence of a requirement for substantial activities. When a jurisdiction allows entities to be established and income to be booked without requiring any genuine economic presence or activity, it facilitates pure profit shifting divorced from real operations.

#### 2.2. Four Factors for Identifying Harmful Preferential Regimes

For preferential regimes within otherwise normal tax systems, the 1998 framework identified four factors that may indicate harmfulness.

The first factor is no or low effective tax rate on the relevant income. This may result from a low headline rate or from the way the tax base is determined. The comparison is typically to the jurisdiction's general rate for similar income.

The second factor is ring-fencing of the regime from the domestic economy. Ring-fenced regimes are partly or fully insulated from domestic markets—the benefits are available only to non-residents or for transactions with non-residents, or the preferential income cannot be used for domestic business. This design reveals that the jurisdiction seeks to attract foreign-source mobile income while protecting its own domestic tax base.

The third factor is lack of transparency. As with tax havens, this includes secret rulings, non-publication of administrative guidance, and practices that differ from published rules.

The fourth factor is lack of effective exchange of information. The regime may include provisions that prevent or discourage sharing information with treaty partners or international administrative networks.

#### 2.3. Ring-Fencing as a Key Indicator

Ring-fencing merits particular attention as a distinctive feature of harmful preferential regimes. When a jurisdiction explicitly or implicitly excludes domestic taxpayers or domestic transactions from a preferential regime, it signals that the jurisdiction considers the regime's benefits inappropriate for its own economy but acceptable to offer as an attraction for foreign capital.

Common ring-fencing techniques include restricting benefits to non-resident companies, limiting eligibility to income from foreign sources, prohibiting beneficiaries from conducting business in the domestic market, and requiring that transactions be with non-residents. The presence of ring-fencing strongly suggests the regime is designed to attract mobile income without corresponding economic activity in the jurisdiction.

The international community views ring-fencing as particularly problematic because it represents a deliberate choice to compete for other jurisdictions' tax bases while protecting one's own. A jurisdiction that genuinely believed its preferential regime was sound policy would typically extend it to domestic taxpayers as well.

### 3. Substantial Activity Requirements

#### 3.1. The Substance Criterion

The substance requirement was included in the 1998 framework but was effectively dropped for tax havens in 2001, on grounds that it was difficult to apply. The BEPS Action 5 report in 2015 restored substance as a key factor, recognising that transparency alone was insufficient to address profit shifting to jurisdictions without genuine economic activity (covered in June 2023).

The conceptual basis for the substance requirement is that taxation should align with the location where value is created and economic activities occur. If a jurisdiction allows entities to book significant income without performing the activities that generate that income, it facilitates artificial profit shifting. Requiring substantial activities ensures that preferential tax benefits flow to entities actually conducting the relevant business operations.

The modern framework distinguishes between two categories of activities with different substance requirements: intellectual property regimes subject to the modified nexus approach, and non-IP regimes subject to separate substantial activities requirements.

#### 3.2. Non-IP Regime Requirements

For preferential regimes covering non-IP mobile activities—including headquarters, distribution centres, service centres, financing, leasing, fund management, banking, insurance, shipping, and holding companies—the substance requirement focuses on core income generating activities.

The requirement operates through a two-step approach. First, jurisdictions must require that core income generating activities be undertaken by the qualifying taxpayer. For regimes outside the European Union, an alternative is that activities be undertaken within the jurisdiction providing benefits, though the taxpayer-based test is preferred. Second, jurisdictions must establish effective mechanisms to review compliance with these requirements.

Core income generating activities vary by sector. For headquarters operations, activities include strategic decision-making and management oversight. For financing, they include managing funding requirements and capital, and bearing and managing financing risks. For holding companies, they include investment decisions and portfolio management. For each type of mobile activity, the FHTP has identified the specific functions that must be performed.

Compliance is assessed by examining whether an adequate number of full-time employees with appropriate qualifications work in the jurisdiction, whether adequate operating expenditure is incurred, and whether the entity has its own premises for conducting activities. Outsourcing arrangements are permitted only where the entity retains control and management of outsourced functions.

#### 3.3. Core Income Generating Activities

The core income generating activities requirement represents the practical application of the substance principle. For each type of preferential regime, the relevant core activities must be identified and assessed.

For shipping companies, core activities include managing crew, overseeing vessel operations, and maintaining vessels. For banking, they include raising funds, managing risk, and providing loans. For insurance, they include underwriting risk and managing claims. For distribution and service centres, they include procurement, logistics, and customer service.

The distinction between core and ancillary activities is important. Administrative functions like accounting, legal compliance, and human resources management are ancillary activities that do not themselves satisfy the substance requirement. A company cannot demonstrate substance merely by having a local office that handles administrative matters while all substantive business decisions and operations occur elsewhere.

### 4. The Modified Nexus Approach for IP Regimes

#### 4.1. Qualifying IP Assets

Intellectual property regimes, including patent boxes and innovation boxes, allow income from IP exploitation to be taxed at preferential rates. These regimes were particularly controversial because they could attract mobile IP income without requiring the underlying research and development activities that created the intellectual property.

The modified nexus approach applies to qualifying IP assets, which are defined narrowly. Qualifying assets include patents, both broadly defined to include utility models, supplementary protection certificates, and extensions of patent protection. Copyrighted software also qualifies. Other IP assets are eligible only where they are certified by a governmental authority following a transparent process—primarily pharmaceutical approvals for new drugs.

Marketing-related intellectual property is explicitly excluded. Trademarks, brand names, and similar assets do not qualify because they are typically created through marketing expenditure rather than research and development, and their value often reflects market position rather than innovative activity. This exclusion prevents regimes from providing preferential treatment to income that has no connection to R&D substance.

#### 4.2. The Nexus Ratio Calculation

The nexus approach operates through a formula that links preferential tax treatment to the taxpayer's own R&D activities. The core principle is that benefits should be proportional to the extent the taxpayer itself performed the research that generated the qualifying IP.

The formula calculates qualifying income as: (Qualifying Expenditure / Overall Expenditure) × IP Income.

Qualifying expenditure includes R&D costs incurred directly by the taxpayer using its own employees and facilities. It also includes costs paid to unrelated parties for R&D performed on the taxpayer's behalf at arm's length. These represent genuine expenditure by the taxpayer on innovative activities.

Overall expenditure includes all costs to develop the IP. In addition to qualifying expenditure, this encompasses acquisition costs where the IP was purchased from another party, and related-party R&D costs where the taxpayer paid an affiliate within its corporate group to perform R&D. These costs are included in the denominator because they represent development activities, but they are excluded from the numerator because the taxpayer did not itself perform the underlying work (covered in June 2023).

#### 4.3. The Thirty Percent Uplift

Recognising that complete exclusion of acquisition and related-party costs could be excessively restrictive, the modified nexus approach includes a thirty percent uplift mechanism. Taxpayers may add to their qualifying expenditure an additional amount equal to thirty percent of that qualifying expenditure, up to the total of their acquisition and related-party costs.

The effect is that taxpayers who perform substantial R&D themselves receive partial credit for any additional acquisition or group R&D costs. If a company incurs one hundred in qualifying expenditure and fifty in related-party R&D costs, it may add thirty to its qualifying expenditure for the nexus calculation, resulting in one hundred thirty qualifying expenditure against one hundred fifty overall expenditure.

The uplift is capped at the actual amount of non-qualifying costs, preventing taxpayers from claiming credit for expenditure they did not incur. A company with one hundred in qualifying expenditure but only ten in acquisition costs could add only ten to its qualifying expenditure, not the theoretical thirty percent maximum.

This mechanism ensures that the nexus approach focuses benefits on taxpayers with genuine R&D substance while providing limited recognition that some involvement of group resources or acquired IP may be commercially appropriate.

### 5. Transparency Requirements

#### 5.1. Exchange of Information Standards

Effective exchange of information is essential to countering harmful tax practices. Without access to relevant taxpayer information, residence countries cannot verify compliance or detect artificial structures designed to shift profits to preferential regimes.

The exchange of information standard has evolved from the on-request model of bilateral tax information exchange agreements to more comprehensive frameworks. Automatic exchange of financial account information under the Common Reporting Standard provides residence countries with data about their taxpayers' offshore accounts. Country-by-country reporting under BEPS Action 13 provides high-level information about multinational enterprises' global allocation of income and taxes.

For harmful tax practices specifically, jurisdictions must not have laws or practices that impede effective exchange. Bank secrecy provisions that prevent sharing information with treaty partners, nominee arrangements that obscure beneficial ownership, and administrative practices that delay or obstruct information requests all indicate potential harmfulness.

#### 5.2. Rulings Transparency Framework

The transparency framework on tax rulings represents a specific response to concerns that confidential advance rulings could facilitate harmful tax practices. The framework requires compulsory spontaneous exchange of information on taxpayer-specific rulings that could give rise to BEPS concerns.

Six categories of rulings are covered: rulings relating to preferential regimes; unilateral advance pricing agreements and other cross-border transfer pricing rulings; rulings providing for downward adjustment of taxable profits; permanent establishment rulings determining that an activity does not constitute a PE or determining the profits attributable to a PE; related party conduit rulings; and any other rulings the FHTP identifies as relevant.

When a jurisdiction issues a ruling in one of these categories, it must spontaneously provide summary information to affected jurisdictions—typically the ultimate parent country and, for transfer pricing rulings, the countries of immediate related parties. This ensures that countries whose tax bases might be affected by the ruling have the information needed to verify appropriate treatment.

### 6. Classification and Peer Review Outcomes

#### 6.1. Harmful, Not Harmful, and Potentially Harmful

The FHTP peer review process classifies preferential regimes into three categories based on assessment against the applicable criteria.

Harmful regimes are those that fail to meet the required standards. For IP regimes, this means the regime does not comply with the modified nexus approach. For non-IP regimes, it means the regime lacks adequate substantial activities requirements. A harmful determination typically triggers a recommendation that the regime be abolished or amended.

Not harmful regimes meet all applicable requirements. An IP regime that fully implements the nexus approach with proper tracking of qualifying and overall expenditure, and that limits benefits to qualifying IP assets, receives a not harmful determination. A non-IP regime with robust requirements for core income generating activities and effective enforcement mechanisms is also classified as not harmful.

Potentially harmful regimes have features that could facilitate BEPS but have not yet been fully assessed, often because the regime is new or undergoing amendment. These regimes are subject to ongoing monitoring until a definitive assessment can be made.

Since the BEPS project began, the FHTP has reviewed 332 preferential regimes. Over forty percent have been abolished or are being abolished, with the remainder assessed as not harmful or amended to achieve compliance.

#### 6.2. No or Nominal Tax Jurisdictions

For jurisdictions with no or only nominal corporate income taxation, the substance standard applies directly to all relevant mobile activities, not only to preferential regimes. These jurisdictions must enact and enforce economic substance legislation requiring entities to demonstrate substantial activities appropriate to their operations.

Twelve jurisdictions are currently identified as no or nominal tax jurisdictions meeting the substance standard: Anguilla, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United Arab Emirates. The UAE was removed from this category following introduction of its nine percent corporate income tax in June 2023.

Annual monitoring reviews compliance with substance requirements in these jurisdictions. The fourth annual review, completed in December 2024, confirmed all jurisdictions maintained the necessary legislative framework, though recommendations for improvement were made regarding monitoring and enforcement in certain jurisdictions.

The substance standard for no or nominal tax jurisdictions ensures a level playing field with preferential regimes in normal-tax jurisdictions. Without this standard, multinationals could avoid substance requirements by establishing entities in zero-tax locations rather than in preferential regimes, undermining the entire framework.
