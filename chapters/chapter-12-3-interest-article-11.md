**Why This Matters for Your Exam:**
Article 11 appears in half of recent ADIT papers, typically as a full 25-mark question. Examiners test three main areas: (1) the policy rationale for withholding taxes on interest, (2) BEPS Action 4 interest limitation rules, and (3) practical scenarios distinguishing interest from dividends. You must understand both the treaty framework and contemporary BEPS developments.

## 1. Concept Foundation

### 1.1 What is Interest? The Article 11(3) Definition

Interest represents the return on capital lent—the price paid by a borrower for the use of someone else's money over time. Unlike dividends, which represent a share of business profits dependent on company performance, interest compensates the lender for temporarily giving up control of their capital. This fundamental distinction drives different treaty treatment: interest arises from a contractual obligation to repay, while dividends arise from ownership of an enterprise.

Article 11(3) of the OECD MTC defines **interest** as:

> "Income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures."

This definition matters because examiners frequently test whether a payment qualifies as interest under Article 11 or as a dividend under Article 10—particularly for hybrid instruments.

**Key characteristics of interest:**
| Feature | Interest (Art 11) | Dividend (Art 10) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Source | Debt-claim | Equity participation |
| Return type | Fixed or determinable | Dependent on profits |
| Principal | Repayable | Not repayable |
| Legal form | Loan, bond, debenture | Share, stock |

The definition explicitly includes income from debt-claims "carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits." This creates overlap with profit-participating loans, which look similar to equity but remain debt. When faced with a hybrid instrument, ask: *Is the principal repayable?* If yes, it's likely debt; the return is interest.

Penalty interest for late payment is generally not covered by Article 11 as it compensates for damages rather than representing income from capital (Commentary, paragraph 21).

### 1.2 The Taxing Rights Framework

Article 11 establishes a **shared taxing right** between residence and source states—a compromise reflecting competing interests of capital-exporting and capital-importing countries.

**Article 11(1) – Residence State Taxation:**
> "Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State."

The residence state (where the beneficial owner resides) has primary taxing rights. The word "may" confirms the right but doesn't create an obligation—domestic law determines actual taxation.

**Article 11(2) – Limited Source State Taxation:**
> "However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest."

The source state (where the payer resides) can tax, but only up to **10% of gross interest** if the beneficial owner condition is met. This 10% cap is the OECD default—actual treaty rates vary.

**Why shared taxation?**
The compromise reflects that:
- Source states contribute infrastructure enabling debt financing
- Residence states bear administrative costs of taxing their residents
- Limiting source taxation encourages cross-border lending
- Some source taxation acknowledges the economic connection

Unlike royalties under Article 12 OECD MTC (exclusive residence taxation), interest retains limited source taxation. This reflects the historical importance of interest flows and the difficulty of completely eliminating source taxation.

### 1.3 The Beneficial Ownership Requirement

The reduced 10% rate only applies if the recipient is the **beneficial owner** of the interest. This prevents treaty shopping through conduit arrangements.

**What beneficial ownership means:**
The OECD Commentary clarifies that "beneficial owner" has an **international fiscal meaning**, not determined by any one country's domestic law. The beneficial owner is the person with:
- The right to use and enjoy the interest
- No contractual or legal obligation to pass the payment to another person
- Unconstrained power to determine the use of the income

**Who is NOT a beneficial owner:**
- **Agents:** Acting on behalf of a principal
- **Nominees:** Holding legal title for another
- **Conduit companies:** With very narrow powers, acting as mere fiduciaries

The Commentary provides the classic example: a conduit company that receives interest but is contractually obligated to pass it to a resident of a third state is not the beneficial owner. The substance-over-form approach applies—look at who truly benefits economically.

**Practical application:**
In back-to-back financing arrangements, Company A (State X) lends to Company B (State Y), which immediately on-lends to Company C (State Z) on matching terms. Company B likely fails the beneficial ownership test because it has no real economic stake in the interest—it simply passes it through.

### 1.4 Source Rules: Where Does Interest "Arise"?

Determining where interest "arises" is critical because it identifies which state can exercise source taxation rights. Without clear source rules, competing claims could create double taxation or opportunities for double non-taxation. The treaty adopts practical tests linking interest to the payer's residence or PE—recognising that the economic activity generating interest typically occurs where the borrower operates.

**Article 11(4) – The Source Rule:**
Interest is deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer:
- Is a resident of that state, OR
- Has a permanent establishment (PE) in that state and the debt was incurred in connection with that PE

This rule determines which state can exercise source taxation rights. If a German company pays interest to a UK creditor, the interest "arises" in Germany, giving Germany source taxation rights (subject to the 10% limit).

**The PE exception:**
If a UK company has a PE in Germany, and that PE borrows money, interest paid by the PE arises in Germany—even though the company is UK resident. The debt must be "incurred in connection with" the PE, meaning the PE bears the interest expense.

**Article 11(5) – PE Attribution:**
When the beneficial owner has a PE in the source state and the debt-claim is "effectively connected" with that PE, Article 11 doesn't apply. Instead, Article 7 (Business Profits) governs, allowing full taxation of the interest as part of PE profits.

This prevents taxpayers from artificially separating interest income from PE activities to access lower withholding rates.

### 1.5 Special Relationships: Article 11(6)

Article 11(6) addresses **non-arm's length interest**:

> "Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount."

**What this means:**
- Treaty benefits (the 10% cap) apply only to arm's length interest
- Excess interest is taxed according to domestic law and other treaty provisions
- The "special relationship" includes associated enterprises but is broader

**Interaction with Article 9:**
Article 11(6) complements rather than replaces Article 9 (Associated Enterprises). Article 9 allows adjustment of profits; Article 11(6) addresses treaty qualification of the payment. The 2025 OECD MTC Update Commentary confirms that domestic thin capitalisation and interest limitation rules can apply even where interest is arm's length under Article 9—a critical point for exam answers.

**Example:**
Parent Co lends €100m to Subsidiary at 15% interest when arm's length would be 5%. The excess 10% (€10m) is not protected by Article 11(2)'s 10% cap. The source state can:
1. Deny interest deduction for €10m (domestic law)
2. Apply full domestic WHT rates to €10m
3. Potentially recharacterise €10m as a dividend under Article 10

### 1.6 BEPS Action 4: Interest Deductibility Limits

BEPS Action 4 addresses base erosion through excessive interest deductions—a critical contemporary topic tested in December 2024.

**The Problem:**
Multinational groups can:
- Allocate high third-party debt to high-tax jurisdictions
- Use intra-group loans to shift profits via interest deductions
- Finance tax-exempt income with deductible interest

Interest deductions are attractive for BEPS because they're easy to implement ("with the stroke of a pen") and may not affect consolidated accounts.

**The BEPS Action 4 Solution: Three-Element Approach**

**1. Fixed Ratio Rule:**
Limits net interest deductions to **10-30% of tax-EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation).

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Net interest | Interest expense minus interest income |
| Tax-EBITDA | Taxable earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation |
| Ratio corridor | Countries choose 10-30% based on policy objectives |

The UK implemented at 30% (the generous end). Factors favouring higher ratios include: operating the rule in isolation, no carryforward of unused capacity, and higher domestic interest rates.

**2. Group Ratio Rule:**
Allows entities to deduct more interest if consistent with the group's worldwide leverage:

> If group consolidated accounts show net third-party interest at 40% of EBITDA, group companies can deduct up to 40% of their tax-EBITDA.

This recognises that some groups are highly leveraged for non-tax reasons (e.g., capital-intensive industries).

**3. Targeted Rules:**
Address specific risks not covered by the general rules, particularly for banking and insurance sectors where normal leverage ratios don't apply.

**Exam Relevance:**
December 2024 Q2 asked candidates to evaluate whether BEPS Action 4 "successfully limits excessive interest deductions while balancing the need for legitimate financial flexibility." Your answer must address both the fixed ratio rule's effectiveness and its potential to restrict legitimate financing.

### 3.1 Worked Example 1: December 2024 Q2 – BEPS Action 4 (25 marks)

#### The Question

> "You are required to consider to what extent it can be said that the approach taken in BEPS Action 4 successfully limits excessive interest deductions, while balancing the need for legitimate financial flexibility in multinational enterprises."

#### Model Answer

**Introduction** (4 marks, 6 minutes)

BEPS Action 4 addresses base erosion involving interest deductions, recognising that multinational groups can manipulate taxable income through debt allocation. The mobility of money enables groups to: (1) allocate third-party debt to high-tax jurisdictions; (2) use intra-group loans to generate deductions exceeding actual third-party interest costs; and (3) fund tax-exempt income with deductible interest.

The 2015 Final Report established a common approach linking net interest deductions to economic activity, measured by taxable EBITDA. This was updated in 2016 with additional guidance on the group ratio rule and sector-specific treatment.

**Fixed Ratio Rule** (6 marks, 10 minutes)

The primary mechanism limits net interest deductions to a fixed percentage of tax-EBITDA within a 10-30% corridor. Countries choose their benchmark based on policy objectives—the UK implemented at 30%.

The fixed ratio rule offers several advantages for limiting BEPS:
- **Simplicity:** Easier to administer than arm's length analysis
- **Predictability:** Clear threshold for taxpayers
- **Effectiveness:** Directly caps deductions regardless of transaction structure

However, the 30% corridor has been criticised as "too generous." Research indicates most large MNEs (outside financial services) have net interest/EBITDA ratios below 10%. The higher end of the corridor may permit deductions exceeding actual third-party costs.

**Group Ratio Rule** (5 marks, 8 minutes)

Recognising that some groups are highly leveraged for non-tax reasons, Action 4 provides an optional group ratio rule. This allows entities to deduct net interest up to the group's worldwide net third-party interest/EBITDA ratio.

The group ratio rule provides flexibility by aligning individual entity treatment with group-level economic reality. Capital-intensive industries (utilities, infrastructure) may legitimately require higher leverage. However, the rule adds complexity—entities must calculate group-level ratios from consolidated accounts, increasing compliance burden.

**Flexibility Provisions** (4 marks, 7 minutes)

Additional flexibility mechanisms include:
- **De minimis threshold:** Small amounts exempt from limitation
- **Carryforward of disallowed interest:** Can be deducted in future years
- **Carryforward of unused capacity:** Permits higher deductions when EBITDA increases
- **Sector exemptions:** Banking and insurance may be excluded where features reduce BEPS risk

These provisions acknowledge that rigid application would harm legitimate financing while maintaining anti-avoidance objectives.

**Evaluation** (4 marks, 8 minutes)

*Success in limiting BEPS:*
Action 4 has been widely implemented, creating coordinated international standards. The fixed ratio approach avoids arm's length manipulation and provides clear limits. Implementation has likely reduced aggressive interest allocation strategies.

*Concerns regarding legitimate flexibility:*
The fixed ratio may be "overly restrictive for certain industries" not accommodating legitimate high-leverage business models. During economic downturns, EBITDA fluctuations may disallow commercially necessary interest. The group ratio rule adds complexity while the fixed ratio's rigidity is acknowledged as "a suitable price for simplicity."

*Implementation challenges:*
Different countries adopting different ratios within the corridor creates inconsistency. MNEs operating across multiple jurisdictions face increased compliance burden where approaches differ.

**Conclusion** (2 marks, 4 minutes)

BEPS Action 4 represents significant progress in addressing interest-based profit shifting through a standardised, administrable approach. The fixed ratio rule successfully limits opportunities for base erosion that arm's length principles struggled to address. However, the 10-30% corridor permits variation that may undermine consistency, and the approach may not fully accommodate diverse business financing needs. The group ratio rule provides essential flexibility but at the cost of complexity. Overall, Action 4 achieves its primary objective while creating implementation challenges requiring ongoing coordination.

### 3.2 Worked Example 2: June 2024 Q5 – WHT on Passive Income (25 marks)

#### The Question

> "You are required to prepare a report explaining:
> 1) the factors influencing a country's decision to impose withholding taxes (WHTs) on passive income earned by non-residents; and (12)
> 2) the reasons why countries might adjust the application of WHTs under their domestic law when considering WHTs within a double tax agreement context, particularly in relation to any conditions for reductions or exemptions from taxation in the source state. (13)
>
> Your report should include references to relevant OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 provisions and the Commentary, where applicable."

#### Model Answer

**REPORT: Withholding Taxes on Passive Income**

**Part 1: Factors Influencing WHT Imposition on Non-Residents** (12 marks, 22 minutes)

**Nature of Withholding Tax**

Withholding tax (WHT) on passive income involves automatic deduction of tax from payments—such as dividends, interest, and royalties—before these amounts are paid to non-resident recipients. The payer (typically a resident entity) deducts and remits tax to the revenue authority; recipients receive amounts net of WHT.

**Factor 1: Tax Jurisdiction and Revenue Collection**

WHT enables source countries to exercise taxing rights over income generated within their borders. Without WHT, non-residents earning passive income may avoid source state taxation entirely—particularly where they have no ongoing presence or assets to enforce against. WHT secures revenue from cross-border economic activities, ensuring non-residents contribute to public finances of countries where income originates.

This reflects the benefit principle: countries providing infrastructure, legal systems, and economic environments enabling income generation should receive tax revenue from that income.

**Factor 2: Administrative Efficiency and Simplicity**

WHT streamlines tax collection by placing the compliance obligation on resident payers rather than non-resident recipients. Payers are accessible to domestic authorities, familiar with local requirements, and have ongoing relationships with tax administrations.

This mechanism:
- Reduces reliance on non-resident voluntary compliance
- Eliminates need for non-residents to file local returns (where WHT is final)
- Lowers administrative costs for both taxpayers and authorities
- Enables real-time revenue collection aligned with payment timing

**Factor 3: Enforcement and Compliance**

WHT addresses enforcement challenges inherent in cross-border taxation. Non-residents may have limited presence, assets, or incentives to comply with source state obligations. WHT shifts the compliance burden to accessible resident payers, reducing evasion risk.

The mechanism also creates audit trails—WHT returns enable authorities to track cross-border payments and verify proper taxation. This supports broader information exchange objectives under Article 26 OECD MTC.

**Factor 4: Equity and Fairness**

WHT promotes horizontal equity between residents and non-residents earning similar income within a jurisdiction. Absent WHT, non-residents might escape taxation that residents bear on equivalent income, creating competitive distortions.

However, WHT typically applies to gross amounts without deductions, potentially creating vertical inequity where effective rates exceed those applicable to net income taxation of residents.

**Factor 5: Policy Objectives**

Despite general application, governments retain flexibility to vary WHT rates by income type or recipient category to achieve policy goals. For example:
- Lower rates on interest to encourage foreign lending
- Exemptions for financial institutions to facilitate capital markets
- Higher rates on royalties to capture technology transfer value

**Part 2: DTA Adjustments to Domestic WHT Application** (13 marks, 24 minutes)

**DTAs as Modification of Domestic Law**

Double tax agreements modify domestic WHT application where treaty rates are lower than domestic rates. The treaty framework—particularly Articles 10 (Dividends), 11 (Interest), and 12 (Royalties)—establishes maximum rates the source state may impose, superseding higher domestic rates where conditions are met.

**The Articles 10-12 Framework**

The OECD MTC allocates taxing rights differently for each passive income category:

| Article | Income Type | Source State Right | OECD Rate |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Art 10 | Dividends | Shared | 5% (participation) / 15% (portfolio) |
| Art 11 | Interest | Shared | 10% maximum |
| Art 12 | Royalties | Exclusive residence | 0% (no source taxation) |

Countries agree to these modifications to:
- Eliminate double taxation barriers to cross-border investment
- Encourage capital flows and technology transfer
- Reduce compliance costs for investors
- Provide certainty for business planning

**Conditions for Rate Reductions**

Reduced treaty rates are conditional, ensuring benefits reach intended recipients:

*Beneficial Ownership (Articles 10(2), 11(2)):*
The reduced rate applies only where the recipient is the "beneficial owner"—having unconstrained rights to use and enjoy the income without contractual obligations to pass it to others. The Commentary clarifies this has an "international fiscal meaning" applying substance-over-form analysis.

This condition prevents treaty shopping through conduit arrangements. Interposing an intermediary in a treaty partner state to receive income on behalf of a third-country resident fails the beneficial ownership test (Commentary on Article 11, paragraph 10).

*Shareholding Thresholds (Article 10(2)(a)):*
The 5% dividend rate requires the beneficial owner to hold at least 25% of capital—distinguishing "participation" dividends (lower rate) from "portfolio" dividends (15% rate). This reflects policy favouring direct investment over passive portfolio holdings.

*Exclusion of PE-Connected Income (Articles 10(4), 11(4)):*
Where passive income is effectively connected with a PE the recipient has in the source state, the passive income article doesn't apply. Instead, Article 7 permits full taxation as business profits. This prevents artificial separation of income from related business activities.

**Policy Reasons for DTA Modifications**

*Eliminating Double Taxation:*
WHT at source combined with residence state taxation creates juridical double taxation. Treaties address this through rate limitations (reducing source tax) combined with credit or exemption relief (eliminating residence tax or crediting source tax). Limiting WHT reduces the double taxation burden DTAs are designed to eliminate.

*Encouraging Investment:*
Lower WHT rates reduce investment costs, encouraging cross-border capital flows. Countries accept reduced source taxation expecting reciprocal treatment and increased inward investment. The balance reflects negotiating positions based on capital flow patterns.

*Administrative Simplification:*
Standardised treaty rates reduce complexity compared to varied domestic rates. Common conditions (beneficial ownership) create predictable frameworks reducing disputes and compliance costs.

*Preventing Treaty Abuse:*
While reducing rates, conditions prevent abuse through:
- Beneficial ownership requirements
- Limitation on benefits provisions (Article 29)
- Principal purpose tests
These ensure treaty benefits reach genuine residents conducting real economic activity, not conduit arrangements.

**Conclusion**

Countries impose WHT on non-residents' passive income to secure revenue, ensure compliance, and maintain equity. Within DTAs, countries agree to modify domestic WHT application—reducing rates subject to conditions—to eliminate double taxation, encourage investment, and simplify administration while preventing treaty abuse through beneficial ownership requirements and anti-avoidance provisions.

### 3.3 Worked Example 3: December 2025 Q4 – Financing Options (25 marks)

#### The Question

> "NewCo is considering the following options to raise funds to finance the project:
>
> **Option A** - NewCo will issue ordinary shares. NSU will subscribe for 50%; Solar Inc. (third party) will subscribe for 50%. NewCo will pay dividends twice per year.
>
> **Option B** - NSU will wholly own NewCo. NSU will provide a loan to NewCo at a commercial interest rate. NSU will obtain the loan funds from a government-owned bank at commercial rates.
>
> **Option C** - NewCo will issue to NSU 100% ordinary shares and 100% 'share certificates' with: 5% annual payment on nominal value; payment ranking ahead of dividends; no payment in loss years; no redemption right; ranking equally with ordinary shares on liquidation.
>
> The Auburnium-Bronzia DTA is identical to the OECD MTC 2017. Both countries' domestic regimes are broadly aligned with BEPS Actions.
>
> For each option, advise NSU on the likely allocation of taxing rights under the DTA, should NSU receive income as the beneficial owner. Consider advantages or disadvantages of each option."

#### Model Answer

**ADVICE TO NSU: Taxing Rights Under Auburnium-Bronzia DTA**

**Option A: Equity Investment with Dividends**

*Classification:*
Distributions on ordinary shares constitute **dividends** under Article 10. Article 10(3) defines dividends as "income from shares" and other income "subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares" under the payer state's law.

*Taxing Rights:*
- **Bronzia (source state):** May tax dividends but limited by Article 10(2)
- **Auburnium (residence state):** May tax with credit relief under Article 23B

*WHT Rate:*
NSU holds 50% of NewCo—meeting the 25% threshold in Article 10(2)(a). Therefore, Bronzia WHT is limited to **5%** of gross dividends (not 15% for portfolio holdings).

*Beneficial Ownership:*
NSU as direct shareholder receiving dividends for its own benefit satisfies beneficial ownership. No conduit arrangement exists.

*Advantages:*
- Clear dividend classification—no recharacterisation risk
- 5% WHT rate (participation threshold met)
- No interest deductibility concerns in Bronzia

*Disadvantages:*
- Dividends not deductible by NewCo (paid from after-tax profits)
- No tax shield on finance cost
- Shared ownership dilutes control

**Option B: Debt Financing Through Intercompany Loan**

*Classification:*
Interest on the loan constitutes **interest** under Article 11. The loan creates a debt-claim; returns are fixed (commercial interest rate) and principal is repayable—characteristic of debt, not equity.

*Taxing Rights:*
- **Bronzia (source state):** May tax interest but limited by Article 11(2) to **10%** of gross interest
- **Auburnium (residence state):** May tax with credit relief under Article 23B

*Beneficial Ownership:*
NSU borrows from a government bank and on-lends to NewCo. The question states NSU receives income "as beneficial owner." However, the back-to-back arrangement raises scrutiny. If loan terms match (amount, rate, timing), Bronzia authorities might challenge NSU's beneficial ownership.

Key factors supporting NSU's beneficial ownership:
- NSU bears credit risk on NewCo loan (not guaranteed by bank)
- NSU earns spread (if any) between bank and NewCo rates
- NSU controls whether to make NewCo loan

If beneficial ownership is established, the 10% cap applies.

*Interest Deductibility:*
NewCo can deduct interest payments, reducing Bronzia taxable profits. However, given both countries align with BEPS Actions, Bronzia likely has interest limitation rules (BEPS Action 4). If NewCo's net interest exceeds the fixed ratio threshold (e.g., 30% of EBITDA), excess deductions are denied.

*Article 11(6) Consideration:*
NSU and NewCo are associated enterprises. If the interest rate exceeds arm's length, Article 11(6) applies to excess interest. However, the question states "commercial interest rate"—implying arm's length. No Article 11(6) adjustment should apply.

*Advantages:*
- Interest deductible by NewCo (tax shield)
- 100% ownership maintained
- Clear debt classification

*Disadvantages:*
- 10% WHT (higher than 5% dividend rate on participations)
- BEPS Action 4 may limit NewCo deductions
- Potential beneficial ownership challenge
- Thin capitalisation risk

**Option C: Hybrid Instrument (Share Certificates)**

*Classification Challenge:*
The share certificates have characteristics of both debt and equity:

| Feature | Suggests Debt | Suggests Equity |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| 5% fixed payment | ✓ (fixed return) | |
| Priority over dividends | ✓ (creditor preference) | |
| No payment in loss years | | ✓ (profit-dependent) |
| No redemption right | | ✓ (permanent capital) |
| Equal ranking on liquidation | | ✓ (residual claim) |

*Likely Classification:*
Under Article 10(3), dividends include income "subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares" under Bronzia law. The share certificates:
- Form part of share capital
- Have no redemption right (not repayable)
- Rank equally with ordinary shares on liquidation
- Payments depend on profitability (no payment in loss years)

These characteristics indicate **equity** treatment. The 5% payment would be classified as a dividend under Article 10, not interest under Article 11.

*Taxing Rights:*
If classified as dividends:
- NSU holds 100%—meeting Article 10(2)(a) threshold
- Bronzia WHT limited to **5%**
- Auburnium taxes with credit relief

*Beneficial Ownership:*
NSU as direct holder satisfies beneficial ownership—no intermediary structure.

*Advantages:*
- Potentially lowest effective WHT (5%)
- 100% ownership maintained
- If Bronzia treats as debt domestically, deductions may be available (hybrid mismatch benefit)

*Disadvantages:*
- Classification uncertainty
- If Bronzia recharacterises as equity, no deduction for payments
- BEPS Action 2 anti-hybrid rules may deny benefits if mismatch exists
- Complexity in structuring and documentation

**Comparative Summary**

| Factor | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Income classification | Dividend | Interest | Dividend (likely) |
| Bronzia WHT rate | 5% | 10% | 5% |
| Deductible by NewCo | No | Yes (subject to limits) | Uncertain |
| Beneficial ownership | Clear | Potential challenge | Clear |
| BEPS risk | Low | Action 4 limits | Action 2 mismatch |
| Control | 50% | 100% | 100% |

**Recommendation**

Option B offers tax efficiency through interest deductibility, but higher WHT (10%) and BEPS Action 4 limitations may reduce net benefit. Option A provides certainty with 5% WHT but no deduction. Option C may achieve best outcome (5% WHT with potential deduction) but carries classification risk and anti-hybrid concerns.

For certainty and moderate tax efficiency, **Option A** is preferable if control dilution is acceptable. If 100% ownership is essential and BEPS Action 4 limits are manageable, **Option B** provides deductibility benefits. Option C should be avoided without advance ruling on classification.

## 4. Pattern Variations

Examiners frequently adapt the core Article 11 scenario to test deeper understanding. These variations require candidates to apply foundational knowledge to more complex factual situations, integrating Article 11 with related provisions and contemporary anti-avoidance rules.

### 4.1 Interest Combined with Thin Capitalisation

**How it differs:** Question involves related party lending where debt levels may be excessive, requiring analysis of both treaty and domestic anti-avoidance rules.

**Adaptation:**
- Address Article 11(6) special relationship provision
- Explain domestic thin cap rules interaction with treaty
- Reference BEPS Action 4 and 2025 MTC Update confirming domestic rules can apply even to arm's length financing
- Discuss potential recharacterisation as dividend

### 4.2 Back-to-Back Lending Arrangements

**Recognition:** "Conduit," "intermediary," "back-to-back," "interposed entity"

**Adaptation:**
- Focus on beneficial ownership substance-over-form test
- Apply Commentary examples of persons who are not beneficial owners
- Consider whether intermediary has economic stake vs merely passing through
- Discuss treaty shopping prevention purpose

### 4.3 Hybrid Instruments

**Adaptation:**
- Systematically analyse debt vs equity characteristics
- Apply Article 10(3) dividend definition
- Consider source state domestic law classification
- Address BEPS Action 2 anti-hybrid rules
- Discuss potential mismatch outcomes

### 4.4 Banking Sector Interest

**How it differs:** Financial institution context where normal rules may not apply.

**Recognition:** "Bank," "financial institution," "lending business"
