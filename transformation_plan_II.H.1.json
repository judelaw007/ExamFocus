  "special_instructions": "Article 7 is a foundational treaty provision with complex technical content. The transformation must:\n\n1. PRESERVE TECHNICAL ACCURACY: The AOA explanation, FAR analysis, and free capital attribution are technically sophisticated - do not oversimplify.\n\n2. INTEGRATE RESEARCH SEAMLESSLY: Agent 2's findings on 2025 updates, Hyatt International case, and BEPS developments should enhance technical content, not appear as add-ons.\n\n3. MAINTAIN OECD/UN COMPARISON: The force of attraction rule distinction is critical - the current comparison diagram (lines 313-336) is excellent and should be converted to clear comparative prose.\n\n4. HANDLE DIAGRAMS CAREFULLY: Current chapter uses effective visual diagrams. Convert these to well-structured prose or markdown structures that preserve pedagogical value:\n   - Article 5/7 relationship flowchart → structured prose explanation\n   - AOA two-step process → numbered methodology explanation\n   - Force of attraction comparison → OECD vs UN comparative paragraphs\n   - Priority rules → clear hierarchical explanation\n\n5. SUBTLE EXAM REFERENCES: Use maximum 3 references:\n   - June 2023: Article 7/9 interaction (already excellent technical content)\n   - December 2023: PE profit attribution scenario\n   - One reference to force of attraction (December 2023 or other)\n   Format: Natural integration like 'as examined in June 2023' or '(covered in December 2023)'\n\n6. HIERARCHICAL NUMBERING: Strict adherence to:\n   - Main heading: ### Article 7: Business Profits\n   - Level 1: #### 1. Introduction\n   - Level 2: ##### 1.1. The Role of Article 7\n   - Level 3: ###### 1.1.1. [if needed for complex subsections]\n\n7. TEXTBOOK TONE: Academic but accessible. No:\n   - 'You should know...'\n   - 'In the exam...'\n   - 'Key takeaway...'\n   - 'Remember...'\n   Instead: Declarative statements, analytical explanations, technical precision.\n\n8. REMOVE ALL EXAM COACHING: No frameworks, no mark allocations, no exam strategy. Content should inform understanding, not exam technique.\n\n9. WORD COUNT BALANCE: With removals (~600 words of exam content) and additions (~600 words of research), maintain 2700-3300 range. Prioritize depth over breadth - Level 3 requires sophisticated understanding.\n\n10. CASE INTEGRATION: Hyatt International (2024) should illustrate AOA principle (PE can have positive attribution despite global losses) - integrate as technical example, not exam question."
